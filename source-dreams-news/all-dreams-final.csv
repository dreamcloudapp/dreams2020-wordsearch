I go because I’ve heard that interesting things happen here. Right in front of my car is a huge lizard standing on its back legs. I realize it’s a dinosaur, though part of my mind tries to reason it away because dinosaurs don’t exist. But this one is real. A person goes up to the dinosaur and turns on a light on the side of its head - so it’s like a moving lantern. I continue to explore. There is a white skull of a large bird-like animal in the middle of a blackened circle -a fire pit. The terrain is grassy and hilly. I decide to leave and go home - better not spend too much time here and get caught lurking.",Ana,last_nights_dream

She didn't want me to come, but I convinced her, so I opened the left rear door to the police cruiser and clambered inside. It was a much tighter fit than I had been expecting. This was connected to reducing the mobility and thus potential threat of any criminals who had to be transported.   Before the bust, we had to stop by our house and pick something up, I don't remember what it was distinctly and the only thing that comes to mind is a bottle of wine.

11,1283,,02/01/2020,01/02/2020 00:03,"“The Mission” In this dream I am aware that there are other beings in the world that we live in. They don’t have a body or faces. We can’t see them, I don’t know what they look like but I do know they are there. They reveal other parts of the dimensions that we live in when the right people are gathered together. Some of the people are oblivious to the fact that they’re supposed to gather together and others are not. So the dream flips between scenes where people are gathering. There’s always one person that is aware that the gathering has occurred. In each house where this happens, the curtains are supposed to stay slightly open, and when everyone has arrived, the curtains are closed. And then some other kind of message will come through, left by these other beings. It changes every time. You have to look for it, too. For example, one of them was actually underneath a flyer on a telephone pole. I was looking for the message and kept expanding the search area outside of the house to wider areas until I thought, “The messages are never this far away from the actual home.” So I retraced my steps and went back and found it underneath the flyer. There’s some violence in it that I can’t just speak of. What I came away with from this dream is that there’s a frequency layer on the planet where people just don’t care about the lives of other beings - whether animals, peoples or plants - they are just completely removed from the heartbeats that make things live. The other thing is that when the right people are gathered, you can evolve through that and you move past it. Not past the violence, but past the frequency that’s your everyday existence. But if you lived in isolation and didn't come together in groups, none of these fantastical conversations would happen when you discover something new. The layer of other dimensional beings remained with me when I woke up and I couldn't go back to sleep - it was that other layer of detachment and being observed that I really didn’t like.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream1
12,1284,,02/01/2020,01/02/2020 00:04,"“The Old Rusty Car” (from when I finally went back to bed) In this dream I have a picture of an old rusty car and it’s got a flat back like the kind you can open - I think it’s called a hatchback - only it’s been sitting and not moving for quite some time. The metal has rusted to what I find is a quite beautiful terracotta red-brown color. It’s rusted in panels - the panels of the car are slightly different colors of this terracotta. On the back - the hatchback - it’s made up of 7 different panels and instead of being different shades of terracotta, one is a yellow ochre - an artist color where the ochre pigment has some of that terracotta color in it - and another is a turquoise blue. Some of the panels are those colors. The contrast is absolutely gorgeous. You can see the rough pigments of the metal as it’s coming apart and it’s just gorgeous. I realize that as the dream opens and I have a picture of it, this car is actually a portal. So I’m seeking the portal in the dream. Interestingly, there’s a person in it who I knew as a teenager growing up through my twenties, not a close friend, but someone in my friend group. They had a farm on the outside of town and I was there a couple of times, and one time was an eclipse party when we went out there to watch the eclipse. Anyway, he committed suicide about 5 years ago and I had lost touch - we were never that close - and he was in my dream as a guide. His name was Craig. So I figured out the place this portal is - it’s like I carbon dated the paint pigments (I guess it’s because I do actually paint, I use oil paints) and they can only come from this one possible place, and of course it’s not on a map. So I’m hiking through pathways sequentially and I’ll go back, hike through, I don’t find it, and return to my own home, and go back other times. So I repeatedly went back and each time I went back, he meets me, this Craig guy, except for one time. And that time my dad met me, which is interesting because he’s 80 now and we used to walk a lot but he doesn’t walk for long periods anymore because he has a bad hip. So I have conversations with both of them - conversations about life and reflecting back, memories and philosophical conversations. All of the times where I’m hiking on the path I’m not alone, I’m with Craig, except for the last time. So Craig says, “I’ll leave you here,” and then he disappears. And then I see my dad and he’s already up ahead, so I walk towards him and he’s on the outskirts of a very, very small town. It’s like a beach town, like they have up along Lake Erie in Canada, but they’re just small groupings of houses, maybe that cottagers would require. Because there are cottages built around the shores of a body of water, maybe a marina might pop up and a general store. So it’s just like that. There’s maybe only 5 or 6 buildings in it and one of them is a roadhouse style cottage that serves food and I don’t even know if they have indoor seating, it’s all outdoor with round tables with umbrellas. My dad is sitting underneath one and I go up and sit down beside him. We have a really good conversation, it’s so beautiful. And at the end of the conversation he passes an envelope to me and he says, “I think you’ll recognize what’s in it.” I open it up and it’s a picture of that old rusty car that I love so much. He says, “I can take you to where that is.” And I give him a hug and say okay lets’ go. So we do. We circle around the town and meander between the little cottages and then we come into a dirt, open plaza. There’s that old rusty car. I just look at it, taking in all its colors and textures and then my dad says, “This is where I have to leave you.” And he does. I’m just standing there with the car. I realize if I go into it, I won’t come back out. There’s a whole other world in the car and I’m just staring at it and weighing the odds. All of a sudden at the table where I’ve been sitting is Omar and he has two boxes wrapped up in brown paper and they’re both addressed to me. One of them has a board game in it and the other one says, “You’ll see what it is when you open it. I just want you to have a few things so you know I was here. They won’t be recognized as coming from me because they seem like everyday things.” I just sat there with him and didn’t say anything. He fades away, too, and I go back to the car deciding whether or not it’s time for me to go into it or not. I decide it’s not, but I know where it is now. And then I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream2

16,724,,03/01/2020,01/03/2020 00:02,"At my childhood home there is a family reunion from a few families that are important to me. (In waking life I don’t know these families). A friend John who is in love with me invited his family to meet me, but I am married. He introduces me to the room of people and says we have a lot of history and I balk because it implies something romantic that never was. (In real life he was a high school crush and a pen pal after he moved away). I feel embarrassed and want to confront him but not humiliate him. I wander around and mingle with guests and don’t confront the friend. I fly to China for the marathon but leave mid way through to Iceland airwaves and to do a kayak trip around the island. I don’t finish the race either. I go to my favorite shop in Iceland and there’s a t-shirt that says we’re having a baby and it’s a picture of a tiger and a bird and the baby is a monkey. I go to lunch and my best friend Bea is there and we embrace. (In waking life we recently had a falling out). I tell her I sold the business and that I got invited to join a matchmaking service but I’m married so I don’t want to go. I panic about getting home and also back to China to finish work because I bought a one way ticket. I call to stay with a friend Julia (who I also had an argument with last year and want to patch things up).

17,1285,,03/01/2020,01/03/2020 00:03,"“The Flying Machine” In this dream I’m at my dad and stepmother’s cottage. It’s located in the Boreal Forest and the forest is so thick that you can’t possibly walk through it. There’s no path. There’s no space between the trees and the underbrush. So, there’s just a clearing. My stepmother makes sure that I understand I’m not allowed to sleep in the main cottage, so I have a cabana - a small one room that fits a single bed cot. There’s nothing else in it, just a cot. It’s made of wood and it has a roof and a door. This is where I sleep and I have a flying machine - it’s made of metal and taffeta - weather-proof material that tents are made out of and actually windsurfer sails are also made out of it. It’s like a parasailor. I think in real life, people are led up to gliders to a cliff and then they’re strapped in and then they glide all the way down. This is what it is, only it has a bottom, so I can actually cross my legs, sit in the stretched taffeta material and operate the lever that will lift the wings out so I can go higher or lower that one side of the wing down so I start to come back down towards the earth. So I’m wearing a dress and I walk from my cabana down to the shore, get in my flying machine, and the wind just takes me up. And it’s amazing. It’s so quiet up there - the quiet has texture to it and it just goes through my whole body and I orgasm. I fly around for a while and then I shift the gear and come back down and land the plane. I’ve done this before and I have a picture of me flying it with a friend in it. The friend is there on the shore, but she won’t come up with me in it, although the dream is in multiple timelines so I know she has. She just doesn’t during this particular dream. And then my stepmother creates some drama. She doesn’t want it on the dock and stuff, so I speak to a neighbor and the neighbor tells me it’s fine to leave it there. So I go up in it again and fly around and it’s just so peaceful and so freeing and then I land it when it’s time down on the neighbor’s dock. My stepmother is a little bit pissed off, but what can I say, it’s not her dock. So I go and sleep in the cabana and listen to the birds and the sounds of nature. I go up and down in this thing multiple times. I try to convince my friend to come with me, but she’s scared. I take her for a dry run in it where we don’t leave the land. She doesn’t want to go in it though, so she just wanders off. I fly in it again, land it, and then in the dream, I become bored with doing this in this one particular place. I’m not really welcomed in the cottage, so I decide to do something else and the dream exits that forest and I go back to the city.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream1
18,1286,,03/01/2020,01/03/2020 00:04,"“The Cake” I arrive in the city and I walk over to my lover’s apartment. I tell him that sure, I’ll accompany him to the celebration that one of his colleagues from work is hosting. We are required to bring a dish with us and he doesn’t want to cook something, so we go to a facility where we can cook it at that facility. So we walk to it. We enter the premises and it’s run by a temperamental chef. There’s a counter that has all kinds of small compartments in it and some really interesting tools. I’m looking at all of these and I pick them up and examine them and try to figure out what on earth they’re all for. My lover is talking to the chef because they’re deciding what the creation will become. I realize that all of these little tools are for making wine, but they’re like juicers that you hold in one hand, and that’s why they’re so tiny. You take each grape and put the thing that brings the juice out inside the grape and then turn it until the pulp comes out and then the juice. You do one grape at a time. I think, wow, this is interesting, but it would take such a long time. And then I’m looking at the other, there must be 50 different compartments in this table and they each have a different tiny tool in them. So I’m absorbed in figuring out what each of these are all for and I realize there’s a bit of commotion behind me. I look and there’s this giant cake with icing on it and my lover’s daughter is on the premises - she just appeared. She’s about 10. And she’s trying to taste the cake, of course, and because this dream is also in multiple timelines, I realize she does. But she hasn’t done it yet. Even though she has not done this yet, I see the chunk of cake come out where she’s taken the bite and I see someone else, not the temperamental chef, but a third party who has stepped in and fixed it by mushing some other parts of the cake to fill the hole and with his finger puts the icing across and dabs it across so it doesn’t look like a chunk has been taken out of it, but you can still tell that there is. The temperamental chef sees this and just isn’t upset about it. He’s still going on and having a temper tantrum about whatever else he’s always absorbed with having a temper tantrum about but doesn’t address the cake. Now we’re in a car and we’re driving up this beautiful roadway - it’s like the kind you see in Italy where it just winds around and around and elevates, and there’s this one side of it that has no shoulder but drops down - the kind you don’t want to make a mistake in when you’re driving because it just looks like the car will fall over the side. It’s a perfect day and there’s a bit of a breeze. On the dashboard of this car - it’s a small car - is a convertible - has amazing controls in it. I become absorbed in figuring out what all of these buttons and dials are for. Then I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream2

25,1287,,05/01/2020,01/05/2020 00:02,"“Photographs” The setting is somewhere I’ve never been before. I don’t recognize it. The population is a higher density than I’ve lived anywhere in Canada. I’ve never lived anywhere else other than here, so I'm not sure. The architecture I’m positive is much older than contemporary. It’s not made of stone though, so it’s not Medieval, it’s not Renaissance. I don’t think it’s Northern European either. I’m feeling it’s more Mediterranean or something closer to the Equator, though it’s not as hot climate wise. It’s very colorful. There’s a lot of curves to the architecture and extra pieces added on, too, and it’s not just a box structure. There’s artistic pieces added on so it looks pleasing to the eye. It’s very artsy in this community. People make everything by hand. There’s a lot of thought put into it first. There doesn’t seem to be hierarchy of economy either or social standing. So what you eat, what you wear and your craft are all socially equal. So when you go to have food, you pick each item from the person who has created it. Then you create your food together. You can also go to a cook who is making food for others. You don’t just go in there, order at a counter and buy it. You have a conversation and then the cook shares a dish with you that he/she/they think you would like. So it’s quite different and very beautiful. I am a representative of life. In my dream I’m not called a photographer. I don’t actually have a camera. I have something that takes shadows so it’s a light. There’s a background and then once the light is shined on the object or person, it’s the outline that represents who they are. I make these for people. So they’ll come in and have a conversation with me and when I think it’s time, I’ll shine the light (with their permission, that’s what they’re there for, it’s not uninvited) and create a shadow for them. Lots of times this is done in exchange for foods or other gifts. This is a barter system economy. I’m very happy there. The dream comes to a conclusion in two ways. There seems to be a theme in my dreams lately where they’re both/and. Things are happening at the same time. So at the same time as I am creating a shadow piece for myself, I am also in the place where the person who cooks for other people is cooking. I’m in there just sitting. I’m actually studying some of my own work. The cook is androgynous. That seems to be another theme. I’m talking to them just in little bits. It’s a very comfortable conversation - the way you would have a conversation with someone you lived with for a long period of time where you say a couple of sentences and they respond and you’re both kind of doing your own thing. Fifteen minutes go by and then you make another couple remarks. It’s like that. So I’m in there and I’m aware that there’s a man that comes in. He’s trying to order a sandwich the way we would here now. The cook is not responding to him. So I’m aware that this exchange is unsuccessfully occuring in the sidelines of my consciousness. It gets to a point where I’m uncomfortable continuing to do what I’m doing there because this is disruptive. I’m aware that the cook is agitated. I’m aware also that the man is not going to go away. I feel compassion and want to stand in to alleviate the discomfort. So I go behind where the food is prepared. I start talking to the cook in the way I would talk to the cook before I was offered something to eat, hoping that by modeling the behavior, the man is going to understand. He doesn’t. Instead he thinks that I’m another employee. He starts trying to get me to make the sandwich. I don’t. But the cook responds to me and gives me a couple slices of tomato. So I go get a plate and put the tomato slices on a plate and bring it over to where I had been doing my own work. He looks puzzled at first and then a little bit angry. I assume that he’s been thinking, “Wow, I’ve been standing here asking for something for x number of minutes, and she just walks in there and starts helping herself and gets service.” And then he reaches over as though he’s going to help himself, and then someone else materializes on the scene and grabs his arm and removes it. There’s a commotion. The man is eventually removed because he won’t listen and he won’t start trying to force a sandwich because none is appearing. I realize that I’m describing this, my consciousness is flipping back and forth from this scene through the portal of my work that I’m trying to focus on. In my own work, I am adjusting my own posture so I can get the line of the shadow that I want through this piece. The piece is created by wearing a sarong just between your navel and your hips. It’s not a flowy sarong, it’s more like the ones you see in Egyptian photos where the material is thicker and the piece that hangs over the front is wide - it’s not flowy, it’s made of a stiffer fabric. On the top fabric goes around the ribcage up to the nipples, so they start at the bottom rib - the material is stiffer - and they go up towards the nipples. What keeps happening is every time I adjust this piece of fabric over my own body, it goes over top of my nipples and I’m trying to get it to say just below the line of the nipples so you see the actual line of the nipples in the outline and then it goes down the rest of the body. Also in my dream, my physical body is getting really turned on by this. Every time it happens in my dream, I find it hard to stay in the dream. So the moment I get this right. There it is! The shadow is exactly the way I want it to look and feel, it’s just like Boom! My whole body is electrified. That’s the end of the dream. I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I wanted to talk to A., but he wasn't at the table and he didn't seem to want to approach me. Eventually I rose and mingled with the crowd. I saw many people who I knew and shook a few hands, including that of the Jamison's youngest son. He was positively terrified of me and said nothing while reluctantly shaking my hand. I assumed he was merely shy.   A. walked up to me and we began to converse. I realized that Asher was just as uncomfortable with the current environment as I was and he told me that we should leave so that we could talk more. He left and I ventured out to meet up with him at the location we had specified.  Upon leaving the party, I found that I was at UCF and that my dad was walking with me. I knew that I had to find A. as we walked from the right side of the Chapel toward the Gym. We were walking across the soccer field between the two buildings and all of a sudden I was in the midst of a group of children playing soccer. The ball was soaring around me as if we were playing keep-away. I may have hit the ball a few times, but didn't get seriously involved. When we had moved a little ways further, I saw that my younger brother was with them. We waited on the sidelines for the game to finish and then continued with my brother. We spoke for a minute but I don't remember what we said.   I was on the other side of campus with my dad when we saw A. walk or drive past. We were next to my dad's car, but I didn't want him to drive me to follow Asher though he offered. I wanted to do this on my own, so I took off running back toward the chapel to find Asher. It was raining at this point and I had to use the restroom, but I was determined to find him on my own.  I did find him eventually although I don't know how I got to where he was. Corey was also with him. We spoke for a while and caught up. It was a good conversation though at times I was a little unsure what to say as we'd changed so much.  Without warning, I found myself in a room with Mr. and Mrs. Jamison and my older brother. The Jamisons were on the left where Mrs. Jamison was lying down on her back with Mr. Jamison sitting next to her. Carson was sitting on the far wall and I was on the right also lying down but slightly propped up. We were all talking when, Carson asked Mrs. Jamison why she had refused to let him date their eldest daugher--who in reality never existed as they only had 3 sons. She said something to the effect that she could see even then that Carson was an immoral person although her wording was different. Carson asked if she could really tell at that time because he had hidden it very well and always acted like a good kid. He said that he also only smoked weed once a day at that time.   Mrs. Jamison kind of huffed at this and made a disparaging comment about the use of weed. At this point, I was getting a bit annoyed that Mrs. Jamison was being so disrespectful to my brother, so I said, ""Well that's nothing because I took psychedelics!"" Mr. Jamison actually laughed at this but Mrs. Jamison was offended. I was sure that they would never let me speak with A. again. Mrs. Jamison then began to speak of how terrible marijuana was and of all of its negative effects. Every single time she would bring up a negative point, I would counter it with my experience or scientific research. For example, she said that it caused nausea and I pointed out that in reality they used marijuana to treat nausea in cancer patients.  I felt bad about this after we had argued for a bit and apologized, but at this time I was waking from the dream and my apology was more in the waking world than in the dream world.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

The water is in a gymnasium or a large building and it has filled the gymnasium, almost to the ceiling.

I can stick my head above and be in the gymnasium and stick my head below the water and see it flip so that now my body is above me in the gym and my head is breathing below the line where the water was as I’m looking into this strange bowling alley scene. Then the scene shifts and I’m in a long passageway. It’s small shaped like a chute and we can only swim through it. My daughter is still with me and we’re swimming forward. My dad is behind me at the end of this passageway. He’s urging us to swim, but he feels gross - he’s watching as my legs move, opening to frog legs.

The owners of the gym or building come up to the front desk where I’m sitting. I have a photo of myself completely naked. In the photo, my upper body is facing the camera. My breasts are prominently displayed. The photo itself is sepia-toned like it’s been dyed with onion skin. I don’t want to give it to the owners but they had asked me to come up with a campaign or a slogan or a logo or something for the building. I’m very hesitant because I know that the wife is going to be derogatory and I don’t want to hear what she has to say. When I hand it to them the husband just looks at it with the male gaze taking it in and making some comment about my body which I am irritated with. And then the wife cops an eyebrow and asks why I thought that was a good idea. The scene changes and the wife and I are folding clothes together like you fold clothes at a retail store. She’s showing me these tan pouches that are closed with a zipper and are about 4x6. She tells me that these pouches can help you swim if you put them on your head. And now we are out in a harbor or beach and there’s a swimming race going on. I’m watching mostly men with these pouches on their heads swim out to a buoy and back around. She tells me that I need to swim and I don’t want to because I know that I’m out of shape and I can’t swim and my shoulder hurts. But she says that if I put the pouch on my head, I’ll be fine. It seems silly to me, but I do it anyway, but I can’t see because the pouch is over my eyes. The water is foaming. I can’t see anything as I’m swimming out to the buoy mostly trying not to drown. Then I turn around and dive under the water and suddenly everything is better. I can breathe under the water. I don’t have a stupid pouch on my head. I can see. It is crystal clear. I can see the reef, I can see the fish, I can see the sea anemones. I can see everything under the water. I can even see the swimmers up above me - their bodies swimming over my head. I’m trying to get back to the start - the shore - the beginning - but it’s through a narrow passageway and I can feel how strong the current is. I’m still underwater and I pull myself through the passageway by grabbing on the reef that is below me, pulling myself forward. Then I am out of the water and the race is over. I’m in a home with all these cut strawberries and other fruits on platters with cheese. The wife is there and she’s prepared all these platters for us to eat.

I walk past a front yard with a bunch of my friends sitting at a picnic table - three women sitting there talking. One of the women has long long hair - it touches the bench she’s sitting on. She’s in the middle with two other women sitting on the side. I’m walking down the street with a friend who is gorgeous. I stop and introduce her to the women. The one with the long hair just stops and stares and stares at my friend, doesn’t say much, just drinks her in with her eyes. We sit and chat for a little bit, and then we leave, continuing to walk down the street towards a house I’m staying in.There are a lot of people out and about. There’s a lot of people in this house. This house feels packed, like I’m a roommate with many many others. The house itself has a lot of things in it. It’s a little bit dark. I go to the plants on a windowsill that need watering. I water these plants while my gorgeous friend wanders around. I watch as everybody watches her and tries to watch her and make her acquaintance. Then the scene changes and I’m no longer in the house. I’ve walked out of it, past the women at the picnic table. I hear one of them laughing and giving the long haired woman a hard time about how attracted she was to my friend. She says, “You gave her that new York stare.” I look at the woman with the long hair to see what her response is. She laughs but she also is very very intent on my friend. Then I am in what seems like my childhood home and there’s tons of people there, too. I can’t tell if they’re throwing a party or packing bags or what’s going on. There’s a lot of people and my dad is there and all of my siblings are there. I go out to the backyard. I want to get away from all the people and I want to go to the beach. My dad is standing in the backyard getting us ready to go the beach. He has bags ready to go and next to him is this dog that is as big as a llama. I stare because it is so huge and it starts to talk and tells me it is a dog that is part of llama and is really strong. It’s carrying all of these bags that we’ve packed. Some of the bags are my siblings’, some of the bags are my dad’s. I think he and I have a bag in there. My gorgeous friend is actually still with me somewhere. She’s milling about the house, wandering about the house, and she’s wandering in and out of the backyard. While I’m talking with my brothers and sisters, trying to organize how to get to the beach, she’s in and out and people are still staring, trying to get her attention. I’m becoming agitated because I can tell that I want to get to the beach, but I don’t want to ride with my siblings. I don’t feel comfortable with any of them. I can also tell that all of the strength in my body, all of the muscles I have are gone and it’s been some time since I’ve been able to work out and move. I want to go to the beach so I can get a workout in. It’s beginning to bother me that I don’t have those muscles and it’s beginning to bother me that my friend is not paying any attention to me even though she’s there with me and I know she wants to go to the beach with us. I walk around the corner of the house and there’s a line of cars - the cars that belong to my family and cars that belong to the people that are milling about the house and the yard. There’s two cars we can take to the beach and I tell my siblings that I want to drive them myself. I turn around and call my friend and tell her to come with. She’s aloof and nonchalant. We have an argument. I ask her why she won’t engage with me or speak with me. She knows how much I love her and how much I want her to be with me, and she just does not respond until I grab her wrist. She tells me that we both have work to do and will end up together eventually and I should stop because it makes her sad. Then she walks away and I’m feeling heartbroken. When I look up, my brothers and sisters and dad and the llama dog are gone. They’ve driven off. I grab my bag and run out to the road and start screaming because I can see the van that has my siblings in it as they’re driving off to go to the beach. They stop when they hear me screaming and I run and get into the car and I sit in the back. I’m not happy about that because I get very car sick. But we continue on and I ask where my dad and the llama dog went. The kids say they went to school. My dad had to drop the dog off and leave it at the school. We drive up that direction and my brother is driving too fast for this curvy road and he misses turns. We stop and pull into a driveway to pick up another friend and for the first time in my life I tell him I don’t trust his driving, he drives too quick, he’s scaring me and I don’t want to ride in the car because I don’t want to die.

I think gosh, she’s always playing the victim. Then I’m in a house - it’s close by my childhood home. There’s a man living in it who’s apparently my significant other, but it doesn’t feel that way. He has longer dark brown hair and a long beard. He smells like patchouli and looks like a typical hippie selling sort of drugs or something. People are coming in and out. There’s an ocean behind us and I can feel the waves crashing. I want to be near the ocean, but he is putting on some sort of fair and he’s offering all his pickled goods for people to eat. I’m helping him serve them, trying to find his mustard that he made. It all seems so strange, I have no idea why I’m there.

I’m in it and in the gift shop, but the upper level where they keep all the things for the witches, they say. I’m pulling out these drawers that remind me of the file card drawers from libraries.

I look at them and I look ahead of me where there’s forest and I look back at them and I think why would I start for you at all? It’s a small street, I’m going really slow, you can wait until I go by. I look in my rearview mirror and see there are cars that have stopped for them and I can see that they can walk behind my car and through the gap and all I can think is: what kind of entitlement is this? And does it even matter? And please get out of my life. And the dream ends.",Rose,last_nights_dream
61,1289,,11/01/2020,01/11/2020 00:06,"“The Cash” I’m in a town and I’m in a house that has maybe 5 or 6 people in it. They’re doing various things. None of them are anyone that I recognize from real life. The dream starts and I’m talking to them about a repair that I need for my car. I describe the way that it’s driving, the way the car is responding. I tell them that the gas pedal feels kind of sticky when I press it down. Underneath the car I can feel some things clunking around when I drive, so I know there’s something wrong with it. It might be the universal. The brakes have a funny feel when I press on them, although they’re not making any sound, so I’m suspecting that it’s the bearings. I know that this is going to cost a lot of money and I don’t have that much money yet. I’m also concerned that the mechanics are going to take advantage of me because I don’t know them and this town is unfamiliar to me. So, the people that I’m telling this to kind of carry on with the mundane tasks that they're completing around the house. I’m sitting at the kitchen table. They’ve wandered off now and I’m by myself at the table. I close my eyes a little bit because I’m sensing another presence there that I can’t see. I realize that Omar is telling me what’s wrong with my car. He’s giving me the exact words to use to describe it when I go into the mechanic. So I get up and leave. I get in the car, drive it up the street to the mechanic’s and I tell them exactly what’s wrong with the fuel system, using the words that he gave me. So the mechanics fix it. They do what I tell them is wrong with it. They don’t do a whole bunch of extra things. It turns out what I thought was wrong with my car would have been unnecessary. Instead of it costing about $3,000, it ends up costing much less. I’ve got a couple thousand left as cash because I had cash for this in my pocket. So I go back to the house and I tell them, “Yay, I got my car fixed! I have this much leftover cash.” And they’re saying, “Oh wow, that’s fantastic.” And I said, “yeah, the mechanics, they were pretty good. I knew what was wrong so I only did what I told them. Bu tI didn’t sense that they were going to take advantage of me - maybe because I told them exactly what to do.” So I’m giving them a recommendation for that shop, but some caveats to still be careful. As I’m doing this, Mike comes into the house. Mike is Omar’s younger brother in real life. In the dream I haven’t seen him in a long time and I run up and give him a big hug. I ask him how he’s doing. I notice that he still carries this sadness with him. I am just feeling for him because he misses his brother. We do a little bit of a catch up sitting at the table. I tell him that I’ve just come back from the mechanics and I fixed my car. He says, “Oh, what was wrong with it?” And he would know exactly what was wrong and what to do with it, too. Both Omar and Mike were very handy as was their dad. They both fixed their own vehicles and built houses and stuff. So I’m cautious as Mike asks me what’s wrong with it. So I tell him exactly. And he says, “Oh? How did you know to say that?” because he knows even though I’m intuitive with my vehicles, he knows I don’t know the exact language to call the parts. And he’s looking at me. And I’m not going to lie to him. Right at the moment, what I’m thinking is that I don’t want to make him feel more upset by suddenly starting to talk about Omar and the fact that I still talk to him even though he’s dead. So I hesitate and that thought is running through my mind. Suddenly at that moment in the dream, the house that we’re in shifts and changes and we’re sitting in his mom’s actual house on the couch in the living room. There’s a picture of Omar on the end table. I’ve got my one arm around the back of Mike’s shoulders soothing him. I’m looking at the photo of Omar, though. Mike says, “Omar told you, didn’t he?” and I said, “Yes, he did.” And then I say to him: “are you okay?” And he puts his head down and it’s like he’s fighting back tears. And I give him a hug. But because I was looking at the photo of Omar, the dream reconstructs again. Now Mike and his mom’s house are gone. We’re in my car - the same car from the beginning of the dream, which actually I never really had a car like that in real life. But we’re in it. Omar’s at the wheel and he’s test driving it to make sure the mechanics did a proper job. He’s tapping the gas pedal and he’s saying, “hmm well this is good.” I excitedly tell him from the passenger side, “yeah and look how much cash I’ve got left over.” He laughs. He’s like, “What are you going to do with all that extra cash?” And I know what I’m going to do with it, but I haven’t told anyone. So we’re driving down the main street of the town we grew up in (the actual town) - it’s called Kent Street. I tell him to turn right on to Colburn, so we’re driving down Colburn for a block and now it’s the year it would be now. I’m pointing out how much things have changed since we used to live there. I’m saying, “Look, there’s an ice cream store over there. That’s new. There’s that old hotel. Ugh, it looks just as horrible as it ever did. Oh, there’s the furniture store on the left. I see that hasn’t changed.” Then we get to Russell Street and I tell him to turn left, so he does. Then we get to the street that the pizza place was on. I tell him to turn left again. He says, “What are we doing? Now we’re back on Kent St.” And I say, “Yeah! Cross the street and park in front of that store.” He looks at me and we’re at the front of the guitar store, which is a new store that I’ve created for my dream. The people who used to own the music store where we used to go are there. He says, “What are we doing here?” And I say, “You’ve never been able to afford a really good guitar and I’ve got all this extra money. Everything else is paid for.” I give it to him and I say, “Go buy a guitar. Just do it!” He’s like, “Yes!” So we go into the store and we’re looking at all the guitars hanging from the racks. He pulls out a few and starts looking at them, playing with them. The store owner comes over and he says, “Oh what one are you interested in?” Omar tells him the one he likes. And he says, “Well, none of these really have all of those characteristics. The fretboard on this one is what you like, but it doesn’t have the pickup and it’s not going to sound as accurate. But, how much money do you have because we could have the technicians put one together for you here right on site.” So Omar tells him that he only has $1,100. I say, “What are you doing? You also have the $1,600 that I gave you.” (this is bad math) But in the dream it almost adds up to $3,000, no $3,300. You could get the guitar - you could get them to build one for you. And he says, “Are you sure?” And I say, “Yes!” And he says, “Done!” So, he talks to the store owner who takes us down to where the technicians are. So we go into the back of the store, down one flight of stairs - they’re really nice stairs, creaky like wooden stairs in an older store and I start to smell beeswax that’s been rubbed into wood. I recognize the honey in the cherrywood and the maple and I can just smell all these different woods and I love that smell of craftsmanship. We get down to the bottom of the 8 steps we climb down, creak creak. Omar engaged in conversation with the store owner and there’s about 4 technicians sitting on stools at their wooden work benches built into the wall. There’s all kinds of drawers. Some have diodes. There’s needle nose pliers and guitar strings and it’s just amazing, this hive of activity and creativity. One of them is standing at an island in the middle and I look at what he’s doing. It looks like he’s making chocolate chip cookies. He’s got the dough rolled out and there’s tiny muffin tins - like mini muffin tins on the work table in front of him. So I get distracted by this and think, “What the hell?!” I walk up and I’m about to ask why he is making chocolate chip cookies when I notice they’re not even chocolate chips. They’re mashed potato with small bits of beef in them that look like the chocolate chips. And I’m thinking, oh my god, that’s gross, but I’m fascinated that he’s making these look like cookies. And then I also realize that I almost get sucked into my curiosity with this and was about to engage with the technician with that question: “What are you doing that for?” and also compliment him on that skill when I realize Omar is looking back, like are you coming. So I nod yes and I start to walk away from him, but they’ve already gone out of that room and I know they’re going down a hall and there’s another room opposite the hallway to this one and I look and my ex-husband Errant is kneeling in there pretending to work on something. He knows nothing about guitars. There’s no tools in front of him and no table. He’s faking working. I realize that he’s eavesdropping, he’s spying on us on the dream from the basement of the guitar store and I am simultaneously horrified and shocked, and I’m like, “What the hell are you doing in my dream?! You’ve never been in any of my dreams before except that one called The Wall.” He starts telling me that he’s there for a repair of the foundation of the house and I know from his description that he knows nothing about the foundation. It’s bullshit what he’s telling me, so I cut him off because I realize Omar and the technician have gone around the corner and I don’t want to lose them and I certainly don’t want to engage in conversation with Errant. So I just cut him off and say I have to go. I walk around the next corner to go into the next room, of which Omar and the technician have already been for about 5 minutes. Omar is now sitting at a table - it’s like a cafe table. The technician has given him a beer while he waits for the guitar to be put together. He’s given him something to make him feel comfortable: sit down here and drink this while you wait. Errant follows me into the room. Omar looks at me, like “Who’s that?” Well they never actually met each other because Omar was already dead when I met Errant. And so I say, “This is Errant, my ex-husband.” And I say, “This is Omar.” As Omar starts to get up out of his seat and reaches his arm out to shake Omar’s hand, I realize that there’s this energy signature going back and forth. His whole being radiates with this charisma and laid back confidence. He vibrates. And Errant senses this and shrinks a little bit into this scared little boy energy. All in that same moment, I realize that Errant’s going to be mad about this and he’s going to pound it out into me because he’s not as charismatic as Omar. Suddenly I’m like I can’t let them shake hands. I must stop this. I don’t want that handshake to join. Errant says, “I’m really sorry to hear about your dad,” as though he knows Omar’s dad passed away. Maybe I told him that when we were married because I used to own a house with Omar and his dad and these two other people - we fixed it up and made it into rental units. I think, “For fucks sake! He knows that and he’s trying to engage Omar in this fake meaningful small talk, just so he can spend more time here. He’s inserting himself here and of course, Omar’s like, “Oh thanks very much.” He looks at the beer and he looks at me and I think, “Oh he wants us to get 2 more drinks - one for me and one for Errant, so the three of us can sit down here and have some kind of conversation.” I start to feel really agitated and I feel like I’m retraumatized again from how Errant treated me in our marriage. I can feel my heart start to race up into my throat and I think there’s no way this is going to happen. So I look at Omar and make my eyes really big and I start to stand up a bit and I use the names of beer labels to suddenly create the first verse of a song out of beer names, but they appear to be beer names, but really I’m telling him a story like: This is my ex-husband, he’s a jerk, don’t make me sit there with him. He gets it. And just before they shake hands, he sits back down. By this time I’m still so agitated I can’t calm myself down in the dream. I’m feeling both threatened that Errant’s presence is going to somehow make Omar go away, especially if I leave the room to go get drinks for everyone. He will start telling him lies. I feel this burning in my chest. And then I’m transitioning to a waking state where I can feel hot tears behind my eyes and they start to spill down my face. I’m simultaneously wanting to go back into the dream because I know Omar will make Errant go away - he won’t force me to sit there and engage in small conversation. But at the same time I’m scared to go back into a place where Errant might be. I pause in this liminal space for 5-10 minutes and then I just turned on the light and started recording this.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

65,1087,,12/01/2020,01/12/2020 00:03,"I am in a school, parts of it look like my old high school and the people I’m with feel like my old classmates. I’m teaching and it feels like what I’m teaching is very basic - it’s stuff that most people already know, although my classmates don’t seem to know it. I leave the classroom that I’m in and head outside. There’s a bunch of kids - they’re younger than me and they’re not particularly friendly. It’s definitely a clique and I’m just watching them. They’re showing off and I don’t really feel welcome, so I leave and head to this classroom where another young woman is teaching and I love what she’s teaching. It’s all new and I’ve never run into it before, but it makes perfect sense and it’s a type of sociology about the way humans interact and how we communicate and can have adult mature conversations. The kids in this clique are in there, kind of, but they’re acting like they’ve heard all of it even though it’s all new to me. I’m just noticing the difference between my classmates who I was teaching who are older and these younger kids who seem to already know a lot and are very aloof. I sit down and have a conversation with the teacher who is maybe a little bit younger than me but not by much. She tells me about this raincoat or jacket (I forget the name she called it), but she’s showing me this things she’s wearing and it looks like a snakeskin where she cut a slit through the side of the body and can fit her head into when she puts it on it actually expands out and her arms go - one side goes down into the tail and the other side goes down into the head and expands and lifts up and out. It covers her like a cape, but when she takes it off it goes back into its snakeskin size and she just curls it up and puts it in her bag. I’m totally fascinated and she very much loves it and likes talking about it. She says it’s a lot like the capes that the Scots used to wear. I don’t know what that means. I take her word for it. And then it’s time for us to leave this classroom. We’re going to a competition of sorts. She and these standoffish kids and me and some of my friends who are going to be performing, we get in the back of a truck/wagon and we’re on our way. The standoffish kids are down at the bottom and even though it’s a celebration, they are not drinking any alcohol. The friends around me, they have all of their instruments and supplies, and they keep talking about the alcohol they’re going to drink, and I don’t want to. I think, no, we don’t want to drink, it makes us poor players, it makes us so we can’t compete very well. We won’t win. One of them starts to pass around a bottle of champagne and I say I don’t want it. I stick a cork in it, but the cork won’t stay - the fizzies keep popping it off. Somebody else comes in and says, “oh there’s a way to make a cork that will stay but you have to know the magic.” But he doesn’t seem to know it. I don’t like it anyway. I just keep thinking that if they start drinking, we won’t be able to compete and those other kids will win the competition. It seems so off to me that alcohol is still available anyway. We arrive at the carnival/festival/competition place we were heading to. There’s a big outdoor tent. It’s kind of dark and gloomy throughout this whole dream - not a lot of sunshine. The younger kids go off and set up their project or their music or whatever it is. Me and my companions also set up our space. What I notice is there’s not a lot of help getting it set up. I can tell I’m doing a lot of work. We have some sort of booth and people are coming by. We are explaining to the judges what our booth represents - what all the things we’ve set up are for. There’s this feeling that is not quite up to snuff or up to par - it’s not what’s needed right now. Whatever it is that we’re showing or doing is 2 or 3 steps behind whatever those kids are setting up or doing - just like in the school where they seemed 2 or 3 steps ahead in their courses already even though I was a teacher that was teaching to my peers. The fair thing is over now and it’s time to clean up and clear off the table. All of my friends leave and leave me to do the cleaning up for myself. I’m distraught because I’m supposed to go with those younger kids wherever they’re going. That teacher is with them and she’s beckoning me to come with, but I don’t go because if I don’t clean up, nobody else will and I’m the only one who knows where everything goes anyway.",Rose,last_nights_dream
66,1290,,12/01/2020,01/12/2020 00:04,"“The Feedback Centre” In this dream I am in a conference center, but it’s not like a square room with a whole bunch of chairs lined up in rows and then there’s a raised stage with a podium or anything like that. It’s more like where you would go see a movie because there’s one wall where you take a number and you sit in some chairs like when you go get your driver’s license. So you’re sitting there and there’s a whole bunch of different windows. And you wait there until your number’s called and you go up to one window and receive your feedback. Then you’re allowed to take your feedback to tables that are set up more like round tables, some are rectangular and long though, they are different shapes. You can order food and you can meet people, you can talk to other people. It’s full of people. The atmosphere is very loud - it’s almost like there’s music going on, like satellite music being pumped in. There’s no point where anything is silent. It’s busy. It’s moving fast. There’s a service staff there that’s bringing people food and alcohol. And I’m finding that it’s overwhelming. I’m overstimulated. I don’t really want to be there anyway. I took a bus to get there. I left my peaceful quiet home to get on this bus to go get feedback which I’m a little excited to see, but I’m also dreading some because with feedback there’s always some that seems to be laced with people’s jealousies, base emotions. People that give feedback don’t really understand what the program was. As well as positive feedback. So it’s with mixed emotions that arrive at this place, the Feedback Centre, to receive my feedback. It’s not clear on what program I’m teaching or participating in. Some of the feedback is just on conversations that you’ve had with people or things that you’ve said. So it’s vast and at the same time really specific. So I line up. I’ve got my number in my hand and wait until I’m called. I’m chatting with other people - just mindless talk, it’s small talk. I receive my feedback. I’ve got it in my hands and there’s a whole bunch of different papers. It’s like the things people would fold up and put in a feedback box, so when you empty the box out, there’s all these small folded up pieces of paper. I have them in my hand. I’m looking around to see if there’s anyone I know at these tables so I can sit down and sort through this and I do. I see a group of friends that I know (I know them in real life as well) - they used to be my neighbors and I still see them, sometimes we go out dancing together. So I go and sit with them. Some of them have already ordered food. Some of them have already ordered a drink. I realize that they are not even there to get feedback. They’re there to just participate in a dinner out together, so they’re celebrating someone’s birthday. But that’s okay. They see me and they wave, “Hey Freya” and I go sit with them. I start looking through my feedback. One of them asks me if I’m going to get something to eat or drink. I say no, I’m going to be going soon. I’m sorting through my feedback pile, opening up all the papers, flattening them out, setting them in a pile. A server comes over and asks me if I‘m going to get anything. What am I going to order, she says. I tell her I’m not going to stay very long. She says, “Well you have to order something in order to sit at this table.” So I say, “Okay then please feel free to set a menu down here.” So I start looking through the feedback and in my dream I’m not reading any of it. It’s like the words aren’t even in English, they're just like blah blah blah, until I get to one that says, “Your feedback is too ripe.” And the “too ripe” is in quotation marks. And I think, “My feedback? What have I even given feedback on?” And I’m trying to scroll through my mind and think what I’ve done in the last year where I’m providing feedback to others. And I see it’s signed by Oake, and I realize it’s Oake from my Priestess School. So while I’m sitting there thinking what she could mean by that and what does too ripe mean, the server comes by and I order a salad and a cider. She goes away. And then one of the neighbors starts talking to me and she’s describing her vacation and asking me if I’m going to go on one. She says she’s single and would I come on one with her and I’ll be her roommate. She starts describing its attributes and stuff, so I’m a little distracted from my feedback pile but I’m enjoying the conversation and actually considering going on the vacation with her. So I leave my pile of feedback notes and she grabs me by the hand and takes me over to this other table. They have brochures for sunny vacations and she’s all excited and animated about it and she’s telling me some of the ones she’s been to or where she wants to go. Suddenly there’s a portal in that table and it opens up and we’re at a pool. I’m in a bathing suit. So is she. We dive down into the swimming pool and swim more than a couple of lengths - enough swimming so that I look at her and say, “Okay i can’t swim anymore!” And she says, “Alright let’s get out.” So we get out and dry ourselves off. We put our towels around our waist and go up and look. There’s a freezer full of M&M’s food - it’s premade food you can order, all in cardboard boxes - they have stores with just a sea of cardboard boxes of premade food. It’s disgusting and I don’t want any. She’s pulling out all different kinds of boxes and getting really excited about her purchases and by this time I really don’t want to participate in that. I’m trying to think of how to get out of it politely without offending her. So I just tell her I’ll carry her boxes for her and I do. Here we are in bare feet now with towels wrapped around our waists, in bathing suits, walking up a street and getting on a bus, going to her house, dropping them off. She stays there and now I’m standing there and I feel slightly out of place and uncomfortable in my bathing suit with no shoes on. I can feel the grit of the road and the sidewalk and the dirt from the floor of the bus. I get back on there with my towel wrapped around my waist, go back to the Feedback Centre, walk in and now I don’t know where my actual clothes are because they’re in this portal from the table with the vacation brochures. I go back to my table. My friends are now eating dessert. My salad and cider seem to have disappeared. I pick up my feedback stacks and I look at them and I feel some kind of umbrage that after all of the stuff that I’ve done for Oake for her school to help her that her feedback for me is that mine is too ripe. As I sit with this, I realize that I have given feedback to her school that she took and was appreciative of it at the time and actually followed through on some of it and it improved her situation. And I’m thinking, “Wow, and now you’re telling me in this not directly to my face way that it’s too ripe.” I realize that she means it’s too blunt, it’s too straightforward, she wants it to be softer and padded with flowery poetic language and stuff so that it doesn’t cut through to the chaste so well. The last part of the dream is the person who is celebrating the birthday that all these neighbors are there for, I realize I don’t have a gift and everybody else has given him something. I feel obligated to do so, so I go out to the parking lot and my daughter or my nephew is there and I tell him/her this and they give me a bag of caramel corn to give to this guy and a birthday bag to put it in. So I go walking back in with the bag of caramel corn. I find him. I’m feeling kind of ashamed of the gift because he’s getting purchased things and gadgets and stuff. I walk over and give him the bag and say, “Kiss on a cheek. Happy Birthday. Sorry, I didn’t realize it was your birthday when I came here.” He takes the gift and says thank you. I turn around and walk away, take my feedback things from the table, deposit them in the used bin, so it checks off my name that I’ve had it. I turn around and see that he’s put all the gadgety gifts and everybody is excitedly digging into the bag of caramel corn. So instead of being a 3x6 inch one, it’s now this giant back of carmel corn and they’re all like,” Woohoo! Caramel Corn! This is the best gift ever.”",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

It was a housing development all alone in the high plains. It had snowed recently. I walked past a house that had been for rent but there were big burned wooden beams inside - someone told me it had burned down. I went to my house but the dogs were not there so I went to pick them up from my ex’s house. He was not there but there was a guy who called on the phone saying he was looking for him. Then he called me and asked me to get him to work on getting the Christmas tree put away. Then some workers came and tried to move it and it broke. He yelled and it made one of the workers cry so I hugged him.,Vera,last_nights_dream2

75,1292,,13/01/2020,01/13/2020 00:07,"“Tea” I was in a greenhouse. I was planting and growing things that I would eat. There’s other people there doing the same thing, but they’re “greenhouse mates” - we’re not friends, they’re just there and we’re part of the greenhouse community. I occasionally speak to them. I ask them if they’ve ever tried growing this. One of them will comment that yes they have with success, or no they haven’t ever tried that, or they tried it without success. I’m growing an amazingly different number of lettuces and cabbages which look distinctly different from each other. I’ve never seen any other than two strains of cabbage in my waking life. But there’s all kinds of cabbage, some of it is beyond frilly to the point of being downright hairy, but they’re not hairs, they’re actually long and skinny cabbage fibers that grow from the head of the cabbage and you would cut off and eat. This appears to be one of my favorite ones because I’m growing a lot of it. In waking life I don’t eat wheat or gluten. So I’m growing this gluten free bread. You put the seeds in a bowl and it rises and turns into a bread, but it’s really made of vegetable fibers. So in the dream, there’s lots of me growing food and it’s a nice dream. Inside the greenhouse there’s the right amount of moisture. It’s a bit messy, but it’s nice. There’s hydroponics and actual seeds and dirt. Then as I begin to harvest some of the seeds I’ve been growing and put them in containers and compartments, the dream deconstructs into a townhouse that I actually used to live in, in a place called Wellington Square. I’m making tea. So I’m making it out of the things I’ve grown. I’m making apple tea out of apple leaves and actual apples. I pour it into the pot and the water is just the right temperature. I wait and let it steep. I remember it tasted really good, too. There was cinnamon in it. Then I decide to get out my grandmother’s fine china tea sets. I pour from the pot into the tea cups and sit for a minute and think, “Why haven’t I used these before? Tea really does taste better in it.” I’m sitting sipping my tea and I realize that it was my uncle’s birthday the next day and I invite him. This is the end of January in my dream. My logical mind says to me, this isn’t his actual birthday because it’s not. I’ve never had a dream where my uncle was in it. He’s my biological mother’s brother. He’s not mean or anything, but he’s not a super nice person. He’s childish and selfish like she is, but I decide to invite him over for his birthday and I make this cake out of my gluten free flour that I’ve grown in the greenhouse. I ice it and make the apple tea. It’s ready in the pot with my grandmother’s tea cups. When he comes to the door, he’s got these two other people with him - they’re both male - he hasn’t asked if he could invite them, he’s never been to my house before, we aren’t that close and I’m thinking, “Well, you’ve got a lot of nerve just showing up with two extra people.” However, I give them tea and cake and invite them to sit down. They eat their cake. They comment that it’s good, but what’s it made of, we’ve never had cake like this before. So I tell them that it’s gluten free and from the greenhouse. Then they comment on the tea in the teacups and say they would rather have it out of a mug. And they drink their tea and ask me to make more but they want it in a mug. So I collect their teacups from them and I say, “no, it’s time for you to go.” So they leave with me coaxing them: “Time to go. Out you go. Here’s your coat. Here’s your boots.” I open the door. They’re kind of looking at me oddly, but they leave and I close the door behind them. And that’s it. Then there’s another person in my house. I invited her and it’s Janet and her boyfriend. Her phone starts ringing and she ignores it because she’s in my living room having tea and talking. So I put it in her purse and close the zipper because now there’s dirty dishes and teacups lying around and I don’t want anything to spill on her phone. Everybody else finishes their tea. My Uncle comes into the kitchen and he starts talking to me. He tells me that he’s not happy with the business that he has and since he’s only in his late fifties that he’s going to explore other options for a career. One of the things that he’d like to do is to work in a greenhouse. I’m thinking, well that’s interesting. I say to him, “Are you serious? You’re only in your late fifties.” I’m in a bit of a shock that he’s saying this to me because I know it’s a lie - I know that he’s a lot older than that and I think, “You know, you’ve never shown any interest in greenhouses. Why are you telling me this?” So I’m suspicious of his conversation, though I’m also appreciative that he’s choosing to do something he would enjoy instead of something that he doesn’t like. And then he tells me that he’ll see me next year at the same time on his birthday. And I say, “Yup, just like every other year when I’ve always made you something.” He looks at me with surprise as though he doesn’t remember that I have every year invited him over and made him a cake and offered him tea. Then he does leave. Janet and her boyfriend come into the kitchen. She notices that her phone is not where she left it. I tell her I put it in her purse. They leave and then I wash all the dishes and put away my grandmother’s teacups. I’m thinking of them fondly and put them back in the cupboard.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream2

We got there and I stepped foot on the trail only to realize that I had left my glasses behind. It was a full day's drive and I was trying to decide whether I needed them or not. I was debating between hiking a few days without them and having my mom return with them at a gap or whether I would return with her to get them.  I remember seeing the car ride out to the trail from the 3rd person perspective. It was daytime and the pavement had clearly been paved recently. I could see it winding in figure-8 like patterns.

81,1088,,14/01/2020,01/14/2020 00:02,"I’m in a condo - it’s huge. There’s a huge kitchen. The living room is gigantic. The bathroom has two separate showers. There’s a balcony that I walk out onto and can see the ocean from it. I live in this condo with my kids. They’re not here with me right now, but I feel comfortable here. All of my stuff is in the condo. Now my ex is here with me and we’re being cordial with each other. He’s actually even really friendly and seems happy to see me. I notice he has some of his stuff with him and it bothers me that he’s brought it and put it into the condo. This condo is one that I received in the divorce and yet somehow he is able to buy it and take it for himself. I’m not clear on why he’s even there, except that all of a sudden, I can feel that his energy is moving into this place with me. I decide to go take a shower and he decides he’ll go take a shower, too. I don’t want him anywhere near me and I don’t want him to see me naked. I go to take a shower and his desk and other office stuff is in the shower stall so I can’t get in. I’m really mad because I did not say okay - I did not say it was alright for him to move his stuff in there and to be in this place. I’m starting to get agitated and his demeanor is changing from one of kindness and being happy to see me to really domineering. I ask him to take his stuff out of the shower, but it’s taking him forever, so I just decide not to and I leave. Then I say, “You know we have to have the conversation because this isn’t what I want and this isn’t true and this isn’t going to last. Now he gets really shut down. We actually walk out of the condo into a lobby type area that’s part of the complex. There’s a huge Christmas tree in the lobby area. We can see out to the ocean from where we’re standing. I tell him I don’t want him living with me or in my space and that he needs to leave. But he tells me that he owns the condo and it is his now and that I can’t stay there. We go back up to the condo and I’m racking my brain because I don’t have any place to go. I don’t know where I’m going to go and I don’t have any money. I don’t know where I’m going to live where the kids can be with me. I start to pack up all my stuff and as I’m doing so, his girlfriend comes in. We sit down at the table in the kitchen. It’s an oval table with a couple of leaves in it. The chairs don’t match. In fact one of the chairs is a lot shorter. It kind of makes me laugh, but I don’t sit in that one. He tells me that he now owns the condo, that it’s his place and he’s going to share it with the girlfriend. I ask him how much he pays every month and he says they split the $5,000 monthly mortgage. I know that is not something I can pay. I see that the kids - her kids and our kids - are there and they’re running around. They’re happy to be in this space. I know I’m not going to live there with them. So I gather as much of my things as I can and I leave. I don’t know exactly what I’m going to do. I know the kids are okay for now, so that’s alright. As I walk out the front door, he walks with me and he’s essentially escorting me out and off the properties. We’re walking through this neighborhood that looks really familiar and I realize I’ve been in this neighborhood before. Down at the end of the neighborhood is a crystal mine. I’ve been to this crystal mine before and I can’t remember when or why, I just remember there’s crystals there. We walk by a house whose roof is being replaced. The woman who owns the house is on top of it and the roof is being replaced with large large tumbled crystals. They are huge stones and she’s sliding them into these lanes that fit on top of her roof. She’s about an eighth of the way done. I watch as she climbs down the ladder. She has these special shoes on and walks out to the crystal mine. My ex and I are still walking and we start to follow her. But I want him to leave because there’s no reason for him to be near me.

82,1293,,14/01/2020,01/14/2020 00:03,"“The Attacks” My dream last night was a nightmare. It starts in the town where I grew up. I’m in front of the house that I lived in when I was growing up. I’m sitting on the grass in the front lawn and I see a person but it’s not clearly identified features. I’m just somehow in my dream saying it’s a man. The man is running and shouting angrily. I feel threatened so I start to back up. The person runs into my neighbor’s house on the right. I can’t go in my own house because I'm not safe there so I sneak around the side of my house and am hiding in the backyard. I hear screaming and yelling and commotion. The man comes out of my neighbor’s house and starts coming back up towards my house and goes in - nothing happens because no one’s in there - and comes out. I realize that he is sneaking or stalking around the perimeter of my own house. So I avoid him but he’s not far behind and I don’t know where to go that’s safe. I notice that my other neighbor’s side door is open a little bit and I’m feeling kind of bad about going into the house without knocking, but if I don’t run in and close the door and lock it, then that thing will get me. So I run in, close the door and lock it and the lady that owns the house looks at me and says, “Oh! What are you doing in here?” I say, “Quick! Lock the front door! There’s an angry person!” (but I don’t call it that in the dream. I’ve given it a name and the name escapes me). I warn her, so she does and we listen and it’s yelling angrily and pounding at the door and trying to get in, but it doesn’t. But while it’s trying, I tell her that it’s been chasing me for ages and I’m really sorry for invading your privacy, but I needed to come in here or it would kill me. She says that’s okay, it’s alright. She calmly looks at me and says, “Freya, what have you been doing? I never see you anymore.” So she’s talking to me and she’s kind of oblivious that this thing is out there. And then our small talk finishes. It’s quiet. It’s been quiet. I hover by the inside of her side door, waiting and waiting. I finally decide to open the door a crack, take a peek out, look around, there’s nothing. So I decide to leave and I go out of her house. I start walking up the street. Just as I get part way up, there it is again! It’s chasing me again, so I’m running and I can feel my breath getting caught in my throat and I’m getting out of breath and my legs start to hurt but I keep running and running and running. All of a sudden, that town turns into the town where I currently live. I’m coming towards the main street and I don’t know where to go because it’s dark out, nothing’s open, I don’t know anyone there. Then I realize that my friend lives about a block away and I might be able to make it to his house. So I do. This thing is behind me! I can hear it and it’s like just almost within a grasp of me the whole time. I make it to my friend’s apartment building and again I’m feeling the same kind of thing as I did in my neighbor’s house where I don’t feel right about barging in without knocking or without asking if it’s okay to come over or any of those things you do before you go over to someone else’s house. His door is slightly ajar and I run in, close the door and do up all the locks. I’m standing there and I can hear this thing on the outside, and it’s like snuffling around almost animal-like. I can feel its fingers tracing the outline of the door, looking for some way to come in. I back away really really slowly. I see my friend lying on the couch in his living room. He’s resigin. He’s having a nap. So I quietly sneak down into one of the bedrooms. I sit there. Some time passes and I’m listening for this thing and now I can hear it outside the apartment building trying to find a different way in. I don’t look out the window because I’m afraid it will see me. And then my friend wakes up and he’s over by the bedroom door, and I’m like shh with my finger over my mouth. I indicate to go to the middle of the apartment. The kitchen is actually in the middle. We go over there and I tell him, “I hope you don’t mind me coming in. There’s this thing chasing me and everywhere I go, it manages to break in the door or smash a window.” He says, “Oh, that’s okay.” So he tells me to just make myself comfortable and I do. He, my friend, goes about his regular tasks. He’s putting his things in his case and collecting up textbooks and he’s packing his lunch. He gets dressed and I’m still sitting there waiting and waiting. I’m nervous that he’s going to open the door and that thing will get in and find me. But he tells me to lock the door behind him, he opens the door, there’s nothing there. He goes to work and then I lock the doors behind him. So now I’m sitting in his apartment. I don’t have any of my own stuff. There’s not really anything to do. So I go in and wash the dishes because there’s nothing else to do. Then I’m sitting in the living room staring at the walls, feeling slightly trapped. I’m not calm. I can feel how tense and wired my body is. Then I sense that there’s somebody in one of the back bedrooms. So I go in there and my daughter’s in there and I’m like, “Oh! You’re here!” Then I notice that my cats have appeared - they are in the apartment too. I go into the other room and there’s my son. So now everybody’s in here and they’re safe. Okay, this is a good thing. Now, what are we going to do about food and clothing. I go over to one of the dressars and suddenly there’s clothing for us in one of the dressars. I go out to the kitchen and there’s no shortage of food - why would there be, somebody lives there. So I prepare my kids something to eat. I’m warning them, though, not to make too much noise or turn on many lights because that thing might get us. Then the day passes. We have some idle chit chat, patting the cats, and just kind of mindlessly arranging the furniture so we’ll fit in there - just slightly small. And then my friend comes back home from work and he’s just in there. I don’t actually see him come in the door, so there’s no fear about the door - that’s not revisited. He’s just in there again and I still feel tense that now we’re wearing different clothes and we’ve made food and now my cats and my kids are in there. And I’m scared because this is a huge invasion of his privacy. I don’t know where his dog went - he actually has a dog that would be some concern with the cats, but the dog doesn’t seem to be there. He’s a single dad and his two kids - the one son just comes and goes freely and the daughter is two weeks on, two weeks off. So I'm tense about this and he says, no that’s fine, don’t worry about it, and he says, come here, and he gives me a big hug and says, lie down. And he’s just hugging me. I can feel myself start to relax. I feel the tension slide away from my body. I accept that I’m safe. It happens gradually - as this hug is happening, a day passes and a night passes and a day passes and a night passes, and then I accept that okay, this is the right place to hide and it’s okay. My daughter has started to come and go freely. My son hasn’t. My friend’s kids are in their own routine and they get along fine. My son has taken an interest in his daughter - she is unique - and my son is very nurturing. The two of them have formed some kind of bond and that doesn’t surprise me because my son loves younger kids. So some semblance of normalcy has formed in my environment. I still want to go home, but I know I can’t and for now, this is working fine and people are happy.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

We share this backyard with neighbors that live in the house behind us. So I decide to go over and see if I can find one of the neighbors. One of them is a guy in his late twenties. He’s sitting in a makeshift house, like a playhouse for kids, really simple with just cutouts for doors and windows and nothing else really. He’s sitting inside with his didgeridoo and his flute and he says yeah, the dog had a stomach upset and has been shitting all day, but he doesn’t volunteer to help clean up. I don’t recall how I respond, but I end up leaving and walking back to the house. As I do this, I step in a pile of liquidy dog poop. I don’t have any shoes on and I can feel that liquidy shit on the sole of my left foot. Then I see that somebody has pushed the blanket together towards the middle but the poop is still there in the center, so that has to be taken care of. I walk back inside.

They are young men, probably in their twenties. They’ve been reformed themselves and have grown up in this system. They’re there to separate out the children and choose the ones who will be reformed. They separate them into red groups and orange groups. I think that it would be best for them to choose the ones who are already complacent and will go along with everything. But I notice that the young men are ones that I recognize from earlier in my life - I saw them at Esalen and they were really carefree spirits. So the children that they are not the complacent quiet well behaved ones, but of course the ones that are the most wild, free and expressive - the ones that have a sense of themselves from the very beginning, kind of like my son...

I just want to get away from him because it feels like he keeps trying to mark his territory and take and control and dominate. I’m just tired of it. I walk out into the living room and I see that my godmother is standing there and my auntie. I explain to her that I’m tired of all of this. The kitchen is behind her and the refrigerator is there and an old piece of furniture that we used to have in my childhood home that was a bar is in between the two of us. I’m noticing that. Time has gone backwards. I’m now in a younger version of the house that I grew up in. I’m still a mother. I still have two children. They’re still with me. And my godmother says let’s just go. All of a sudden we’re in a car all together, but my ex is there, too, and I just do not want him there. We are driving down the road and I’m starting to get upset because I realize we didn’t pack anything. There’s no food. There’s no water. I don’t have my phone, my wallet, my keys. I don’t have anything. I turn to my godmother and I tell her we need to go back so that we can get some supplies. She asks me if I’m sure. I say, “yes, we don’t have any of the things we need.” She says okay and instead of pulling out into the turnout to the right, she goes a little further down the road to this place where there’s no turnout and where in fact either side of the road is covered in this marshy area. She cranks the wheel of the van that we’re in really hard, taking us partially into these marshy rice paddy type places. She flips the car on its side and uses the momentum to turn us all the way around and then we’re heading back the other way. We’re all fine, there’s nothing wrong with the car. It was just like she was a stunt woman using the extra momentum to turn this car around on the narrowest part of the road possible. We start to head back. But now the scenery around us has changed and she says, “ well, we’re going to take a shortcut.” And she takes the van, and starts driving offroad into these marshy areas that seem to have spots of dry ground where the van makes it through and all of a sudden we are pulled up at this building that looks like a Chinese temple. We get out of the car and all thoughts of the things we need are forgotten. We meet Senator Daniel Inouye from Hawaii. He and his wife and I think one of his children are coming down the steps as we are going up towards the temple. He’s young - he’s much younger - and somehow he recognizes me. I give him the traditional kiss and hug hello. He’s wearing a lei. I introduce my children and somehow my siblings have shown up. His wife somehow recognizes me and gives me a big hug. There’s joy between us. I feel joy at seeing them. Then they leave and continue on their way. We, my godmother and I and my children and the ex who is still hanging around go up the stairs and into this temple and into the restaurant section where all of the Asian food I grew up eating is there to eat. It just smells so good and there’s display cases and a buffet table. I’m walking through the buffet wanting to load up my plate, watching as my godmother loads up her plate and my kids load up their plates. I don’t because I’m allergic to rice and I’m allergic to soy and I can’t eat what is being offered on the tables and in the display cases. I’m heartbroken because number one, I’m starving, and number two, I haven’t had these foods in so so long and I want to eat them and I can’t.",Rose,last_nights_dream

98,1090,,16/01/2020,01/16/2020 00:06,"I’m walking through a neighborhood. The houses are really close together. There’s tons of people out - the people who live there, the kids, all the neighbors and also the people who don’t and are milling about as well. The streets feel narrow and crowded. The atmosphere isn’t necessarily celebratory, but it’s not threatening either. I’m curious about all the houses. They’re so different in the way they’re put together and they’re even facing different directions - not lined up like you would usually see them. And now I’m walking through a little playground/play yard. It’s got the small slides for toddlers and bark chips on the ground. As I move through, I’m invited into someone’s house - a woman and one of her children invite me in and I walk into the house and notice that there are bright colors on all the walls and all of the walls are different color. As I’m walking through, I realize it’s one of the houses I remodeled when I was younger. It’s all the colors I had painted the walls in my house. I look at her and ask how did she come into possession of this house. I thought it was something I still owned or I just hadn’t seen it in such a long time that I almost forgot that it was part of my story. She says that she bought it. It had been a rental for a while and she and her family had bought the house. They renovated it a little - they added to it. So she walked around showing me these renovations like real wood paneling on some of the walls that looked absolutely beautiful. The back of the house had been extended out. She leads us into the backyard. I see that the backyard is actually huge. It has a fence around it and there’s still all the people all around. The neighborhood is so crowded. There’s so many people, but this backyard is this one area where it’s just huge and not a lot of people in it, although there’s a fence to keep the people out. There’s a mother-in-law cottage that they’ve built on it, but it’s only half built. It hasn’t been completed. It’s made of all natural material. Parts of it that are built, I can see it’s old trees and stone. It’s a beautiful small building. We continue to walk past this and we’re walking down the long slope of the grass yard. It ends at water, at the ocean. We go into the ocean. We are swimming in the ocean - me and the woman and some other people I don’t know, they’re just around. We’re swimming out and the waves are getting really really big, but I am not worried because I know how to swim and dive under big waves. So as the first wave comes, I swim out towards it and dive under and it’s a long wave. I’m under for a while before it passes over me and I can come up for another breath of air. I see that there are more waves coming - more big waves. I’m not panicking. I’m not worried. I know exactly how to swim under it, but I think that there are people behind me that are panicking and they are not sure. They don’t know what to do. But I’m somehow showing them what to do. They’re learning by seeing me swim under these really big waves and come back up to the surface. Then the dream ends.",Rose,last_nights_dream
99,1294,,16/01/2020,01/16/2020 00:07,"“The Trek” The setting is in a way that it’s not the orderly kind of linear almost based on Roman architecture grid for cities that we have now - it’s not like that, it’s much different. I don’t think it’s Agrarian either. I get the feeling that it’s again post-apocalyptic, but much further along in the future than the dream when I was standing in a burnt world and started choking and woke up because I was choking. Everyone here, we are wearing ragged bits of eclectic pieces of clothing. There’s no real recognizable city structure. There’s ruined buildings with grass and vegetation growing up, in, around the building. People have settled there and built structures out of other scraps and things. It’s not unpleasant to look at. It has a settled, organized, civilized feel to it. However, there’s agrimony between groups of people who have settled around these places. Part of the group that I am settling with, we know we have to flee or we’re probably going to be killed. So we organize very quickly. We can’t bring all of our stuff. Our stuff is an eclectic variety of things that we use to feed ourselves and clothe ourselves with. Some people have backpacks and these are being dispersed among the group. I’d say there’s probably about 60 or 75 in my group, but for the purpose of traveling and feeding ourselves, we organize ourselves into four groups, so there’s about twelve to fifteen in each group. They are dividing people into groups by skill level, so if you have already shown some survival skill behavior, they don’t put all of those people in one group. They’re separating them so there’s at least one person who’s got some know-how in each group. I’m one of those people who has some survival skills. I’m separated from some of my closer friends because we can’t all travel together and this makes me sad. We also have people in the group who have babies. There’s one woman who’s carrying a baby. They also divide these people up because they drag people down. They can’t hunt and some of them don’t have survival skills - they feel more dependent. We also have got two toddlers in our group and they’re not even clothed. They’re running around naked and we’re trying to find small backpacks they can carry and some clothes that will fit them. They were dividing toddlers up and they’re not even with their parents - I have a feeling that they don’t have parents. They are just random toddlers, so they’re divided up into groups. So we leave separately. All this organizing and scavenging for equipment that we can carry on our backs is done before nightfall. We leave undercover of the dark. We know we cannot follow each other when we’re traveling in all these different groups because that will reduce the chances that we’ll survive. We need to be in smaller groups, so we won’t be spotted. Much of the dream is climbing over landscapes - meadows and cliffs and forests and swampy muddy things where we get completely filthy, but then find a body of water to wash in. There’s some skirmishes within the group where people are hungry and stealing each other’s food, including the toddlers. I have to take extra food away from kids - you know how kids will just randomly run around and graze, they’ll just shove food in their mouths as they’re going - I can’t let them do that. I have to keep them on the rations. So this is one dream memory of me opening up the toddlers hands and opening them up because they’ve got three times more of the berries than they’re supposed to have and I have to disperse these around. Part of me, as I’m doing this, feels regret because the child is so innocent - it’s a natural thing for a child to do and I feel a little sadness. I also feel a little bit of inner frustration that I even have a toddler that I have to do this with when we’re trying so hard to survive. So it’s an honest mixture of feelings that I have when I’m doing this. As we climb over more complicated and go through more dense flora and fauna, there’s a part where I’m aware that the group that is pursuing us and trying to kill us is actually on our trail. I realize they’re getting closer. I see this because I’ve climbed up high. There's an alarm in the middle of the night. I have to wake everybody up and get them to move. Some of them don’t want to and I’m like, pack your backpack! And some people don’t want to carry it, and I’m like if you don’t get up and move we’re going to have to leave you here! So I end up carrying three more packs than I’m supposed to. I end up getting everybody up, but there’s a couple of people that were groggy and wouldn’t wake up, they may be with the group, but I’m not sure and we have to move. Then we are in like the Amazon forest and we rappel up. We make it all the way up. It’s hard. We’re carrying toddlers in packs, passing things out, and we make it up to the top. We are safe now from that group. The landscape is still pretty densely forested. As we realize we’re safe, we’re able to spread out and rest a little bit. It was pretty onerous getting up there like that and so has the whole journey. So we take a couple days to rest. As I’m doing this and we’re setting up a makeshift camp, I realize that one of the other groups is close by and doing a similar thing. I sneak through the underbrush and I was about to make contact and ask the leader if they think it’s safe to join up just for the rest part, I see that my ex best friend is in that group, and now I don’t want to. I don’t want to have any communication with her. I’m glad she’s out of my life. She’s really hurt me and that’s why we’re no longer friends. I don’t want her back in. She’s also narcissistic and I feel much better now that she’s out of my life. But there’s also some sadness with it too - when someone you love and care about betrays you, there’s also some sadness. So I feel this emotion going through my body. By this time, the other leader is aware of our group. Some of the members of their group have spread out far enough so everyone knows that we’re both here. So I end up having to suck it up as we get together with this other group for a meal. There’s people in that group who were friends of mine from before we had to leave our home, so I’m having this pleasant conversation with them. It’s a feeling of camaraderie. I’m aware that my friend knows I’m there. I also feel this thread of self satisfaction that she’s not one of the organizers - she didn’t have survival skills. Her skills were based on what she could suck off of others, so she’s demoted into that part of the social fabric of her group and I will truthfully admit to feeling a smack of satisfaction over that. The dream ends with us folding up our camps and putting them all back in our backpacks. You wouldn’t even know we were there. We’re brushing any vegetation that has been flattened with sticks with leaves on them and we continue on our trek.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

We were part of a secret freedom fighting organization. We had burrowed our way through the school closing doors and blocking off access points behind us to make it difficult for anyone to follow us. Our hope was that we could escape without any further bloodshed.  We could at first hear people following us from around us and above but eventually those noises died down and we thought we were safe.  We did some kind of scanning to figure out where people were as we traveled through the underground tunnels. We came out into a more open area not too far from an exit which would allow us to escape to the surface.  We heard noises or sensed vibrations and when I put my head to the ground I could hear voices below us. The military was tunneling up to attack us. I came up with a plan. We'd either go for the exit or return the way we came, and we'd use printers (not sure how these were relevant) to pour molten lead down onto the military if they tried to surface. The whole time though, I didn't want to do anything to kill. We were only trying to escape and to avoid conflict. I don't believe we were an especially violent group.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

There’s water and electricity on each camp, and huts where they have table tennis and ping pong, a nice shower, the washing machine and dryer and stuff like that. So I’m in the campground in an RV - it’s mine - and I’m sitting in a chair watching the sunset and this really good looking guy comes up and asks if he can join me. So I say yes and he sits down in the chair beside me. We’re talking for a bit and there’s some chemistry. He asks if he could see me again and if I would like to share dinner with him the next night and I say yes. So instantly it’s the next night and he’s brought dinner over. It’s a box of triscuit crackers. I can’t even eat wheat and in the dream I don’t ask if they’re gluten-free, but I look at what he’s brough and think, hmm this was not quite my idea of dinner. I excuse myself and say just a moment. I’ve gone back into my RV to get plates, knives and forks. I put a plate, knife and fork in front of each of us. He pours the crackers onto the plate and he pours two on each plate. I’m thinking to myself, wow, there isn’t even anything to go on top of the crackers. So he cuts his into 4 pieces, each cracker into 4 pieces. He asks me if I would like him to cut my food. He’s being chivalrous and galant about it. I accept his offer, but say I would like mine cut into 5 pieces please. I think this is funny because the triscuits won’t cut nicely into five pieces. They’re breaking and crumbling. He’s trying to cut mine into 5 pieces and I’m giggling under my breath. As he is struggling with this, I have a journal and pen in front of me. I’m writing a song called, “Take Your Crackers and Go.” It’s got song lyrics to rhyme and I think these are terribly clever. I’m using a tune to a popular rock song and am humming along as I do it. In the next part of the dream, the good looking guy is still struggling with the crackers. I walk across the RV park to the laundromat and I see my ex husband, Errant, and my son, and they’re talking to each other and preparing some food - now the laundromat also has a kitchen. I sit down in the chair waiting for them to finish what they’re doing. Errant sits down beside me, leans in and asks me what I dreamt about the night before. I start telling him - I get two sentences in and he gets up as if I wasn’t even saying anything and just walks off. He’s gone back to the kitchen. So I just sit in the chair feeling heartache. I get up out of my chair and walk into the kitchen where they are. Then my son asks me what I dreamt about and I start telling him. He would normally sit down and listen or exchange his own, and he does the exact same thing that Errant just did - listens for one sentence as though I didn’t say anything and leaves and goes upstairs. I sit back down in the chair feeling that I should not have exposed my son to Errant because he’s picking up his bad behaviors.

It was spacious with wooden floors and a black radio slightly off center on the right side. A country-rock song began to play on the radio and as it did I focused intensely on it and began to dance and sway to the music. I could make out the melody and instruments enough to tell that it was a complete song and that I had not heard it before as far as I could tell.   I could not make out much of the words. The song lasted for about 15 seconds before I woke up.  I drifted back asleep again with the same intention and this time found myself in the kitchen of my parents' house where the radio began to play a slow rock song. This time I could both make out the melody and hear every word. It was not a song that I had heard before but it combined some elements of Tears for Fears, Morten Harket, and something like CCR. I remember a phrase to the effect of: ""We all don't want to hang."" and followed up by something pertaining to dying or not dying. It wasn't a dark song and the lyrics didn't have any emotional connection.   I wish that I could remember more of the lyrics because in the dream I was focusing on them intently so that I could remember them. I hope to develop this skill to the point where I could remember longer pieces of music.  In this second dream too, I was dancing to the music. I could feel very clearly the rhythmic movement of my body as I swayed like a pendulum to the music. This seemed to help keep the dream going.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

The brightness and beauty of these images is beyond description. I then saw a lake at night under the moonlight with clouds on either side of the moon. It slowly turned into a plastic looking picture with nothing of its original beauty. I also saw snow-covered mountains.   All of these images were as clear if not clearer than anything that I have seen in real life and at least as beautiful. But the intense beauty and clarity would never last for more than a moment. This kind of thing seems to happen specifically when falling back asleep after having woken up.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

In front of me I saw a person who looked a little bit like D. from STU. I approached him and in a fatherly tone began to explain to him in a cryptic way such that he would know what I was talking about but not be able to prove that I knew about how wrong some of the things that he had done at STU were.   Then I saw that two more people were approaching: the pastor from CFC and the real D. The person who I had been talking to was only a look-alike and had been very confused by my conversation. I briefly acknowledged Derek's presence and spoke to the pastor. The pastor told me that I would be a member at CFC in a month's time thinking that in this time I would reconsider my beliefs which had stopped me from becoming one previously. In the dream (and now) I thought that this was ridiculous.   I walked past the church and saw a raised brick enclosure where one would have plants or small trees. There were some loose bricks at the base of the enclosure and I could see that inside the hollow space were a family of cats. There was a mother cat with half a dozen kittens. One of the kittens had jumped out and was being friendly toward me, but the mother was not happy about this and made it come back inside. There was a kitten there who was very hurt and unable to breathe well. I could hear its labored breathing. I attempted to help it, but the mother didn't want to let it near me. I eventually won her trust and she let me help her. I made plans to take the kittens to the vet where they could be cured, given shots, and spayed/neutered before finally being returned to their mother.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

The family that I knew was my friend Margaret and her two kids. Her husband wasn’t there, in fact there was an issue that maybe the husband walked out on them previous to this camp. The other Family was all kiddos the eldest brother my age and the siblings all under 20 and he was basically like the father figure and took care of everyone. He was an old childhood friend of my friend Margaret. There was a vibe that maybe there was something developing between them. We were painting pottery and just talking and a childhood friend of mine came and sat next to me. I knew this friend had died when I was a kid, his name is Niko. I was feeling really sad for my friend Margaret and I asked him how he was since it had been so long since I’ve seen him and asked if he had a message for me to deliver to Margaret. And he said from who and I said her mother who has deceased. He said it was a message of hope that miracles happen when you believe. I didn’t wanna upset her but I told her the message and about my friend Niko and I gave her a deck of tarot cards and said that there are ways to receive messages from our ancestors, we just have to listen and know how to ask. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw my own family sitting at a table - my mom and aunt and cousins and I was not drawn to go sit with them. I went home to my childhood house and I had invited a bunch of people from the camp to come over. I was going to teach them flower arranging. There were two Women there that wanted to make that ordeal much more complicated than it had to be. I said that I could teach flower arranging sitting on the floor, I didn’t need to build an extra table or have all these extra things I just needed the flowers and scissors in an open space but they insisted and took me out to the shed to get the materials to build a table and showed me how to use the generator to power the tools and I ended up not doing it because I didn’t need to but then I went to go use the bathroom and it was out of order and so I asked my mom if I can put up a sign and have my friends use her bathroom she said fine but she was leaving right then so she didn’t have time to straighten up so I straightened up and there were so many things in her bathroom you could barely get in so it took me a long time to do that.",Tita,last_nights_dream
121,1091,,18/01/2020,01/18/2020 00:02,"I’m traveling in a car with all my siblings - it’s a van so we can all fit. I don’t know where we’re going. We seem to be having an okay time. The scene changes really suddenly and there’s an impression that a lot of time has passed - weeks, months, perhaps. I’m really confused and don’t know how I’ve gotten to where I am. I feel like I’m waking up or seeing things that are really new and strange for me. My mom is there and she tells me that the car I had been traveling had crashed. My dad had been driving it and the accident was pretty bad. Everything is okay now. My body is fine. There’s nothing wrong with me. It seems so strange that there could have been an accident and I don’t remember it at all. She tells me it was pretty bad. I have no idea if my siblings or dad made it because it’s just me and my mom. The scene changes again and I’m with a bunch of friends from high school and some friends from now. We’re in a basement of a building. It has a huge storage unit and has all kinds of things in it from older times but also feels like a theatre costume room. We’re searching for a very specific item for one of my friends. As we go through all this stuff, it seems kind of weird - all these random bits of fabric and buttons. But we’re not finding what we’re looking for. Then the scene changes again. I’m on a soccer field and I’m really wanting to play, but I have these white shoes I need to put on and it’s taking me forever to put the shoes on and the laces are really long. My friend who is also a masseuse is there as well. He’s playing soccer and he’s playing really well. I want to go and play, but I also feel like maybe I’m not good enough and maybe that’s why it’s taking me so long to put my shoes on. Although he does keep trying to pass me the ball, but I’m still on the sidelines. It’s almost like I’m not allowed to be on the team. It’s a full size field and a full size ball, then it suddenly switches to a very small room. We’re all still trying to fit in and play soccer, and the ball has shrunk down to about the size of a softball and it’s yellow. My friend keeps trying to pass the ball to me and I keep missing. It’s like I’ve never played soccer before. Then I get tired of it because I feel like I really can’t play and I can’t get these shoes on. All of my high school friends are still around and one of them is in a bed. I go sit on the bed and talk with her. Then a bunch of others come. They’re talking about all these adventures they’ve gone and are going to go on, and all these places they’ve seen around the world. I’m sitting there feeling frustrated because I’ve not done any of that - in my whole life, I’ve not gone to have a vacation in Costa Rica or Belize and they’re telling these fantastical stories of when they’ve gone. They’re also very chummy, but I feel like the outsider - definitely outsider vibes. Then the scene shifts a little bit, and while there’s still this big bed that we’ve all congregated on, now they’re talking about Brad Pitt and another actor from way back in the day. They’re talking about how Brad Pitt keeps saying that he could date any woman he wanted, but oddly enough, he’s still single and nobody really wants to date him and how he just brags all the time. Then we’re talking about Jennifer Lopez and how she has so much money because she bought an open market in France and charges a commission for each store that is there in the market and so she just makes this passive income forever and ever. Even magazines have commented on how she has this structure and foundation so she doesn’t have to rely on the work she puts out and if her albums are any good.

122,1296,,18/01/2020,01/18/2020 00:03,"“Shady Contracts” I’m in a room full of people involved in conversations with each other. I’m sitting with a group of friends having a pleasant conversation when someone taps on my shoulder and says, “That woman over there would like to speak with you.” I’m a little annoyed that I’m being interrupted during something social to do something that feels like work. I look over that it’s Claire, a studio owner of someone I used to work with but I’ve parted ways due to her unethical practices. I refuse to go over there and just tell the messenger that I’m busy. I continue talking with my friends, but he’s persistent. He won’t leave me alone. He stalks me everywhere. So I finally go over there just to tell her to piss off. There’s a pile of documents on the table and I see they’re spread out a bit. I see sticking out from one of them, my name. So now I’m sucked into engaging with them because I want to know why my name is on a piece of paper. They should not have anything to do with me - we never signed a contract, though I always wanted to. So there’s nothing that has my signature on it. He sees me glance at it and my arm is reaching to pull it out from the bottom. He swipes it first. He is her representative - at some point he’s told me this or I’ve just assumed it from the conversation, but he’s definitely behaving like it now. So I say, “What is that with my name on it?” He says it’s a contract. I say it can’t be because I’ve never signed anything with Claire here or her studio. He says, “It says here that you release her from any responsibility for any shady interactions or any responsibility for her past actions. “ I’m a little bit outraged and refuse. I say, “I’m not signing anything like that. It’s a lie!” I also don’t think that she should escape accountability for her actions. At this point she speaks and says she’s applying for a new business and she needs all her past employees to sign this contract in order for her to have a pristine business record and move forward to something else. I still refuse to sign it because it’s dishonest. I want the piece of paper and I say, “I’m taking this with me.” The representative says, “You can’t take that with you. It’s a legal piece of paper that doesn’t belong to you.” I say, “Yes I can because it has my name on it.” Then Claire says, “You can take it with you.” She reaches out to shake my hand and I realize that there’s a bulky piece of folded up paper in it and something that feels cold, like ceramic. So I look down in my hand and examine the ceramic thing. The closest I can describe it is those ceramic things in old lady’s bathrooms that you put the end of the toothpaste in and start to roll from the bottom up so that it squeezes all the toothpaste out. It looks like that, but is twice as wide, probably 6 inches wide. There’s a small chain attached to it. At the end is a tiny hook that looks somewhat like a paperclip that’s been partially unfolded. I’m thinking, what the heck is this? It’s glazed in white with blue and has my name on it. Is this something to mount a piece of paper on? There’s a hook and chain on it. So I’m puzzling over this. Then I open up the eight-times folded piece of paper and see that it’s a check for $201 from her to me. I realize that she’s trying to pay me for my silence. I still refuse to sign it but I walk away with the check and this bound thing that would bind me to her forever symbolically. Although I didn’t get the piece of paper with my name on it - I didn’t sign it. I walk away and I’m feeling like I don’t even want this check or this ceramic thing. So I turn around and she’s still at the table, but I’m walking towards them and all the footsteps I take aren’t bringing me closer to the table. I can still see her and I’m not any closer. This is really frustrating me. Then the scene morphs into I’m trying to walk through this row of beds, like you’d see in a television orphanage (I’ve never actually been in an orphanage). There’s a bunch of single beds lined up and they all have people in them and all their belongings with them, like homeless people. I have to step over all of them because mine’s at the very end. It has a change of clothing with a hairbrush, toothpaste, some snack-like foods that come already pre-packaged, like cookies in a bag. There’s a television there as well. Everyone has their own television and I’m like, “Oh, I guess this is where I have to sleep for now.” I’m angry that I have to step over all these people. I’m angry that someone is partially lying on my own bed. Just as I lie down in it to get comfortable, these two teenagers come up and say that it’s their turn to have the bed now. They have this piece of paper to prove it. I’m like, “Are you kidding me?!” I didn’t even notice that was on the piece of paper and now I don’t have anywhere to sleep and I’m mad and I’m swearing and I’m yelling and I’m saying, “Fine, but you can’t have it until all my stuff’s gone. Get out, stand back there and I’ll tell you when I’m ready.” I start taking my sheets and blankets off my bed, and I’m taking all the little things and putting them in my backpack. I do that, step over all the people and leave really angry. Then I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I was invited to work offsite and someone (a colleague from NYC a decade ago) came to bring me there but I wasn’t able to navigate the muddy road in my shoes. We tried to go another way but there was a large stone gate covered in green moss. I told them to go ahead without me. Then, it was dark and I was in a city (maybe San Francisco) and trying to find my way home. I found a dog and tried to return it to this house and it was a dog rescue. They asked if I wanted cats, too. I am allergic but said I would meet them. They tried to get me to take three cats and I remember feeling scared that they weren’t declawed (in real life I don’t know enough about it but my sister has a cat and thinks declawing isn’t humane). In the dream there was a dog who came with us and we left the cats. I kept thinking about my ex’s dogs because I consider them mine and wondering if they would get along. I kept doing the math that it would be three dogs total (but it would be four). This dog was about 30-40 pounds with reddish golden hair like one of the goldens, Chuck. He came home with me and my dog Pinto. In my building we are only supposed to have one dog so I was worried about being caught, but knew my dog Pinto would be happier and wouldn’t howl when I left (he’s been doing that lately) because now he would have a friend.

The patio area has these huge columns like the Roman columns you see in ruins. It’s night time. It’s dark out. There’s a lot of people I don’t know at the party, but there’s a lot of my classmates from high school there, too. We’re hanging out but I have this feeling of being the outsider and not really welcomed or not included somehow. I’m watching what’s going on and I’m trying to get the attention of my classmates but I’m awkward about it and I don’t really know how. Then one of my classmates who I’ve known since we were 8 sees me and hangs out together and kinda takes me under his wing. He’s showing me around this party - just the outside perimeter part, we still haven’t gone into any of the building. He’s getting really comfortable with me. His arm is around me and there’s this air of ownership almost. I do not like it. I remember when we were in high school and flashing back to when he was a little more touchy feely than I liked. I’m not excited that he’s doing that, but I also wanted to see everyone. Eventually I peel myself away. Then some sort of time goes by and I’m walking around this party and I realize there’s this point on one side where it was the outside of the party and there’s grass fields and trees. Time is going on normally. But there’s a partition and on the other side of this line, everything has been frozen. The people there are asleep. I realize that if I cross over this line and walk into it, I can see them, I can see that they’re asleep or frozen and I can also bring them out of it. When I do, six years has passed on one side of the line and no time has passed on their side. It’s very odd. They’re still who they were and time has gone on on the other side. The dreams shifts completely and my two children are with me. We are walking down to the beach. We walk down this path and on either side of the path are noni bushes - bushes I grew up with in Hawaii. As soon as I come out of the path onto the walkway that skirts the edge of the beach, a lifeguard greets me and says, “hello, good morning, welcome.” I look up and it’s my ex boyfriend who used to be a lifeguard. I’m so surprised that he was so friendly to me. I say, “hello.” He sees who it is and the friendliness disappears immediately. He says something nasty. I ask him if he’s still going to be mean to me and if he’s still mad at me. He says essentially yes forever. That hurt my feelings a little bit but I realized there wasn’t much I could do about that. He couldn’t keep me off the beach with the kids and we keep going. I see to my left a huge pool - an outdoor pool. Some of those same friends from the party are in the pool and I feel like I’ve been looking for them. I head their direction and the kids are with me, but again I feel this weird outsider feeling like I wasn’t quite invited and I’m going to be the weird kid that shows up at the party even though they weren’t invited. But I walk towards the pool anyway and both the kids get in the pool because they’re really excited to swim. I’m staying on the edge and all those classmates are ignoring me. But then they start playing with my son and teaching him how to jump in the pool. They continue to ignore me even though they can very clearly see me. My daughter is not excited about this either. She can see that there’s this outsider vibe going and she’s backing off and away, too. I’m trying to keep an eye on her and an eye on my son. Then we get out of the pool and begin to walk away.

132,1093,,20/01/2020,01/20/2020 00:04,"I’m on a beach - lots of sand, kiawe trees all around and they’re hanging kind of low. I’m on set. There’s a movie being filmed. I’m not part of the movie. I’m just watching. I can hear the ocean rolling in, the waves are not to be big and I’m listening to the all actors say their lines. There’s about five of them sitting around in chairs doing their scenes and one of the actors is Henry Cavill - the guy who plays Superman. I’m a little bit starstruck and awestruck, but I’m staying out of the way just watching him. I have no idea why I’m there. So I watch them for a little bit and he takes a while to come out onto the set to do his lines, but then he leaves. I have definitely got an eye on him - just watching everything he does. Then somehow I get incorporated into the scene and it’s not so much that they’re filming anymore, it’s that all of the actors and myself, we’re all hanging out, working out. The beach setting has changed to an outdoor weight room setting with weight machines. It’s like we’re playing musical chairs but we’re doing it with the weight machines and we all keep going from one to the next. Somehow I’m part of the crew even though it’s all the actors now and we take turns doing our sets and then we all rotate one and get moved to the next machines. Of course I still have my eye on Henry Cavill because he played Superman, he’s hot. But there’s not a lot of talking still. All the other actors talk amongst themselves quite a bit, but I’m still quiet and observing for the most part. I think I answer a few questions from some of the other actors, but I’m feeling shy. Then I leave that place. Even though I’ve been integrated with the cast, I leave and go somewhere else - it’s outside and I have the impression that it’s part of a school. The handyman of the school - who in real life in this realm is the handyman at the place I live - he’s there at this school. There’s a big white box truck. He’s telling me how excited he is because they cleared out the storage units and got rid of hundreds of pounds of meat and pork. I’m so confused because I don’t know why they have meat and pork in the storage units because usually the handyman has all of the tools in the storage units. But I ask him, “hey, if you have more, let me know, because if you’re just giving away really good meat I will take it.” He says, “yes, but mostly it’s all gone.” I’m just excited for him because he’s so excited. Then I leave that place and go back to the set area and now it’s a much bigger area. It’s not just that beach. There’s an actual set where there’s scenery that’s been built and put up. It’s also part of a neighborhood. I can see houses and there’s streets. I’m sitting on a couch and I’m very very tired so I’m half laying on it. One of the actors - a male - comes and sits next to me. Because we’ve all spent time getting to know each other, it’s very comfortable, it’s fine that he sits next to me. Then I see Henry Cavill come towards me and he doesn’t have anything in his hand yet, but he kneels down and he says, “You have to have known that it was going to be one of the two of us that was going to come and propose to you,” - but not like a marriage proposal, but just like be my partner for life type of proposal. I’m smiling at him because I knew that it would happen, I just didn’t know when. So I say of course. Then he backs up and pulls this violin out from under the couch and some of the other cast members and the orchestra that was part of the movie playing the soundtrack start to play this song and it’s so funny because it’s weird and it’s a little bit high pitched. They’ve got violins and they’re all singing the song. I can’t remember what the words are, but it’s for me. I’m laughing because it’s such a funny sounding song, but apparently the whole cast and crew were in on it because they’re singing and they all seem very excited. There’s one moment where I look up and I do see an old classmate of mine who’s been lurking in the background and for one moment I have this huge pang of jealousy because she knew about it before I did and she didn’t tell me. I get this sense that she didn’t want it to happen. She wanted Henry for herself. But I pushed that aside because it’s very clear that he’s head over heels and nothing is changing that because now the entire set or staging area or place where this movie is being filmed is full of all of these onlookers and he’s made such a point to make sure that everybody knows that I’m his number one person, even though he goes back and does scenes. He comes back to me every single time in the sweetest way. He’s really very sweet and for the most part, everyone is totally happy about it and I am too. Then the scene shifts just a little bit and I’m sitting with a young girl who’s part of the cast and we’ve moved onto the set. We’re off that couch and now I’m onto the set somewhere down on those streets. She’s getting ready to say her lines and whatnot. She’s showing me this necklace that she has and she says, “My mama gave me money for when I finish this play I could go buy a bike.” She shows me the bike, but this girl is maybe five or six, not really reading yet, but she’s really really cute with curly blonde hair and this necklace seems to be very important to her - it has the symbol of a bike on it. I’m very attentive to her and some other babies that end up in the crowd and I’m watching them. Even though it’s now part of the scene we’re creating, Henry and I have a baby between us - it’s not ours, it’s a baby that was cast in the role, but he and I are now acting with this baby and taking care of it in a way. Then the scene ends and the dream moves on, but I’ve forgotten the rest.",Rose,last_nights_dream
133,1297,,20/01/2020,01/20/2020 00:05,"“The Explosion” I’m in a garage and it’s open. It’s set up like a garage sale - the garage is open, there’s all kinds of stuff, tables going down the driveway and all kinds of eclectic assortment of things for sale. Then there’s some other bigger things like bicycles and whatnot and some furniture and other freestanding items. It’s dense with material items as well as a traffic of people going back and forth. This is not my house. This is my friend’s house. He’s currently playing his old drum set at the back of the garage. He’s facing out so he can see who comes and goes and be of assistance if someone asks a question. I’m just hanging out there chatting casually with him. One of the women that comes up is an attractive brunette and she’s wearing a mini skirt. I notice that her body is very svelte like she works out and I notice this and think, wow she’s really attractive. She starts asking my friend about some item that she’s interested in. As he is answering her, she turns around so her back is to him, and she bends over to pick something up. Then this explosion comes out of her butt and the whole garage is sprayed with shit! It’s all over everything. I’m incredulous. I’m astonished that she’s done this and she just stands up and acts like nothing’s happened. She doesn’t apologize and she just walks away. My friend has got some of this on him and instead of cleaning himself up, he goes over and starts wiping up the stuff that is on the floor around the yard sale items without seeming to notice that he’s got some of it on him and he needs to go wash his face. I’m just really disgusted. For some reason I’m mute. I’m not saying anything, but I’m in horror. Then the dream shifts from that scene. I’m in another friend’s house. She’s a person I know in real life, she’s a substitute mom to me. I’m in her house and I’m upstairs. I’m helping sort something out. It goes from that scene of sorting to a restaurant I worked at while in University.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

Maybe there were low ceilings or the tables were close together. I made it to the final table, but as usual, I was low on chips. I had to make moves or go bust. I looked down at my hand and it was some offsuit garbage. I folded. My next hand, however, was KJo or similar which was good enough for a shove. I started the hand with 4k chips and somehow managed to get through and rake in the pot ending up with a total of 9k chips. My very next hand is QQ which I of course shove. I get two callers and the flop comes out with a Q. The turn pairs the board and I think I'm worried that someone has a higher boat, but I hit quads on the river.

142,1094,,22/01/2020,01/22/2020 00:01,"I have a mentoring meeting with one of my clients. I’ve ridden my bike to her place and park it in the garage. She meets me there. We’re talking about whatever it is she needs to talk about it. We go upstairs into her apartment and we have our session. She’s talking about actually having another baby with her partner, which is a big deal because it would have to be in vitro fertilization. She already has another child who is a little bit older. At a certain point she has to go pick them up, so we end our session after talking. She goes into her bedroom and grabs another child - a younger child, a little black orphan baby that she has adopted. It was not an infant, maybe 3 or 4 or 5, had been sleeping in the bedroom the whole time and I didn’t know. She puts the child in a front carrier, straps in, and heads out. We’re both heading out back down the stairs from her apartment to her garage where my bike is and her car is. I’m just surprised that there was another child in the apartment the whole time and apparently sleeping, but it didn’t come up in our conversation either. I thought it was so strange. She goes out. She leaves with her other child to pick up her child from school. I get my bike and start riding it down the street because I’m heading towards an Imbolc festival. As I’m riding my bike, I get off and walk. I’m walking down the main street that I grew up on in my childhood. I’m seeing the mountains to my right - they’re beautiful, covered in green grass and I can see the tree line. Then of course I can see all of the houses - the regular neighborhoods that I passed every day in my childhood. I’m heading down to the high school I went to as I was growing up and that is where the festival is. So I cross the little bridge that has a stream under it and I take a right into the school and I make it right past the cattle gate into the main entrance and set my bike down. I also have this strange lingering feeling that I have my own children I’m supposed to be watching. They show up at the school and I take them in and bring them through the entrance where I pay for admission. My old mentor who I learned some of my priestessing skills in my priestess apprenticeship is there. She is there to take us all on a guided journey before I get into the rest of the festival. It’s me and whoever else has shown up at the entrance of the gate, which I find interesting because she’s only taking the people who have been trained as priestesses to go do this meditation, and two of the other women that I see there - besides the women I went through the program with - are actually high school classmates of mine who tell me, “Oh yeah, we started this program five years ago. We’ve always been priestesses.” I’m really shocked because I didn’t see them the entire time I was on the program and also I feel a little bit betrayed, like I had been told that the group of us that had been going through the program was it and to find out there were other people that we didn’t know about in our spiral is very disturbing to me. We lay down anyway and we’re going through this meditation. I can hear my mentor’s voice and she says very specific words, which I cannot remember now. But there’s also a part where she sprinkles turmeric and saffron over us - those are the two herbs we are meant to be using with this meditation. And then I can feel my body taking in the herbs, taking in the words - there’s definitely a change in what feels like my consciousness and my field. When it’s done, I get up and I know it’s time for me to leave. I’m not supposed to stay there with the other priestesses or the people she had brought in to do this blessing. I head into the rest of the festival. It’s interesting, I can see yellow tulips everywhere. These tulips seem to be playing an important part of this Imbolc festival. Then I leave because I’m still so upset about these two women who were my high school classmates who also suddenly turned out to be these priestesses that I didn’t know that they were. They have some disdain and contempt for me because I had left the path early and I don’t like any of it. So I leave the festival and somehow the scene changes completely. I’m in a home with my mom and my dad and my dad is trying to keep the inside of the house - I think it was supposed to be my childhood home - he’s trying to keep it in order, keep it clean. My mom is in another section of the house - her office - and there’s her and a bunch of people in it and they’re all brainstorming jobs - how to work, how to make money. They’re making the assumption that I’m part of it, I’m going to start working it. But I’m actually in the office trying to brainstorm my own programs, my own classes, my own way to get more clients. They keep including me in their discussion and finally I get really pissed off and start yelling. I grab their papers they’ve been writing on and tear them up, rip them up. They finally say oh, okay, she’s not going to help with that and they go back to writing on their whiteboards brainstorming. I’m so annoyed that I get up and head out to a restaurant that they apparently also own. I can’t tell if both my parents own it or just one, but I go to the restaurant and there’s this pressure on me to help work in that restaurant too and I do not want to, but I do need money. So I go into the restaurant and it’s interesting because a different classmate is a server in the restaurant and there’s another man - two men are in there. They sit me down and they walk me through the way this restaurant works and how the emphasis is on kindness to the employees, which is so different from the restaurant experience I have where everyone is cutthroat and the chefs brandish knives at you and whatnot. So they are explaining to me how the restaurant works and how my duties would be as manager and how little I would have to do. I’m still not sold, I don’t want to work at a restaurant, I’ve already done that. While we’re sitting down at the meeting, people are coming into the restaurant and eating. Things are flowing. I can hear glasses clinking and silverware being used and orders being yelled out and lots of conversation. I look to my right and there’s this huge square table with 12 people sitting at it and they’re singing to a cat trying to communicate to the cat to do something. The cat is actually responding to it - it reminds me of snake charmers and all of these students know exactly what they’re doing. They’re communicating to this cat through singing, all 12 of them, and they are getting the cat to do what they want it to do and I’m just fascinated watching this happen. Then my attention goes back to the two guys I’m in the meeting with and I just tell them, “it’s lovely, you’re lovely, the restaurant seems lovely. The restaurant seems to run quite well, but I’m not interested. I don’t want to work in a restaurant.” Then the scene changes again, but I’ve forgotten the rest of the dream.",Rose,last_nights_dream
143,1298,,22/01/2020,01/22/2020 00:02,"“The Water” My dream begins in a shopping mall that has two levels. I’m going down the escalator. My son is in front of me. I see someone I know from yoga class. He invites my son and I to his and his partner’s cottage. I accept. So, we actually have our swimming stuff and a change of clothes with us because the reason my son and I are at the mall is because we are picking up a few things for a picnic because we’re about to go swimming. So we do this - we pick up some things in a store and I pack them in a drawstring bag and we get into our car. It is really, really, really hot and I’m thirsty. We drive a little bit to the place where there’s swimming - it’s a man made thing. I get out of the car and I open the backdoor and realize that there’s no water. I always have water. I don’t even buy other things to drink, I just bring water. I look in the back with the picnic stuff and there’s cans - and I don’t even buy anything in cans - of something called Crush. There’s a rootbeer one and an orange flavor and a grape flavor. I say to my son, “Oh no, look! This is all we have to drink and I’m so thirsty!” He takes the orange one so I pick up the rootbeer one and I open it up and I lift it up like the way Popeye takes spinach where you can see the stream of spinach go from the can into his mouth and I’m pouring the rootbeer into my mouth. I’m simultaneously disgusted by this sugary gooky dark color and I’m surprised that this is actually quenching my thirst. I down the whole thing and then it’s gone but I’m still thirsty. While I’m doing this, some stranger in the parking lot comes up to me and says, “You’re not allowed to have those here, they have alcohol in them.” And I’m like, “What?! I didn’t know that.” And then I’m worried because my son has one, so I look for him. He’s already finished his and he looks fine - he’s not acting like there’s been any alcohol and I’m not feeling like there’s been any alcohol, so I suspect what the stranger has said to me is incorrect. I’m also looking on the can and nowhere on the can does it say that there’s alcohol in it, although I’m also suspicious of the can because as I suspicious of all cans of sugary gooky drinks anyway with the list of 50 ingredients, none of which is actually a food group, well maybe one of them is alcohol and I’m dubious to begin with. At any rate, we place our empty cans in a recycle container and continue onto the water. I say to my son because he’s also thirsty, “You know, so am I. It must because it’s so hot. Let’s go swim and maybe that will quench our thirst.” So we dive into the pool and it’s an interesting pool - it’s not a square pool with chlorine. It’s round like a natural pool and made of the earth, but it's also so sculpted that you know it’s man made and it’s tiny in comparison to an inland natural pool in Canada which is very very deep because they’re made by glaciers. So we swim and the water is very refreshing. Then we’re finished swimming and we come out, dry ourselves off and lie there for a bit, then I suddenly remember, “Oh we were invited to A and his partner’s cottage! We need to go now if we’re going to get here before dark.” My son is excited, so we pack up our things, get back in the car, drive to their cottage and arrive. I realize we haven’t had anything to eat and I’m hoping they’re going to feed us. They ask, “Oh good, there you are. Have you had dinner?” We say no. So they do make us something even though they’ve already eaten. We’re sitting around the table chitchatting. They have three cats and they’re huge! One of them is stretched out on the top of the table. Its body is the same length as the table and you know how cats will roll from one side, over their back, to the other side when they like someone. So the cat’s on the table doing this rolling thing and the man comments to me: “Oh he must like you. He doesn’t normally do that.” So I pat him and he immediately gets up and gets down off the table. They show us where the spare bedroom is. My son and I go to bed, go to sleep, wake up - there’s nothing eventful. When we wake up, we’re repacking and the night before we hadn’t gone through the cottage, but as we’re standing having a morning tea on the back deck, I think, “Oh this landscape looks familiar.” To the side of their cottage is a really tall fence - it must be 30 or 50 feet tall and sticking out from the top of it is the rooftop and turrets of this fantastically architected house. I think, “Wow! It’s massive and beautiful.” It’s got gingerbread work and curvature and there’s ironwork on top of the gingerbread work and each turret has a weathervane that looks hand carved out of iron.” It’s gorgeous. I think, “I’ve seen this landscape before.” But everything is partially covered up and I can only see the fences, some covered boats and the water in front of me. It is Lake Ontario and I’m realizing it is familiar and I’ve traveled Lake Ontario sailing many times. I’m excited now to see it from a different angle - from someone else’s cottage, as I always start from my home and go under the bridge. I’ve never come from the shore that’s further along. We prepare to sail and as we bring our bags down to the shore, they have a boat. They also have a luge that only fits one person - it’s long and narrow and slightly curved. I see they have one of these and I ask if I can ride in that one, too. They say, “Are you sure because it’s really low down on the water, close to the surface?” I say, “Yes, I would love to.” My son gets in the boat with them. I get in the luge. As we leave their dock, I suddenly notice that what I thought was rocks were not. There are hundreds of covered boats and it’s just that the covers are the same color as the water. So there’s actually quite a bit of traffic to navigate through here. But we do. This luge has a small motor, but I’m not actually sure if it has a motor...I think I’m just being propelled by the currents of the water. It’s a little rough, but there’s no whitecaps, so I’m navigating through this okay. I do realize that it’s challenging though. We navigate out into the open water. I look back and everyone’s smiling on their sailboat. My son looks happy, so this is all good. As I’m looking back, I see all these other, what I thought were cottages but are not, they’re mansions and each one is unique and different and they’re incredibly beautiful. So I’m admiring this from low down in the water and appreciating that I can see this because we were invited to their cottage. Then the water gets a little more rough. It’s kind of hard to control the luge so I’m focusing on this and I start to feel really small because as we get out to the open water there are some quite large yachts that are right beside me. At one point I slightly regret my decision to choose this vehicle instead of being on the boat where they are, but I continue for a little bit longer. And then they come up closer and say, “Everyone is starting to take their covers off and there’s going to be a lot more traffic here and it could be dangerous. We think you should come in and join us.” So I do. They pull me in with a rope. They put the luge on their own boat at the side and I get on. We need money to go through the customs line on the border before you enter the harbor. We need money to pay to cross, like a toll. I say, “Oh no, I did not bring any money. I did not realize that we needed this.” My son says, “Oh mom, I got some when we were at the mall.” I say, “Oh, good for you! What did you bring?” He takes these bills out and they’re really long and narrow. They’re about 12 inches long and 3 inches wide. He’s got them folded in half and half again. And the top two are American. The ones in the middle are Cuban. I say, “Why would the bank give you that?” He says, “I don’t know. I didn’t request those kinds of funds.” Then I say to my friend, “Do you think they’ll accept this Cuban money?” My friend says, “I don’t know, but I have lots of our own money. We’ll just cover it.” Then he folds up a $20 bill and gives it to my son. I say, “Oh, you don’t have to do that.” My son looks a little uncomfortable. My friend says, “No, no, it’s fine. I just want to give this to him.” I should just graciously accept this gift then. Then I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

146,1095,,23/01/2020,01/23/2020 00:02,"I’m sitting in an outdoor market. It’s sunny out and warm. I have shorts and a tank top on, my hair is down, and I’m having a beverage of some sort, doing some work. I look up and I see across the way, two women heading my direction. One is tall and dark hair, pale skin. The other one is shorter with lighter skin and blonde hair. I recognize the tall dark one, she is a friend of mine, or we were friends but it ended strangely and abruptly and I still have feelings of sadness, frustration and hurt around it. So, I see them strolling through this open marketplace and pretend not to see them - I put my face down and go back to work and put my hand up over my face. However, they stop right in front of my table anyway and when I look up, the tall dark-haired one says hello and seems to be very happy to see me. I’m a little bit cautious and wary and say hello and ask how they are and what do they want? nicely but I don’t feel particularly warm towards them. However, they persist and the tall dark-haired one invites me to go with them just to continue wandering around outside. It is such a nice day. I actually say okay. Part of me is warming up to her, but part of me still wants to say, hey you ghosted me, why are you even talking to me now? We start wandering through the marketplace and we go into shops and out of shops. I think we both already had our coffee or beverages, but we wander around getting gelato and some other things. At one point, she hands me a ring. I look at the ring, it’s very simple, I think there’s just a couple of stones in it, and I don’t remember what the stones are. It fits on my finger, which is rare because I have larger fingers. It’s lovely and I love rings, so I wear the ring. We continue to walk around and at what point we walk past this group of my other high school friends who are out on a lawn doing a bootcamp style workout. I introduced my taller friend and my shorter friend to the friends of mine who are doing this bootcamp. For whatever reason, I am struggling to remember the shorter blonde friend’s name, even though I know it, I’m having the hardest time in the introduction. I keep beating around the bush hoping she’ll just introduce herself, which she doesn’t and it just feels awkward and I eventually give it up as a bad job because I just can’t remember her name. After the awkward introductions we join them in their bootcamp. They’re doing abs. And so we all get into a hollow rock and I show them how to do a hollow rock with good technique. Then that’s done and we all get up. The tall friend and shorter friend and I continue on our way. Now we’re out from the marketplace and we’re in a slightly wooded area, but we’re walking through a corridor where there are no trees - the trees are on either side of us. It’s warm, so they’re all green and in full leaf and it’s a grassy area - it’s not a path, it’s wider than a path - that we’re walking through. In the distance, I can see there’s a cage and there’s people in it and there’s also all this light glinting off of metal. This metal looks like a wave or when a bird flaps its wings or when you watch a bunch of birds flying together or a school of fish and they all move together at the same time. As I get closer, we can see that it is indeed people, but instead of hands they have butcher knives and that’s the metal that the light is being glinted off of. They’re moving all in unison as a wave, doing some sort of dance in this cage, which is rather tightly packed and they’re managing not to cut themselves. However in my mind I’m thinking they must be rather dangerous because they are in a cage and they have butcher knives for hands. They are all men in business suits. We continue on after watching them for a little bit and there’s another cage right past this one. In this cage the people all have scissors for hands, kind of like Edward Scissorhands, the movie. We go by, but one of them calls out to us and stops us and tells my taller friend to give him some of the pearls that she has. She has two pearls and so she gives two of them. We watch as somehow with these scissor hands he makes two pearl earrings. He also has some other pieces that go with the pearls, so these earrings become rather big like a larger stone at the bottom and the pearl at the top, and he’s somehow managing to make these while we’re standing there. They are absolutely beautiful. He has scissor hands, he’s still doing it and we’re not sure how this is happening, but he makes this beautiful pair of earrings reaching through the bars of the cage this whole time. No one has been let out of any cages. She takes the earrings when he’s done and we continue on. It’s the most strange thing. We move past these cages and now we’re in a home of sorts. We’re all wanting a shower, it’s been hot out. So we go through this little shower that is part of this home - the rest of the home I don’t see at all. I just see that the shower is all tile and it’s the small 1x1 tile squares. They’re all a dark grey, but also translucent - kind of reminds me of labradorite, but instead of blues and greens, it’s greys. I drop my ring in the shower somewhere and I’m so upset about it. I want to find it. The two friends have gone on ahead of me. I was the last one in and they have wandered off somewhere. Now I’m on hands and knees looking for this ring. It’s kind of gross because the floor of the shower is covered in hair. The shower is for anyone to use even though it’s in a home, so who knows what I’m crawling through and I’m really grossed out. On the other hand I’m really fascinated because every single corner and crevice of this shower has, along with the hair and other gross stuff, a bunch of different beautiful rings. None of them look like the one I dropped which I’m getting upset about because it was given to me by this friend, but they’re all gorgeous. They all have different stones in them. They’re all different sizes. Some of them are the kind where they incase your entire finger. Some of them are very simple - one little golden band with a tiny little opal heart. One of them has gold shaped up and around and sticks up off your finger. They’re just amazing and I’m picking up all these rings. This other pair of women come in. As I’m picking up all these rings I’m thinking, “these are beautiful and I’m going to keep some of them, but also I really want to find mine.” But this other pair of women come in and start looking for a ring they’ve lost and I don’t want to show them all the ones I have, but they start crawling around on the ground and they’re picking up rings, too. So eventually we compare rings. She finds the one she’s looking for. I don’t find mine, but I find others. I’m really sort of heartbroken about this. At this point I take the rings I want and I go out the backdoor of this shower place and I meet up with my two friends who have been waiting for me. We continue on and now we’re in some place that looks like the pictures I’ve seen of Merikesh where there’s lots of stone everywhere and stone arches and they’re lighter in color. We’re walking through and I’m beginning to get sad because I know our time is coming to an end and both friends are going to leave and I still haven’t found the ring even though I’ve got ones that I like. I know that I have no idea when I’ll see either of these friends again and it’s making me a little upset. Then the dream ends.",Rose,last_nights_dream
147,1299,,23/01/2020,01/23/2020 00:03,"“Boundaries and Brats” This dream setting is in a house. I’ve had lots of dreams set in this house. It’s long and narrow, although the rooms are plenty big enough - they’re just longer than they are wide. There're houses in New Orleans called shotgun houses because they’re long like that and the entrance to all the rooms are off the hallway, so if you’re driving by and shooting a gun, you could shoot a bullet in the front door and it goes all the way through the house and out the backdoor. So I guess it’s a shotgun house. We’re in the very back room of this house, which is my bedroom. We’re having a house discussion, so all the people that live there are having a conversation about pets. We have lots and I love pets. But one of them has a cow and I don’t want it lying on my bed because it runs around outside and in the backyard, too, where there’s poops lying around on the grass, so it’s got poops on its feet or it could have at any given time. I don’t want that on my bed. So I’m saying, “Animals, if they can be trained to stay on the floor, then that’s fine, they’re allowed in my room. But if they’re up on my bed, then I won’t also allow them in my room.” The cow is in the room while we’re saying this. As I’m talking, it’s doing this sad eyes and pouty mouth. First it puts its head in my lap and looks sad, then it rolls a little bit at a time, like a toddler does when they’re limp and you’re trying to get them to walk and they just turn into a blob. It’s doing this. Then it’s on the bed. So I push it off and it’s heavy - it’s got a great big belly and it’s bigger than I am and it’s head is the size of my torso. But I push it back onto the floor and it looks at me mournfully. But I’m saying, “No, get off my bed.” But the people I’m having this discussion with don’t even hear me. And they say, “Okay, so it’s alright if the cow is on your bed as long as your bed is made and the quilt is on.” I say, “No! I just finished saying, not on my bed under any circumstances!” Then the dream instantaneously is full of people and one of the roommates is having a birthday party for an 8-10 year old kid. So it feels like there’s hundreds of these kids around and they start opening my drawers and pulling out my shirts. One of them has a pair of scissors and they’re making costumes to dress up with. She starts to cut up one of my shirts and use the pieces of it for something else. I say, “You’re not allowed to do that, get out of my dresser. Close the drawer.” She looks at me and rolls her eyes like that 13 year old girl way - make a face. Then she leaves, but I see her looking back as she’s leaving and I intuit that she’s just waiting until I’m out of my room and she’s going to come back in anyway. So I put my clothes that they’ve taken out back in the dresser drawers. So there’s nothing on the floor and my room is back intact again. I close the door. I go through this crowd of kids to look for the roommate who is responsible for them. This person has no defining features, I can’t tell if they’re a man or woman, they’re just a roommate. I say to the roommate, “You need to tell these kids that they’re not allowed in my room.” They’re like a phantom. I don’t really get a response from them and I realize it’s my responsibility to keep these kids out of my room. So I turn around and I see my bedroom door is open. So I go back in. This time I’m angry and I’m like, “I told you guys not to do this and you’re doing it anyway! I’m taking your scissors and all this stuff you’ve made because you’re not respecting this!” I kick them out of my room again with these angry words and push them out with my hands. I can feel my hands making contact with them. Now they’re giving me the angry teenager rolling eyes angry look. So they’re looking back at me and I’m standing there like grrrr. I look down the hallway and the roommate is now aware of my displeasure and decides to take them to a movie instead. But it’s communicated to me that it’s not because they’re respecting my boundaries or making the kids aware that there are boundaries they need to follow, but that “Oh well Freya is grumpy and terrible so we’re just going to go somewhere else.”",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I’m back in the small town I lived in when I went to high school. There are at least fifty people in the dream and they’re all people I know. One is my ex-best friend. Part of my psyche recognizes her - she’s in the same house as everyone else - and my dream psyche says to my non-dream psyche, “Oh you’re not triggered that you see her.” And my non-dream psyche answers back, “No, hmm, I’m not.” But I still had some distance from her and in the dream we’re not friends. The setting: The house is in the town I grew up in and it’s full of people. I do know all of them. I go from room to room. We’re having casual conversations. It’s a potluck, so these conversations are over food. There’s catch up time. One guy is sitting by himself in the living room. He’s wearing a tuxedo without the jacket and he’s pulled the bib part of it over his face and he’s just sitting there so no one can talk to him, but we all know who it is, so it’s odd. I realize as I’m conversing and connecting with these people - I still keep in touch with a lot of these people, but I left that town because I couldn’t stand living there - one of the things I’ve missed is the sense of community. Aside from it being a potluck, there are renovations going on in the house. The house belongs to one of my friends. The backyard also has a large barn in it that’s empty. The place may have been a farm once, but the farmland would have been sold off. So there’s just a large backyard now with a barn in it. So he’s gathered all these people together. We’ve all brought our own food. He’s describing what he wants the finished product to look like. Everybody is offering something of their service - one of the skills they're good at. The purpose of the potluck is to make a decision as a community of who’s going to do what. And then the other thing that goes along with it is that the property’s big and all the people that are putting some effort into it will also be able to enjoy the property when it’s done. This joy and the shared usage of it after, even though it’s owned by one and not by everybody, is part of the discussion of the renovations. “Oh, we can do this with it and that will make it big enough for all these people and we can come back here and do this!” “I can store my snowmobile here!” “I can put my motorcycle here!” “Oh here’s a big place I can take my dog out to run!” So it’s this whole building of community and that’s what the dream was about.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

151,1301,,25/01/2020,01/25/2020 00:01,"“The Recital” In this dream, my son has spontaneously asked me if I would be his accompaniment at a recital. Of course I agreed. When we get there, we’re given the book that we are to select a song from and there’s someone else sitting with us that knows us, but I have no idea who it is - I don’t know them in real life, I don’t know them in dream life, they don’t say anything, they just sit there, but they carry the energy of a male that we know. My son passes me the song book and I look at it. I turn through every single page and I don’t know any of the songs. They’re all classical and I don't have a classical guitar, I have an acoustic guitar with me. My son indicates the song that we should play and it’s really really complicated. I start trying to practice it and of course my guitar is out of tune. It’s almost impossible to tune because there’s so much noise in this place. When there’s not noise, somebody else is on the stage playing so I can’t be tuning my guitar. They call numbers, like a lottery, for who plays next, so I never know if we’re going to be the next one to play and we’re unprepared. I ask my son if he’s ever sang this song before and he says no, he doesn’t even know the tune. I’m starting to get really anxious. I start walking around to see who else is there. I see another couple - I do know them in real life. They have prepared a piece as well. I just express: “Oh wow, I didn’t realize you played classical guitar” One of the couple says that she does - she’s been playing it since she was a kid. She pulls off a few riffs and I’m like, “Wow you’re so good!” Then I keep walking around and there’s no one on the stage for some time. So I walk up the stage and go off on stage left and there’s an office and my teacher from grade 4 is in there. I go in and talk to him for a little bit. Interesting that he also plays guitar - he played guitar for us every day in grade 4 in real life, and I suspect in my dream I may have brought him in because I need some support with guitar. However, this is not what we talk about in the dream. We have a few conversations (I don’t remember them in the dream, I just know I’m in there having them). Then I leave and go back to the table. I’m worried now about what to say to my son because although I want to support him, I know there’s no way that I can learn to play this song in the short period of time that we have here. He is now at another table beside me and he’s talking to the people at it, and I totally don’t have time to talk to them. The frustration is starting to build. I can feel the anxiety in my body. Then the stage shifts from being an indoor one (like a school gymnasium) to an outdoor one where it's more like a circus or a fairground. It’s laid out like a long deck and it’s covered with this really attractive orange and blue and purple with a little bit of white in it fabric, like a canvas. Then the venue shifts a little - we still have this song we have to play, but now it’s more rock. So I say to him, “Let’s play “House of the Rising Sun” because you know how to sing that and I know how to play it by heart. I don’t need the book.” So he agrees and I agree. So now when our name is called, I’m relieved. I’m tuning my guitar on the walk up to the canvas covered outdoor stage now. I strike one chord and there’s bees. I see a bee on my son. I look down and there’s one on my leg. The person beside me says, “There’s a bee on your back!” I’m allergic to bees in real life, and apparently I am in the dream, too, because I start shaking my skirt and I’m trying to get it off me and I’m panicking because there’s a bee and I don’t want to get stung and I don’t have my epi-pen. That’s when I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

155,777,,26/01/2020,01/26/2020 00:03,"This dream is remembered in fragments. It’s a little disconnected in my memory. In one part, a group of us has set up a puja to Ganesh and the puja is set up outside of the temple because that’s where we’re supposed to do this particular service or worship. However, somebody has decided instead to take down this ceremony and move it to the inside of the temple and use the altar pieces, especially the altar cloth, that are meant for worship of Nataraj. To me it feels sacrilegious. There are people that live and work in the temple that are really not happy with this disrespect. The person who’s leading it doesn’t seem to really have any awareness of culture or tradition. Then there’s a girl next to this person who’s in charge of the ceremony and she’s wearing all white. This, too, is not correct. People are looking back and forth at each other commenting on it, and then she sort of stumbles over her words. So her mother, a few people down, tells her to have everybody turn around to face outside of the circle and take their pants off because it would be easier if they did that - easier for her to remember her words. So she tells everyone to do this and they do. I am looking at this nun and she’s a Buddhist nun and she’s really delightful. She has short hair and robes. I can see her face because it’s reflected in a mirror and she’s making all these delightful expressions - looking at people around her, lifting up her eyebrows and opening up her mouth in a big happy smile, then going back into a serious face. She seems a little bit odd to me. Then suddenly the scene shifts. She’s still there, but she’s the size of a fairy or gnome and she’s standing in the grass. She’s still making these delightful expressions. There’s another small person with her. Then, somebody finds a journal and it’s my journal. The last entry is from December 31, 2019. I start to fill it in. I write the date next to it, January 1, 2020. I can’t remember exactly what happened, but I’m trying to fill in information or entries from that point on. Then another scene: there’s a little boy and he comes up to me and we’re not really connected right now. He wants to be in the bed. I don’t want him in the bed. Then I take this apple and he bashes his head onto the apple and then this apple turns into some kind of vessel with holes and slices and cutouts and what not. Pooled in the bottom of the apple is this red liquid, like blood. It’s an elixir of some sort. So I lift this apple to his lips and he drinks it. It does something to his consciousness.

158,1302,,26/01/2020,01/26/2020 00:06,"“Forgiveness” In my dream I’m at the studio I’m trying to leave because of their lack of integrity and their manipulative behavior. There’s people - it’s almost like something has happened in the outside world and there’s refugees, just people that are lying in cots, like hospital bed cot in the studio. The studio is full of people. They’re not practicing yoga or anything - well, not in the physical sense, but they are in the spiritual sense. People are nursing other people. I’m not even sure what the wounds are because they’re not really obvious. But some people are not able to get up off the cot and other people are. So the “nursing” seems to be more on a spiritual level. So I’m involved with this and I’m just circulating among the people, soothing, easing, doing what I can. At one point somebody needs something, so like in dreamtime consciousness, the studio is all of a sudden larger than it actually is in real life. Hallways appear and I’m going down these hallways into empty offices that have been abandoned and looking for supplies. There’s a bit of an adventure where I don’t meet anyone, I’m just going down this labyrinth of hallways and checking to see if I can find things that will help other people and then bringing them back in, leaving them with someone else who will take care of the person while I go off and then hunt down something else that might be of use to someone else. After one of these trips, the person who seems to have the most issues - none of them are visual, I can’t see them bandaging bleeding wounds or anything, it’s just trying to get this person things so that they are able to have mobility again and get up off the cot. So this is where I’m entering into the busy studio atmosphere again where I see the owner - the one who has been manipulative and lied. She’s tending to this person and she has a completely different approach to what mine has been - she’s changed the approach of treatment so that all the things I have gathered, she’s now said won’t help and her idea of what will is now being accepted and used to tend to this person’s wounds. So I just look at that and think, “Well that figures, that’s something she would do.” Then I move on to see where else I’m needed. While I’m collecting up stuff that they’ve deemed unnecessary, I’m thinking how can I repurpose this in case someone else needs it. She goes back to her desk and makes an announcement like the way somebody at a toast would make some kind of noise to get everyone’s attention. So she does something and everyone’s looking at her and she says: “In honor of her service here, we have decided to give Freya 25% off of all the services we offer at the studio.” I’m like, “What?! What the hell?” Then everybody’s looking at me, so I have to go up and say thank you. As I do, I give her a hug. I feel like I’m forced to do this, but I don’t want to, I don’t even want her stupid 25% off. I don’t like the big deal she’s made out of this, so the whole way I’m feeling resistant. But as I hug her, I feel she is a skeleton underneath her sweater. She’s literally skin over bones. I have this moment of compassion for her where I feel through her body, her own journey has led her to do what she’s doing and in her own way, she’s helpful and she’s done this at a detriment to herself. I feel all this inner turmoil also going on in her. I feel sorry for her and I think I should forgive her for being who she is and I still don’t like it. So it’s like feeling forgiveness, compassion and resistance all at the same time. Then I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I can’t exactly see the people around me, but I know I like them and I know that where I am feels really good. I feel like I have purpose. I feel very open and excited to do it. I have two other work engagements and I’m not as excited about either of those, but I know it’s time for me to move to my second job, so I leave this light and bright place. I go into this hardware store that’s kind of dingy and smells metallic like hardware stores do with the little mix of oil. It’s very dim lighting with fluorescent lights over the top hanging low in the ceiling but only half of them work. I can’t tell exactly what I’m doing. I think I’m organizing nuts and bolts or cleaning something out. I know I’m greasy and dirty. The woman I’m working for, the owner, is there. She’s a mother and she has these two boys that aren’t hers but they’re in her care somehow. She also has a baby with her and at one point the baby is needing care and she has a fish she’s caught. The fish needs to be filleted and cooked and somehow I’m the one who knows how to do that. So I fillet the fish and I can see the individual muscles - the layers - the way a fish fillet is layered. The baby seems to be sickly and crying and is sitting in a carrier to my right. I fillet this fish and cook it and then take one of the layers off and give it to the baby to eat. This baby seems to be 5 or 6 months old, so it seems kind of strange that I’m giving it fish, but it seems to be what it needs. There’s this overall air of sadness and grief, like this baby is going to die anyway even if I give it this nourishing fish. Then I’m back speaking with the mother and she’s asking me to keep an eye on her two boys that aren’t really hers, but she’s taking care of. I go with the boys to her house. One boy goes in the house and stays in the house and one boy stays out. They’re twins and one is not allowed inside the house, the other is. The father doesn’t let the other one in. I’m watching the two of them and as I’m watching one boy cross over this threshold and the other stay behind, this group or gang of boys from the neighborhood come. They have some sort of laundry detergent or white powder they’ve picked up from the hardware store. They throw it into the eyes of both of the boys because neither of the boys are really the children of the family - that seems to be the reason anyway. The one boy who’s allowed in the house starts to cry and he’s screaming and he’s trying to clean the powder off his face. He gets taken care of - someone in the house takes care of him, washes his eyes out. The boy that’s not allowed in the house is crying and screaming and I go to take care of him. But I’m not allowed to take care of him. Someone else is taking him. And now some time has passed and I’m standing in the bedroom - it’s an upstairs bedroom. I’m looking out the window, and to my left is the boy allowed in the house. He’s on the bed and has bandages over his eyes. As I’m looking out this second or third story window, I’m looking out at this outdoor shed or barn and it has a huge human size cage hanging from it and the other boy is in it and his eyes are bandaged. It looks like they tried to make it comfortable for him to lay down, but it is a wire cage that’s rested. He’s lying down trying to convalesce. Then all of a sudden I remember I still never went to my third job, which was working for my mother, and I really don’t want to do that. She has been calling me this whole time reminding me that I owed her - that I was supposed to show up, that I’m supposed to be there, that I’m supposed to do this work for her. I would answer the call and talk to her, then put the phone down and promptly forget that I was supposed to be there. And now it’s time for me to go and I don’t go.

I can’t tell if it’s a sibling or one of my kids. We’re driving over the little bridge that used to grow across the stream - we called it the Y because the road splits into a Y right here. But the road was gone. It's just grass, then the stream and the road starts a little further ahead. I somehow manage to go fast enough to jump the little gap of stream and make it back onto the road. As I'm heading up I see that there’s a race or something going on and they actually have a place to just turn around. It seems like a lot of other cars have driven up this way, then realized they couldn’t continue. So we drive up to there and I turn around, but something about it feels uncomfortable like I should’ve known there was a race happening today or something. As I drive back and realize I have to go back over that little part of the stream where there’s no road, I’m getting worried because the gap seems much wider now and I don’t know if the van can make it across that gap. So I stop and get out and look. There’s a man sitting in a chair next to the road near the stream. He says, “You just have to go fast. You’ve got it.” But now somehow the van has turned into a bike maybe. I’m really nervous about jumping this gap, but I back up and do it anyway. It works, except when I land on the other side I notice my phone is gone and I can’t find it. The man in the chair says, “Oh it’s in the water.” Now I’m panicked because phones and water don't mix. But I pull it out of the water and it still seems to work, which makes me feel relieved. I take it, put it in my pocket, and instead of going home down the Y, we take the other path. It leads to a restaurant of sorts and we’re hungry and whoever’s with me wants to eat. We get to this restaurant and one of my highschool friends is there. She’s upset because they don’t have the food that she wants. It’s taking a really long time to get served and more and more people are showing up at this restaurant and we’re all ordering but it’s taking forever. We’re talking to each other and trying to pass the time, but at some point one of us says, “I think we should just go because we’re never going to get our food.” Right then the food starts coming out and it all starts coming out at the same time. Everyone gets served and I get served a piece of sushi, which doesn’t seem like very much because I’m hungry and it’s just one piece. But we all finish our meal and continue onto a gym where there’s basketball courts and workout equipment. It’s really important for us to be moving through this gym. There’s separate levels - the bottom level has weights, the next level has a basketball court. I remember climbing up the ladder to the second floor, but then we have to climb down a ladder and it’s really, really steep. One of my classmates instead of climbing down the ladder, takes a rope and pulls a full Tarzan move swinging from one platform to the next to get across this gap. I’m still on this ladder that is really, really steep and I have to go down, then across, then back up. I go down and it takes me a long time. It’s really scary. Then I get back up the other side and that’s no problem. Then we’re on this level that’s supposed to be basketball courts, but it turns out to be the daycare center and we’re all there to play basketball, but the basketball hoop is short - it’s a little kid basketball hoop. The whole dream is completely dissatisfying. I never get anywhere I’m supposed to be going. I never get the food I want to eat. I never get the workout I want to get.

Eventually, we identified a place which was perfect and decided to camp there. It had something to do with the hilly/mountainous terrain and possible the location or distance of nearby houses.   I remember that we hiked to the top of one of the mountains at night, but this time with my brother William and our mother. When we got to the top, we looked out at a large lake with a city on the other side. It was a beautiful view but something about it was off. I remember noting this in the dream but also that though it was off, the place or view was still worth it. We could also the see the stars above us at it was a clear night.",Bob,last_nights_dream2
166,1934,,28/01/2020,01/28/2020 00:05,"The dream started out with my being a detective attempting to track down a murder suspect. I was walking down a cobblestone road in the middle of the day when I came to a bridge. Someone dressed in red was there, and I think that it was a woman who had been killed by the murderer. As I was inspecting the crime scene, a police officer approached me and began questioning me as if I might be the murder. It was clear that I was one of their main suspects.  I left and planned to return to my house, but I realized that someone was after me and was going to prevent me from using my super power liquid which I had in a giant vat in my house. As I ran back to my house to get there first, I morphed into Peter Parker though I didn't have any of the powers of spider man. I remember going up to the second floor of the complex where my house or apartment was and entered my living room. It was dingy and filled with a yellowish light with a giant metal vat filled with bluish liquid. I had to enter this to gain my powers, but for some reason it wasn't working and I had to go out across the road to an abandoned lot where my other vat or portal was which gave me powers.  I jumped out of the window and landed lightly on the ground without injuring myself as I still had exceptional strength as a super hero. I was still being chased, so as I approached the second vat/portal, I grabbed a large stone, probably weighing 300lb and threw it at my pursuers to block off their path to me. This would not have worked as I don't remember being in a tight space, but for the purposes of the dream, it was effective.  I jumped through the portal or into the vat and found myself swimming through an ocean. The water was blue and I slowly rose to the surface. When I did I began swimming using the breast stroke and I noticed that I my hands in front of me were translucent. I could barely see them and could see the water behind them. I realized that I was dreaming at some level, and as I looked down I saw a black killer whale below me.   I began to wake up and for a moment I was both awake and dreaming as the room materialized and the dream vanished. For a few seconds I could still see the graininess of the real world as the dream faded. It was interesting to be fully aware at the moment of transition from sleep to wakefulness.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

We asked for rooms, possibly to sleep with prostitutes, but they were out of one or the other so Jared and I ended up staying in the same room by ourselves. We then made the decision that since there was no one else around, that one of us would have to pretend to be female so that the other could either have sex with them or just sleep lying next to/against them. I think the latter is the case. In any case, I had either chose or was designated to be the female, lay down in the same bed as Jared, and allowed him to hug me from behind.   At some point, I think that we realized that this was just incredibly awkward for both of us and that it was never going to work so we discontinued.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

The room is so full, but the frontdesk person allows me to go in with my son and there’s a table available for me right there. It’s super crowded, but I lay down and he comes over to me soon. He gives me this wild entrainment. I feel my body levitating off the table, twisting and shifting and moving in an awesome way and it feels amazing - the best experience I’ve ever had on the chiropractic table. I get up and I walk around and then his shift is over. So people start leaving and I wait because I want to thank him. So I wait to talk to him. We walk out together. I ask him how many tables he had set up. 10? No, 30! Then I try to find the frontdesk again to pay and it’s a little difficult to find, but I do. When I get there, I don’t have cash and I can’t seem to find my credit card, so there’s a moment when I’m wondering how I’m going to do this. Somehow it resolves and I’ll be on an honor system and pay them when I can - when I remember my card or can go back and get cash. Then I step outside and I see a huge eagle flying in the sky. Then the eagle spreads its wings really wide and starts to fly backwards with its spine perpendicular to the Earth. Then the eagle lands on a stage-like platform and seems to stand with its wings spread. He starts to do this ritual towards the sun, where he’s taking some of his feathers off and laying them on the ground in this ritual dance. I see there are two other eagles standing in formation with the first one. They’re all standing with their wings fully stretched out. It’s awe-inspiring.",Ana,last_nights_dream

171,1099,,30/01/2020,01/30/2020 00:01,"I’m in a house, it’s not one I recognize - two stories, pretty big, lots of bedrooms, sort of like a vacation rental Airbnb style. My entire family is there - mom, dad, grandma, 5 brothers and 1 sister. They’re maybe a few other people there, I’m not sure, but there’s this very obvious division of labor happening where it’s constantly the women in the kitchen making the meals and I’m starting to resent it and get really annoyed that I’m the one making dinners and cleaning up dinner for everyone. So we’re ready to have yet another meal and I just to start throw out a tantrum essentially and say no. There's a box of mac and cheese on the counter and I pick it up and slam it down in front of the men who are just sitting around the table. I tell them to make their own dinner. I’m feeling not just mad but also guilty for not wanting to make the meal or contribute, but my dad picks up the mac and cheese, then he goes to the fridge and looks at all the leftovers. He starts making a meal which he is perfectly capable of and actually very good at. But I’m still feeling angry and frustrated that it took me blowing up at everyone for someone else to make the meal. Then the scene changes and I’m in a crowd. We’re indoor/outdoor. The dreamscape is like we’re in a restaurant then at a theatre but then outside. I keep moving through places, but I’m watching this group of people. There’s about 9 of them and they’re entertaining. They’re split into two groups because one is going to do a song and then the other group is doing a song. Actually there’s three groups because there’s a third that’s directing and narrating this performance. So the narrators are speaking and the groups are getting ready to sing. The group that’s supposed to sing first is in the wrong position - the wrong spot on the stage. I’m concerned that people won’t do their lines or sing their songs correctly, but the groups are doing fine. The group that’s supposed to go first sings their song and there’s one member of that group that is very, very animated - they are all really, but he’s sort of stealing the show and he’s wearing a black bowler hat and his hair is dark, about shoulder length. Someone in this show that’s going on is a young baby off to the side, maybe a toddler, 1 or 2. It’s part of the show, but also in reality, it’s somebody’s baby that needs caretaking and no one is caretaking it except this man from the group in the black bowler hat. He’s singing about the baby and dancing around the baby and saying how he doesn't really want a baby but he’s in love with this one. It’s very strange and I’m not entirely sure what’s going on, but everyone in the crowd seems completely entertained and is clapping and laughing along. The baby is okay - not crying. Then the scene changes again and I’m outside on the steps of some building. I’m watching a scene that is happening across the street from me. There’s younger school aged children around 4 or 5 and they’re coming down a set of stairs. I watch as these two children who are just playing and not paying attention essentially launch themselves off the bottom two stairs and have this horrific crash. I’m so horrified because I see their necks go back as they go off the stairs and they land on their faces. I don't see a teacher around to help pick them up and make sure they’re okay. They sort of lay there for a while and I’m really worried, but this street between us seems to be a barrier I can’t cross to see if they’re alright. Then the dream fades out.",Rose,last_nights_dream

I have taken off my adornments and placed them at the top of the mat and they’re almost in Ursula's in space, so she gives me this look and so I in a really apologetic way move them over to the side and hide away in a bit of shame for that. Again I’m not able to stand in my true power and be myself in her presence. There's a direction from somewhere, someone telling us to remove our clothes. We are all wearing these beautiful silk flowing gowns. Nobody moves at first. It’s an odd direction and we don’t know where it’s coming from. Then Ursula who is across from me on a mat steps forward in this really seductive way starts to slip off her dress. Two women on either side who are studying with her are her attendants and they help her remove her gown and all of her underthings. Then everyone else proceeds to do so. I feel like, oh gosh I have to also and so I remove my outer gown, but I keep on my underwear because I haven’t waxed and I’m feeling pretty shameful about that. So I’m left wearing a black thong. Then I’m in a room and one of my husband’s friends is lying on a couch. He’s 7 feet tall - a really big guy - and he’s kind of joking around. He says something that agitates me. I climb up onto him and start to pound on him in a playful way. And I say, “You know I never really do this with anybody else, but you’re so big and it just seems okay to do this.” He’s laughing and he thinks it’s a funny thing, too. Then I’m in a building and I’m talking to this very wealthy man - a billionaire, creative person who I don’t know in waking life. My husband’s friend in the previous scene is also a very wealthy man. He’s talking about his vision for what he wants to create and bring me along with it. We are in a glass skyscraper type building and we see King Kong. King Kong is smashing buildings and it seems like he’s looking for this guy I’m with. He sees us through the window and comes toward us. We’re frantically trying to run away - run up the stairs or run down the stairs and get out of the building. And the building is crashing around us. I run downstairs into a hallway and I see an arrow pointing to a sign with a name - Beth. Beth is a friend of mine in town - she’s a counselor. So I see an arrow to her house and I run to find her. She’s there and she walks with me to the top of the stairs. She stays with my son in a stroller at the top of the stairs. I run down the stairs. I have to go to the bathroom. I end up in this Japanese style bathroom with all these automatic toilets that I have lights and sing songs. You’re supposed to go to the bathroom in a particular way and push the right buttons so it cleans you in a particular way.

179,1100,,31/01/2020,01/31/2020 00:07,"So many different dreams. I just remember fragments. The first one is just me and a priestess sister and some other people I know. We’re going on a journey. We have a covered wagon that we’re getting ready to travel with. It’s a long journey and rather perilous on the one hand, and on the other hand, there’s still modern things available to us. In the dream I go through the whole journey but I can only remember the ending part where we have gone everywhere we need to go and are sitting at a kitchen table trying to weigh out sliced oranges and green beans to feed another child and the scale won’t work. One of my priestess sisters is on a couch behind me and she’s getting scolded by someone for saying that she wants to do a certain thing but then not doing it. She kept saying that she wanted to wear bright orange and red colors, but she doesn’t do it. In the dream, I feel like it is a metaphor for her expressing some part of herself or turning on some part of her magic that she knows she wants but she just doesn’t. I’m listening to the whole thing in a kitchen - it’s a kitchen that’s been part of the journey. I’m worrying that the person that’s scolding her is going to come scold me. The person scolding her sounds like James Earl Jones, he’s like a big black man with a lot of gravitas and authority and power. I’m nervous he’s going to come over and start telling me what I'm not doing right. Then the scene changes. We’re back on the covered wagon again and heading home, back to where we started from. We get there and there’s a huge barn (it reminds me of a barn raising, but the barn has already been built). Everyone’s getting ready to dance. It’s a weird mix of olden times where the women are wearing white caps on their heads and have these long full skirts and then some of them aren’t - some of them are dressed in club clothes, like they are going to a rave. Some of the participants I know from when I did Olympic weight lifting at my old gym. It’s a very strange mix of people. I’m still watching all of it. People are saying hello and welcome back from your journey, but there’s a part of me that’s very much the observer and not in the celebrations that are happening. I don’t know if it’s a wedding or just a party. There’s something going on. This fragment ends and the next fragment I remember is: a man is calling me on my phone. I had had a healing from him the night before. He calls me and says, “Hello, this is Michael. Your healing was very interesting today. I put together a video for you to watch of what I healed.” But his connection is crappy and the video keeps freezing and I don’t get to see all the pieces. He recognizes this and says, “Oh, I can see that the video won’t play. Let me just tell you.” Then he tells me, but of course now I can’t remember what he said! He had done the healing and things had come up and I was very surprised that he called me because I was supposed to call him. He was trying to emphasize that the healing was very significant, very interesting, and that I really needed to know and he wasn’t going to wait for me to call him. Then the scene switches again and I’m in another fragment of a dream. This time I’m riding in a vehicle and I’m watching a woman in front of me who is biking. She’s doing a long distance bike because she has big saddlebags and she has her dog with her. Something happens to the dog - she has to feed it or it gets something in its paw - and she has to stop and tend it. It’s a big black dog with curly hair. She spends a lot of time making sure the dog is okay - I think it is. The surroundings around us are so strange. It’s like the road is lifted up and elevated. Sometimes it’s sand on either side, sometimes it’s water, sometimes there’s a palm tree. It’s totally blue skies. It’s completely clear. It seems like some sort of paradise place, but there’s not a lot of greenery. It’s almost like it’s not part of this realm and it’s really important for this woman to take care of her dog and it’s super important for me to witness it and I do not know why.",Rose,last_nights_dream

Some of them are dressed as servers who are working this banquet dinner. Some of them are dressed as guests. The sense I’m getting is that they have something up their sleeve. They’re planning to do something and there’s definitely magic involved. I keep seeing little flashes or vignettes of little scenes where something is a little out of place and the thing that’s out of place has a red color and everything else in the background is its normal color. I’m not quite understanding everything I’m seeing, but I know that each of these little vignettes I see, one thing is going to trigger the next thing and it will be a sequence of events that creates this magic. I don’t even know what it is - it’s just something that’s supposed to impact the way this auction dinner is going. This is taking up quite a bit of my attention until the Latino man on my left who has dark short cropped black hair, dark skin and a 5 o’clock shadow where I can see he has shaved but it’s not smoothe...He’s a little older than I am and he has leaned over to get my attention. He’s leaning over my left shoulder and it feels like his upper body is almost in my lap, but he’s still being very respectful, it’s not a pushy way, he just really is trying to get my attention. He says that he will protect me and love me no matter what, which I find a little unnerving because I don’t know who he is. This scene ends and it cuts away to me driving a car.

So I’m relating this story of my friend and I’m asking her what she thinks of it. She’s telling me that yes it was somewhat strange behavior but I could actually trust this man and I remember thinking, well, trust him or not, I don’t know why he said he was going to love me. There was no chemical attraction there at all. I just felt baffled by his behavior.

There were four kids in that family and one of them is my ex-best friend. The kids are hiding things from the parents. They go through this process of scurrying around and putting away stuff they’ve been using so that when the mom comes downstairs she won’t be aware of what they’ve actually been doing. I’m feeling uncomfortable with all of this and with some of the things they’re hiding, I’m thinking, “Why are you even hiding that? It’s just a book.” I didn’t understand the process of hiding, but it seems to be an integrative activity among the kids in the family. Then the dream shifts to a decade later. I’m still a teenager in it, though, and I’ve moved out of their house but I’ve gone back for a visit. There’s the daughter who is my ex-best friend. She has removed a piece of paneling from the wall and there’s stuff in it. I notice her going through it. I’m looking at what she’s brought out. I see a couple things and I’m like, “Oh! That was mine! I don’t remember hiding that and I didn’t even notice I was missing it.” So in the dream, we’re still not talking to each other and I go pick out my things that are in it. She takes her things away somewhere and she just kind of disappears. Then I don’t know what to do with mine. I guess I don’t have any pockets. I can’t seem to think in the dream, “Oh why don’t I just take them with me?” Now I’m encumbered with the idea that the mom can’t see it and I’ve come here to visit her. So I put them back in the wall and put the paneling over top of it. The mom comes downstairs and we have a visit. Then my ex-best friend reappears and she says, “Mom, Freya’s been hiding things in the wall.” Then the mom comes over and removes the piece of paneling and sees that and she’s really disappointed in me that I’ve hidden some things and meanwhile, my ex-best friend has already removed hers and completely set me up. Then I’m thinking I don’t even remember hiding that stuff. It was involved in the hiding activities that the kids were doing when I lived here and I’m thinking I didn't put that stuff in there, she just took it and set it up to make it look like I did to shed some negative light on the positive relationship I still had with her mom.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream2

You stood on the ride, held onto a wooden piece on runners, and you ran behind it holding on for balance. It went faster and faster until it far exceeded normal running speeds. The track also turned frequently so that one would be constantly hitting up against the wooden rails on the sides of the track.   As I spun around, faster, and faster, it was clear that I had more experience than Harold at doing this as he was falling behind.

Everyone was lined up against a white cinder block wall and I told them to split up with boys on the left and girls on the right. I began to question whether this was a politically correct move to make, and all of a sudden, I was looking at a mental picture of little Anime-like male and female figures as they reorganized themselves against a blank white background. But there was at least one student who was transgender and looked neither male nor female and was flitting between one side and the other unsure of where to go.  I then picked a different system using tiles on the wall above the students. It was split from left to right with each side having 2 tiles vertically and 5 tiles horizontally. Each one had a picture of a student on it.  One of the students, I believe a female black student with long hair was being rebellious and not taking her place or moving to and fro within her apace.

207,1305,,06/02/2020,02/06/2020 00:02,"“The Wounded Masculine” The scene opens up and it’s a familiar scene. I frequently dream where I’m in settings with some kind of academic flavor to them and they’re set near the water (that’s me being the academic bookwork that I am and also the ocean, lake loving Cancer/Scorpio combination that I am). Here we are in some kind of academic building. It’s packed, there’s lots of people around. I hang out mostly with these two guys. One of them I'm going to call J.C. and the other one I’m going to call him Brandon. They’re always in the vicinity of me, so we have lots of conversations. I think the conversations are platonic because they don’t hold any other kind of frequency for me. We talk a lot about politics and whatever is going on in the school in terms of administration and we analyze a lot of things, or we just have friendly banter. I also eat with them during breaks. So it’s not unusual for me to be asked to eat outside. So this one day, J.C. asks me if I want to take my lunch outside and I say, “Yeah sure, that would be great.” So we bring our lunches with us. We go down and sit on a bench by the lake. There's this large family of some kind of Asian culture because the language they’re speaking is unfamiliar and I think it sounds like it’s some kind of Asian dialect. Then I realize we are the only two people not speaking some other kind of dialect. I start to voice this to him and he’s looking at a baby who’s sitting. One of the parents has sat the baby wearing just a cloth diaper in two inches of water further up on the beach. There’s some beautifully colored shells that the baby is playing with and he’s just watching the baby. I go up and kneel on the sand by the baby and just feel the water around my legs and feet. I still remember the air smelled so good and so fresh. I’m just watching the baby, as well. Then lunch is over, so he reaches down to help me up because I’ve been kneeling. He just extends his hand out and says we have to go in, so I reach out and take his hand. He helps me up. But then he doesn’t let go of my hand. We start walking and I remember thinking, “Wow, it feels really nice to hold somebody’s hand and just have that affection.” Then my psyche slowly starts to clue in that this is no longer platonic and I don’t feel that way about him. So I’m thinking how do I word this to ask him if he just likes holding hands (because it does feel really nice, but you need to know what the other person’s expectation is - is he thinking this is more romantic than platonic). While I’m thinking about how I should word this, he starts talking to me and it’s in a different language and I can’t understand a word that he’s saying. At this point my other friend, Brandon comes up and he’s on the other side of J.C.. Brandon is listening because normally it’s the three of us hanging out and he’s nodding his head. I’m thinking, “Wow, he understands what J.C. is saying and I do not. What is happening here?” Then we arrive back at the school. We’re taking our jackets off. He’s collecting what he needs to teach his class. I’m just standing there kind of dumbfounded. At this point, his eyes are glazed over, so there’s no body language or any communication of any sort that’s coming through him to me. Then he exits. I look over and say to Brandon, “Did you understand what he was saying?” And he says, “No, not a word.” Okay, I’m relieved. I’m glad I’m not the only one. The scene shifts. After I’ve taught my class, I come out and there’s some kind of university-wide family day picnic. My family has arrived as well as the families of some other people. This time we go out the back of the building. The front of the building faces the water and the back of the building faces some grassland. There’s also areas at the back, so doors open there that have cupboards and closets and places where there are tools and things that you would need to fix any kind of large building on site. So people are bringing in their potluck items that they have to share and they’re storing them away. There’s a hive of activity and there’s other people setting up ball areas. They’re tying ribbons to trees and making it look really festive. There’s little sports equipment things you can carry in a bag that will interest the younger kids for a day. There’s a lot of colored floaty balls around. I’m with my own kids - it’s weird, I’ve got two boys and my daughter. I’m talking at a picnic table with some men. One of them starts saying that he misses his wife. I know she’s over there with their kids - they have quite a few kids - so, I’m puzzled by his remark. He says, “Yeah, I don't know where my place is in her life anymore. She’s so focused on the kids and she has some new friends that we weren’t friends with before we had family. And she does things with them that I’m not included with and I don’t know what my role is with that anymore.” I notice that he’s started drinking and I think wow, this man doesn’t usually drink alcohol. His speech is starting to get slower and he’s eaten something that’s stringy and is actually hanging from his mouth and some of it is on my arm. I’m looking down and feeling disgusted. At the same time I’m feeling rather sorry for him. So I go into one of the tool sheds to clean up with and when I come out he’s gone. As I look around at the social groupings of the family, I see that the men are all standing up and the women are sitting down, busy, and involved in conversation and interaction with the families. But the men are standing talking to each other, but removed from the hum of interaction that’s happening at this gathering. Then the dream ends with one of my boys coming up to me and saying he needs some special kind of rock salt. So I go in and get some out of the janitor’s closet and give it to him. I ask him what he needs it for, because I’m sure he’s not going to use it all up. He says he’ll bring the container back when he’s done.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

The people that have come in for yoga have intentionally come for the class. However, I’m unable to organize them. The time I’m supposed to start the class, they’re still talking to each other. It’s like they can’t hear me. It’s like trying to shepherd chickens. They’re running all over the place. I’m trying to get their attention and I’m trying to teach. As soon as I get them organized with their mats down, I say about six words and they’ll wander off again or start talking to each other or look at something from a window that’s in the mall. At one point, out of frustration, there’s a carny with a headset on. I walk over and say to them, “I notice you’re not using your headset right now. Is it okay if I borrow it?” He says, “Okay, that’s fine.” So I put it on. He shows me how to use it and I walk back over. It works for about 6 seconds. Then the class is the same.

212,1307,,08/02/2020,02/08/2020 00:02,"“The Altar” In this dream, I’m living in a large house - it’s an older farmhouse and it’s surrounded by forest. The architecture is intricate and beautiful - almost like a mini castle. In my dream, I do not go in the house. The dream occurs outside the house. Imagine standing on the front porch of that house looking forward and you’re surrounded by an arc of tables. The middle of the arc extends outwards from the house and the two ends wrap around the outside to where the beam for the house would be. The tables are eclectic - there’s all different kinds and shapes that create this arc. I am involved with arranging things on the tables. Each table tells its own story and so do the objects on it. The dream begins where I’ve already set up and created the stories on all tables except this one that I am struggling with to bring into the arc so that it doesn’t stick out in some unseemly way from the general shape the tables are creating together. I’m a little frazzled because I can’t get the table to move. It’s stuck somehow. I’m also under some kind of time crunch where I need to meet with someone else, a friend, A.T. We are to go to this other ceremony that’s a type of reunion. So it’s time to go and I have to leave the table where it is, standing off like an unabsorbed cell. I meet A.T. and we are dressed for the ceremony. We walk over to it. The ceremony is some kind of presentation of some kind of award, but I never pay attention to it because my interactions are on the outside of that. In the group of people, each one is someone I haven’t seen in a really long time. We have some conversations. I realize that I am needed back at the arc at this table. I can’t stay for as many of the conversations as I would like to. So I feel that i’m unable to be absorbed into the interactions of that crowd at this ceremony as I would like because my duties required back at the house are calling me. As I say my goodbyes I’m making my way back to the house, I realize that I do need to get this table integrated with the arc of the other tables because once it is, I will be moving onto something else. Again, I’m struggling with the table and my friend, A.T. is supposed to be with me, but she’s still lingering back at the other ceremony and I’m slightly irritated by her tardiness. She’s supposed to be helping me and here I am waiting for her and now I’m starting to get anxious that I’m going to miss the entry into this next realm because she’s late. But she shows up at the last minute. We still have to get changed. We need to wear different things to move into this other realm. We manage that. I go back into the house and do that. I dash in, change clothes and then come back out. I get the table integrated into the arc and I put some things on it. The items are furry. They speak of a time that is much earlier than the time I’m in and by placing them on the table, I’m transported back into the time they came from. My friend does move with me through this portal, but then she goes off to whatever she’s supposed to be doing here and it’s not what I am doing. The physical setting here is made of stone - like a stone doorway with a lot of different stones making up a mound and there’s simply a space between them where I exit out of. There’s stones along the right hand side of me and I touch them. There’s kind of thorny things growing up along the other side and wrapping over my head. The brush here is very dense. I’m following the only path I can as I cannot go off the left because the thorns are too thick. It slopes downwards and I enter into a small clearing and there’s some other people there. They’re dressed in furs and they’ve got skins wrapped around their feet. They’re aware of me, but they don’t interact with me. I’m to set things out on a stone tablet there - some items for them. But we don’t speak the same language and I can’t describe to them what I’m doing, but I sense they’re waiting for me to do it. In order to achieve that, I need to make contact with someone else. I’m looking around for him. Then I do suddenly see him and he sees me. I reach out and I make sure that I take his hand slow enough that the other people are aware that we’ve made contact because that will put them at ease and it will also show them that I have some kind of power. So we do this and I pull him in with me back up the hill to where the clearing was, which is where I entered this realm. We lie down together and embrace. It felt really nice - I remember that feeling. The items we were supposed to lay out on the flat piece of stone - we do that and then I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I’m al ittle panicked because I don’t want to be sprayed. So I start walking away slowly so as not to startle it, but definitely to get away, and the skunk follows me. It’s interesting, instead of a white stripe on top of the skunk’s head, the white is in the shape of a heart. It keeps following me. I’m trying very calmly to get away from it, but it’s acting like a dog and really just wants my attention. So I slow down and let it sniff me, again trying not to move too quickly so it doesn’t spray me. I figure it’s done and begin to walk away. Again it follows me and goes up on its hind legs and puts its front legs on my leg like a dog would do just saying hi. Despite myself, I’m becoming quite fond of this skunk who seems to want my attention with the heart-shaped stripe on its head. But I’m still super concerned it’s going to spray on me. I actually see it lift its leg and I’m worried that it has and I just haven’t smelt it yet, but whether or not the skunk has sprayed I don't know because I can’t smell anything. The animal is just hanging around. I move on. I go to do some other thing, figuring it will follow me or not, and it does. It wanders off and goes and does its thing and then comes back. So it’s acting very much like a dog and there's still this thought in the back of my mind that it’s going to spray me, but it doesn’t. It’s very curious and it seems that now I have a skunk as a pet. And then the dream shifts. I’m in an outdoor place of some sort. There’s a lot of people gathered and my old olympic lifting coach is there and he’s juggling. He’s got a crowd around him and he’s doing these crazy moves with juggling pins including catching them while he’s upside down and then doing cartwheels. I’m thinking it’s very strange because as an olympic lifter he wasn’t incredibly agile in this way, although strong, but not known to be doing acrobatics. Then my attention is drawn elsewhere. I see a friend of mine and her partner. They’re doing some sort of performance but I can’t quite tell what it is, I can’t see what they’re doing but it’s her partner who is at the center of attention. Now the scene shifts from this outdoor space to inside. I’m sitting with a group of other people behind a computer. This friend of mine and her partner are doing a video webinar. They are giving their talk, but they are at the part of the webinar where they’re giving questions for people to do - some self reflection - and they’re also giving some survey questions for us to answer about how the talk went. I’m concentrating really hard to write an answer but I can’t remember what I wrote or exactly what the question was. I’m just seeing letters typing onto a screen.

She says yes, but it seems like her answer is a little bit reluctant. The coffee shop is very busy and it’s not very big, there’s not a lot of space. She’s rushing around quite a bit. So I take her reluctance as bad timing on my end because I’m asking her while she’s busy, and it’s not that she doesn’t want to hang out. The scene changes and I’m in a residential area of a town and I’m walking to meet this friend. The houses are cute - they look like Victorian era houses with wrought-iron fences and gates and lots of English style gardens with roses. I’m walking up a hill and she’s standing halfway up the hill outside a house that has an archway with roses growing over it - like a trellis. I meet her but that reluctance on her end is actually still there and now I’m thinking that she actually did not want to meet with me. She’s just doing it to be nice, which makes me feel awkward. But I go along with it anyway and say hello. It’s dark. It’s not quite nighttime, but the sun is not out. It’s twilight heading into the dark. She turns up the hill and I follow her. We head towards a river or a canal. We actually get into a boat - like those boats in Venice - and start paddling a little bit. There is a boat in front of us and it has a bunch of people in it. I don’t know them, but she seems to know them and she wants to keep up with them. These are her friends that she would rather be with. For whatever reason, instead of calling to them or following them in our boat, we get out of our boat, into the water, and try to swim towards them. They’re moving way faster than we are and I see that the canal up ahead has a turn in it and I see the boat with all the people in it go around that turn and disappear and we are still swimming, trying to catch up with them. It doesn’t make any sense because clearly we are not going to catch up with them. We swim for a little bit longer and we eventually get out. Somehow I’m not cold even though it seems like I should be cold. We go into this building that we start to explore. It’s dark in the building. The floors are wood. It looks quite neglected - there’s cobwebs in the corners and dust on the floor. We walk up the stairs to the second level where there’s some sort of ice cream machine spitting out three different flavors and she wants to try them, but I’m a little bit wary because there’s a man or someone who looks kind of like the fortune teller from that movie, Big Small with Tom Hanks in it - it looks kind of carnival like that. This man thing is dishing up the ice cream, but I really don’t want any of it because it just seems super odd and strange and I don’t trust it at all. Then the scene changes completely and I’m outside. I can see mountains. The mountains are huge. It’s actually another sort of twilight, but it’s different - there are more blues in this twilight, it’s not quite as dark. An ex-boyfriend from twenty years ago is there. I’m not overjoyed to see him or anything, but it’s cordial. Suddenly he’s talking to me like we’re still lovers. I’m a little bit confused because I would not ever do that again and I have a voice ringing in my head saying, “Don’t settle, don’t settle, don’t settle.” The voice is also telling me, “You can still be kind, you can still be kind.” So this ex-boyfriend is wanting to be my partner. I can tell he’s trying to be affectionate with me. So I am modifying my own behavior to be kind and loving and affectionate and really encouraging. He wants to go surfing and he’s going to take me with him. So we’ve been outside the whole time and I can see these mountains, but there’s also a building behind us. We go into the building. It’s where he lives. He has an apartment. He’s very very familiar with me and I’m trying to maintain a loving compassionate and kind boundary, not of pity or anything, but out of encouragement. The main theme is me encouraging him to do what he wants to do because now his father has shown up to the apartment and wants to take him surfing. He’s a surfer and he’s incredibly excited about surfing. He has to leave to do it and he’s going to leave me here. He seems to feel bad about leaving me, but I’m actually quite glad that he’s going. So again, I’m being as encouraging as possible. I’m giving him hugs, but stopping him when he wants to kiss me because I don’t want him to. In his mind, it seems like we are a couple and going to be together for a while and I’m just sending him off for a little bit and then he’ll be back. But in my mind I’m sending him off like he’s going off on a quest and I won't’ see him for a long while. I’m relieved that I wont’ see him. The dream ends with him showing me some sort of book or picture that he’s really proud of. I’m again encouraging or congratulating him and telling him how wonderful he is and that he’s going to meet somebody else. He seems satisfied with that and happy. I’m satisfied with how I’ve handled all of it.",Rose,last_nights_dream
217,1308,,10/02/2020,02/10/2020 00:02,"“The Toothbrush” In this dream, I am on my way to a concert in Toronto. I’m with a couple friends - one is a friend of mine, A.G., and the other is my first boyfriend for a little while in high school. We’ll call him Daren. So in this dream, I’m with A.G. and Daren. and we’re on our way to a concert. We stop at his parent’s place which isn’t where his parents actually lived. It’s in a city called Burlington and they’re living on Plains Rd. The house is really dense on the inside. It’s like a hoarder house where you can’t walk through the hallways. You can’t see what’s on the other end of the hallways. They have all these pets that they’re constantly looking for because they can’t find them in all this hoarding mess. So we arrive there and I guess we have to stay overnight. We’ve arrived late and the concert is the next day in the afternoon, so we’ve decided to go and sleep there because it’s closer to leave from his parents’ place. When we get there, his mom is looking for one of the pets - it’s this weird amalgamation of a dog and a cat. At first I think it’s a dog but when I look more closely at it, it has the body of a cat and the neck and head of a dog. We see it for a moment and then it’s gone again. So all of us are trying to squeeze our way through this house. It seems like in the dream I’m doing this without any contact from anyone else for what feels like hours. Then I come out into the kitchen and I see Daren and I ask him if he’s had any luck. He says, “Not yet, but there’s this whole other half of the house I haven’t checked.” I don’t say this outloud but I’m thinking, “Wow, this house is so much bigger than it appears to be because of all the stuff.” So we start off together into the doorway through the other side of the house. It’s like the air in there is colder - the way it would feel if you were going down in altitude into a cave where it just feels damper and colder, but it still has stuff in it. I can’t see anything. I see this other creature. It’s a combination of a hedgehog and a guinea pig. It walks past me and Daren says to me, “Make sure you don’t let that guy out.” I look and suddenly realize there’s a pocket door I could close, so I do. The little creature stays in there. We get out of this next hallway and his mom and dad are sitting in the next clearing. Daren tells them that he hasn’t been able to find the dog. Then I look over and I say, “Is that it?” It’s partially masked by some other thing and I can’t even figure out what this creature is. It’s black and it has limbs, but there’s no discernable face on it. Daren says, “Yes that’s it!” And he goes over and gets it and picks it up and takes it to his mom. They’re so happy and patting it. I leave them there and see there’s a door behind the dad which actually has daylight. I decide to leave out that door, walk all the way around and come in the other door we entered in. It’s a measure of avoiding all these cluttered passages. So I do that and when I come in, my friend is trying to kiss Daren and I’m thinking to myself, “That’s very strange behavior for her and awkward!” But he pulls back and walks over. Now I have a cup of tea in my hand and I’m sitting at a table and I see that his eyes are actually filling up with tears. He’s upset that she did that. I say, “Well, why didn’t you tell her? You should have said something.” He says, “I don’t want to ruin this for everyone.” I say, “Well I’ll go over and say something” He tells me not to for the same reason - it will ruin this event. I’m sitting with this and thinking that it’s kind of ruined anyway. It’s awkward and with no one talking about it, it will just sit there and fester. Then he says, “Are you ready to go?” I say, “What? No! I haven’t even finished my tea.” I realize that when I came in, I had a toothbrush and I brushed my teeth in the bathroom. I can’t figure out how to get through all these hallways with the clutter to go back and check the bathroom. I look through my suitcase which is just a little carry case like a backpack with a whole bunch of zippers. I’m opening all the zippers and looking in each compartment and it looks like it has my belongings in it, but each zippered compartment is empty. There's no toothbrush and I tell him I don’t want to leave without brushing my teeth. He does the eye roll thing, “You better hurry up, I don’t want to be late.” So the rest of the dream I’m lifting up things and looking underneath them, trying to find my toothbrush.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

219,781,,11/02/2020,02/11/2020 00:01,"The setting for this dream is Esalen and it is my dream Esalen rather than the waking world Esalen. It’s a place I have gone to many times in my dream world in the past, so it’s very familiar to me. Every time I go, I also notice how they’ve done some construction - they’ve built a new building or there are different garden features, farm features, whatnot. The way we get there is my husband is driving the RV and we have picked up another person in the RV. She’s a woman, probably in her late 60’s or early 70’s. We are coming up with a route and my husband has the map out. He's drawing all these different possibilities and trying to figure out how to get the RV to our destination. It’s difficult because the RV is big and there are narrow roads and some deadends, turnarounds and other things that make it more challenging to drive this 40 foot vehicle. We end up at Esalen and drive off the side of the road and park with half of our wheels in the farm dirt. A man comes up and he says, “That’s fine, don’t worry about it.” We leave the RV, get out and start walking. I end up leaving everybody else and going to the food hall. They’ve just finished serving lunch, so there’s leftovers. We haven’t paid to be there, so I sneak in and see there are basketfuls of platefuls of bannocks, buttery oat savory and sweet cakes. I start stuffing my face because they are so good and there are so many different flavors. I want one of everything. Other people are coming around and eating one or two. I’m thoroughly enjoying it, but also worried that somebody is going to come up to me and say, hey, you need to pay or you're not a registered guest, and because you have eaten these without paying, now you have to pay this huge fee. But nobody does. So I walk out and apparently my husband has been looking for me. We go up to our room, so I guess we have a room. It’s on the third story. My son is playing in the sink, but there’s something wrong with the sink so it starts filling up with water. We turn off the faucet just in time and then my husband wants to figure out what’s going on with it. So he removes the basin and puts it on the floor. I can look down through that hole and see a line of basins - so I guess it’s like a dormitory or a hotel where every room is in the same orientation with a private bath. So I can see all the way across, sink after sink after sink basin showing through the floor. Then I can look down and see down three stories to the bottom floor. I’m worried because My son is there and I don’t want him to fall down to the ground.",Ana,last_nights_dream

221,1104,,12/02/2020,02/12/2020 00:01,"I’m outside. There’s a couch that looks like a bench style car seat that’s been taken out of a car. Someone is carrying me because I have an injured leg - I can’t tell if it’s my ankle or foot, but I don’t walk very well. Someone has been carrying me and they’ve set me down on this bench and I’m facing what looks like a really big store that reminds me of a Dollar Store or Big Lots warehouse type building. There’s all kinds of weird things in it, definitely nothing I would buy. It’s all plastic and seems like junk. There’s this young woman who’s working. She actually reminds me of a very feisty astrologer I know and I’m surprised she’s working at this place because she also does not approve of plastica and crap. But she’s there and I get up and hobble over. I still can’t tell what’s wrong and am not even sure what foot it is. I don’t seem to be in a lot of pain, I just don’t walk normally. I start to wander around and it smells kind of musty in this place. I walk through the glass doors and it’s dim inside. I wander through and there’s a section of Easter things - stuff you’d put in Easter baskets. She points out these little hologram hanging mobiles that I’ve seen in stores like Joann’s before. The one she shows me is a cartoon character of a fairy. She says, “Oh I think your kids would like that.” I get up and look at it. It’s cute, it’s interesting, but I’m not going to buy anything that’s plastic, even if it’s from the Dollar Store. I tell her, “Yeah, but I think my kids are too old for fairies.” Then the scene around me shifts and I’m still in a really big warehouse, but now it’s empty and the floor is dirt - it’s not a concrete floor. There’s a bike race being put on and it’s twilight outside. In the dream before it was sunlight outside and just dim inside the store. Now it’s getting dark, towards twilight. There’s a bike race going on. Somehow even though I have this injured foot or leg, I’m part of the race. The bike I have has those super skinny narrow tires like road bikes, but this is a mountain biking trail - there’s dirt and rocks everywhere. As I’m riding through, there’s a ton of other riders, all men and they’re all going really fast. I’m concerned - I’m thinking that I’m not in very good shape and I have this injury. But for whatever reason, I seem to be keeping up with them as we’re biking through this really rocky terrain. I’ve been on the edge the entire time of the race, so I’m on the side of the road, but more people are packed in the middle. I keep riding under juniper and pine trees and I keep getting branches, twigs, juniper berries, pine cones and pine needles in my hair. But I keep riding and I’m having a good time. It’s not too intense, except there’s a little fear that I’ll crash, but I don’t. Somehow I get out ahead of everyone with the exception of one man who is keeping me paced. It’s almost as if the crowd behind us, even though they’re pushing their hardest, are making space for the two of us to ride out in front. The ending of the race is back at this warehouse building we started at. I pull up and into the house dirt parking lot and make a big circle, having just won. The other man that was even with me won also, and I can’t tell which of us actually came in first. But it doesn’t seem to matter because everyone is cheering us on. I’m the only female that had been riding in the race. There are other women on the sidelines cheering, however, just one or two. There was not a huge crowd for this entire race. Then the race is over and people go wherever they’re going, celebrating and drinking beer. I walk back into this warehouse where there’s a woman with her young toddler. The owner of the warehouse is also there. All of the hubbub about the race is over. She seems to be planning another larger event. While she’s planning it, a gigantic electric bucket truck pulls up and pulls into the warehouse. It’s huge - the size of one of those extra long big mobile homes. The men come out of it and start talking to the owner of the building, telling him that he has to be careful where he gets his power from. The man who won the race with me is there. He seems to be in support of me and the owner. He’s talking to these electric people. We’re all kind of wary because they seem very oppressive - like they have the power to turn everything off. So the man that won the bicycle race is speaking with them very intelligently - he has all the facts. The owner of the building doesn't like where all this is going, but he’s letting this man schmooze these electrical engineer guys who are wanting to control the way he is bringing power to his building. Then the scene changes completely and I'm with a friend of mine who is in the middle of a CrossFit competition. The weights they are asking her to lift are incredibly heavy for a woman. She’s still managing to do it, but I’m pissed off at the weigh they sprung on her without any warning. She does it and she finishes her workout and comes off the competition floor and she’s completely spent. All of her strength, all of her energy is gone and she doesn’t have anything left for the upcoming competitions and she's looking at me with this absolutely pissed off face as if it was somehow my fault that the weight was so heavy. I’m sort of her manager and protecting her in some way and she asks me where her dog is. It was my responsibility to make sure that her dog had been taken care of this whole time. I tell her dog is in another country - in the last country we had been in where she was doing one of these competitions - and the dog is fine and she doesn’t need to worry. But she’s still really mad at me and I can’t tell if it's the combination of having done this really crazy lift workout and her being really tired, or if she doesn't trust that I didn’t take care of the dog. Either way, it’s really frustrating on my end because I’m trying really hard to explain to her that her dog is safe. Somehow I know the dog is white and completely safe and she’s okay, and we can walk away from this weird CrossFit competition and everything will be okay and we can go gather her dog.",Rose,last_nights_dream
222,1309,,12/02/2020,02/12/2020 00:02,"“The Sandbox'' In this odd mix of imagery and people, I find myself in a large two-story house with various people that I know from my extended family and where I currently work. The dream begins with C.R. from work and she’s been given the responsibility of taking care of two babies - one is about 10 months, almost ready to walk but not ready walking independently, and one can’t be anymore than 9 months older, not even two and he’s male. Later on in the dream when I ask what the children’s names are, someone tells me that the younger one is named Stacey and the older one is Alexander. So she’s taking care of them and I see her bring the babies out of a room and wonder if maybe they’ve just been bathed because they’re naked. She lays the younger one down on the rug beside the railing. The older one is standing. She tells them to stay there while she goes into a different room and gets diapers. I’m coming out of another room and I see them there and think, “Why is she laying them there? It’s really close to the stairs.” I’m thinking that the younger one can roll and fall down the stairs. I start to move towards that child and at the same time, she rolls and goes all the way down the stairs face first! I’m just horrified and thinking, “Oh my god!” She lands at the bottom and C.R. comes out of the room carrying the diapers, picks her up, and she’s okay! She carries her back upstairs and says, “Here can you hold her?” So, I do. I’m standing there with a naked baby on my hip. I’m looking at her and thinking, “Don’t you pee on me!” And that’s when I ask, “Whose children are these and what are their names?” Someone comes up to me and says the younger one is Stacey, the older one is Alexander. They belong to someone, but the name is muffled so I can’t understand what it is. That person isn’t there right now. Now the scenery that evolves around me is a kitchen. I’m standing there and there's people at the table. I see my stepmom’s brother and sister-in-law who’ve been very kind to me throughout my life. My aunt has a natal wheel in her hand and she says to me (I’m still holding this kid on my hip), “Is it possible that each year on my birthday, the aspects will move into a different house?” I reply to her and say, “Yes, because they move one degree ahead each year. I say, “So if you have any aspects that are in the 29th degree of something last year, then this year, they’ll be at the 30th degree, so it’s on the cusp. Or if they were on the 30th last year they’ll be in the first degree the next one, so they’ll be all the way in a different house. What have you got there?” She shows me her natal wheel and I say, “Oh look, you’ve got something that’s just moved into this house, which is ruled by Libra.” So she’s studying her chart and she’s absorbed by this. Then the kitchen suddenly expands and there’s a long dining room like my grandparents used to have. There’s a long table that seats 14 or 18 people and it’s set for dinner and there's chairs and whatnot. People start carrying dishes that they’ve prepared in the kitchen and they’re setting them out on the table. I’m vaguely aware that this is my extended family and the gathering is because it’s my aunt’s birthday. But at the same time, the children have been picked up by whoever owns them and I’m no longer carrying the one on my hip. Then, there’s this wooden small sandbox beside me. It’s a square box and made of plywood. It has a divider in it in the middle that divides the sandbox into 4 equal parts filled with sand. Another friend that I’ve recently starting talking to more from the studio where I teach, Arizona, is walking up that same hallway where those two kids were laying and the one fell down the stairs. He sees me and comes up and says, “What do you think about the election?” I say, “Just like this sandbox here, we have the same people in the same demographics and no matter who is running, the outcome is going to be the same because the sand hasn’t changed from its compartments.” He says to me, “I think you’re wrong and I’ll tell you why.” By this time, he’s walked all the way up the hallway and is now standing beside me in the kitchen. I say, “Why? What do you think?” I’m really curious and given the political climate we live in, I’m obviously really hopeful because I would like for it to change. I don’t want the same person to be elected - he’s a Trump kind of person, but he’s not called Trump in the dream. So he starts talking to me and I can’t hear what he’s saying and I really want to hear him. He’s tilting his head to the side and I’m tilting my head to the side so I can still hear him and all of a sudden we’re lying down in a bed and I’m leaning in to hear what he’s saying the way you would lean into kiss someone, but the other person’s mouth is by your ear. Then I take my leg and wrap it over top him. His hands are around my low back and he flips me over, so I’m on my back but his hands are still behind me and he starts stroking underneath my buttocks and around my yoni from behind. It sends a rush of pleasure all the way up my spine and it was so pronounced that I woke up. I never got to hear what he thought about the election.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

224,1105,,13/02/2020,02/13/2020 00:01,"I’m in a train station and I’m looking at the boards that announce arrivals and departures and finding my train to get on. It’s an Amtrak train. I find the train I want. I get on through a gate that reminds of an airport, the way it’s set up to get on and off. I find my gate and I get on. I take a seat and the train starts to leave. It’s just me. I have a few bags with me. I’m watching as the train leaves the station. It never really goes outside. I think the train is in a tunnel the whole time, so it seems dark. There’s multiple stops and there’s some stops I need to get off of, but then I get back on the train. I get off and then I get back on. Now I’ve gotten off at this one particular spot and my kids are with me - I think I was picking them up. We don’t get back on the train at this same stop. We all get together and we go to a friend’s house and the friend's house is tiny. It’s in a more run down part of town. We’re there and her kids are there. The kids are all playing together and we’re talking. She’s telling me about how she’s ended a couple of habits she didn’t like. She stopped doing things the way she had been doing it and now she’s cleaning her house. Things look less cluttered in her space and she clearly felt better about all of it. Then I realize it’s time for us to go. It’s time for the kids to get back on the train. Before we go, another woman shows up. It’s a different friend who reminds me of my old hula teacher. She’s giving me some advice about how to parent because my daughter is definitely talking back and is resisting us getting on the train. I lose my temper in front of everyone and my daughter gets really pissed off and stomps off. Then both my friends are telling me how I could do it differently with her. I take their advice and I grab both my kids. We leave the house and head back to get on this train. It’s so important but I have no idea where we're going and I don’t know why. The sun has set now. It’s dark and we’re walking through a part of town that looks a little bit shady and it’s like a city and I have a death grip on both my kids’ hands because I don’t want anybody to snag them. Both my kids have their luggage, but I have this feeling that something is going to happen to the kids and I’m really worried. So we’re now rushing to get on this train. I’m looking at my phone - my phone is a map showing me where the terminals are for us to get on the train. But for some reason, the map in my hand is not syncing up with where we actually are. At one point, we walk into this nightclub and it’s full dark now. I don’t know how we walk into a nightclub with two udnerage kids, but we walk in there and we’re walking towards the back, looking for the train terminal for the entrance. I still can’t find it and I walk past the bartender and a bouncer and they both tell me that there’s no train in there. In the meantime, I have both my kids and it’s definitely not a place for minors. So I have this death grip on their hands and I’m pulling them back out of the nightclub, but somehow there’s a ring on my left finger that gets caught on the necklace of the bouncer who’s trying to help us out, telling us there isn’t a station there. It takes a minute for it to get untangled, although he does help me. Then I grab my kids hands again and we’re heading up the sidewalk trying to find another train station to get on these trains. My daughter doesn’t want to go and I’m having a hard time keeping her with me, but I’m so terrified that something’s going to happen to her because it’s dark out, it’s not a good part of the city, there’s people everywhere, she’s young - she’s only 12. My son is very happy to stay close by, but she wants to go off and explore and I’m not having it. She’s still pissed at me for whatever altercation we had at the friend’s house. So eventually I find a bike. We get on the bike - somehow I manage to get all three of us on with our luggage. I figure we’ll find the train wherever it is on its rails and get on that way. We’re on the bike. We’re riding through the streets and there’s snow up to my mid-calves and the snow is slushy. We’re still riding through it on the bike but of course it’s not safe. We’re riding with a lot of cars. I don’t feel safe with the cars because they could take us out any minute. We ride down this one hill into what seems to be much more like the ghettos. There’s tank drums and somebody’s got a fire in the drum. I’ve got the kids with me and I really don’t feel safe now. I see the train is actually in front of us at this intersection. There’s also a friend I know. He and his mom are in front of us and there’s also a train parked in front of us on some tracks through the intersection. I’m really wanting us to get on this train. We never make it on. I ask the friend and his mom for help, but they kind of ignore me and I’m stuck with my two kiddos, with no way to get on the train in this part of town that does not feel safe, on a bicycle in the snow.

227,1106,,14/02/2020,02/14/2020 00:02,"I’m with a group of people - I know some of them, they’re acquaintances that I’ve met here where I live, but we’re not close. We’ve met up and we’re going to a concert, but it’s music I don’t know or I don’t like. I’m not excited about it, but it’s strange. I can feel myself at this weird choice point, of whether or not I ought to go with them to see this music or even hang out with these people. I do choose to go with them, although I have no idea what my other choices would have been. I know that choosing to go with them is not really what I want to do. There’s a lot of resistance to it. But I go and we get to this amphitheatre - it’s in the middle of what looks like a huge mall. The music starts, we’re listening, and I’m not inspired by any of it. Although some of the musicians look familiar to me - I’ve met them before or they’re from some era of my past. We’re listening and while we’re listening there’s an instruction going on at a workshop of sorts and it’s how to sew. I am sewing which is cracking me up because I already know how, but the people around me don’t. So I’m just sewing away and now it’s like somebody else was messing with my thread and needle while I was sewing and now all the threads are super, super tangled. Everyone else is still managing to sew. I get the sense we had to sew these pieces to be able to continue watching. It was sort of like the admission fee. But now I can’t do it because my threads are so tangled with all these other spools of thread. I get up to break the threads, rip it out and start all over again. But even my act of trying to break the thread and start over again just makes things even more tangled. I’m really frustrated and annoyed because I know how to sew and I don’t tangle my threads and it’s like these threads are coming from nowhere completely ruining my ability to do a simple backstitch. Then the scene shifts a little and I’m in a bowling alley again - this is the second time I’ve been in a bowling alley. There’s a group of friends there - again these are acquaintances or people I know and have spent some time with, but not who I would choose to spend time with, especially since one is someone I had a falling out with. But I’m just watching them bowl and they’re all having a really good time. It’s fun to see them getting along and having a good time. They notice me. I’ve been on the outskirts this whole time. This bowling alley is in an outdoor space - the lanes have been laid down on some grass next to a river. It’s all outdoor, blue skies, so not in an actual alley. Anyway it’s time for me to bowl. It’s not time because I’m part of their team or anything; I’m just curious and I actually like to bowl because I’m so terrible at it. It’s one of my favorite things to do. So, I’m excited about getting to bowl. I step up to the lane but there’s somebody sitting really close to me - close to the lanes - his knee is propped up over his other leg so it’s sticking out to the side and in my way, so I can’t bowl. I come at my lane from an angle and of course I get a gutter ball because I can’t go head on or straight. So it’s somebody else’s turn and I go do something else for a little bit. Somebody is giving me a pep talk about me needing me to be directly behind the lane. I know this, but there’s a person sitting in the way. So it’s my turn again and I go to him and say, “Could you please move so I can bowl correctly?” The energy from this person is like they knew they needed to move the whole time but they were just having a good time seeing me try to maneuver around them. There's a lot of cockiness but he’s watching me to see if I’m going to get it. There’s also another layer of attraction coming from him. I’m just annoyed with all of it. All I can think of is what an egotistical shit. I want him to get out of the way. He does and now that it’s my turn and he’s not in my way, I go to bowl and it’s this absolutely perfect bowl, full strike, the ball goes speeding down the lane with the most perfect spin on it. It’s the most beautiful bowl you’ve ever seen. I turn around and look at everyone in the crowd, give them a smirk and leave. Then the dream ends.",Rose,last_nights_dream
228,1310,,14/02/2020,02/14/2020 00:03,"“The Partially Underwater City” This dream starts at what appears to be an after-concert party for the musicians. I’m in a long room and there are a few random tables set up with champagne and little bits of finger food. There’s small groups of people standing around and talking, mostly the artist’s family and friends. I see my first boyfriend and his parents, and I walk over and join their group. We’re chatting. The dream doesn’t expose the small talk we’re having. We break away from his parents - they’ve wandered off and I believe our conversation has finished. We say goodbye. There’s a partition at the back of this long room and we lie down together and cover up and embrace. I feel him. He’s getting hard and I want to bring him inside me. Then he buries his head in my chest and says something. I can’t hear what he’s saying but I just hug him. Then he says, “Let’s get up, I want to show you something.” So I do. We’re suddenly dressed. He takes my hand and we go outside and everywhere you can see is covered with water. He puts these shoes on and starts running across the water. I’m wondering how that is even possible, but I do the same thing and it is possible! I’m kind of scared as this is happening because what if I sink down into the ocean and I can’t swim. He’s running and he has purpose to his run, so I’m trying to keep up. He’s enough ahead of me that when he talks to a couple of people along the way I can’t hear what they’re saying. I start to notice that there’s buildings partially surfaced, so you can see the title of what the building is but the rest of it is underwater. I start to put together that this is an actual city. So as we go skating along the surface of the water, we stop at a particular place and he’s talking to three people and it’s technical stuff having to do with his music. So, I just wander around the corner. There’s no hidden anything because the tallest building is only about 2 feet above the surface of the water. So I’m looking around a little bit and I'm seeing other things, other than these banners of names to really large structures made of metal. They don’t have a name and they’re rusty. I start to feel really scared. They feel threatening because they’re so big. So I go back to where he is and I tell him I’m scared. So he stops talking to whoever he is, and he says, “Oh yes, here, I still want to show you something.” So again, he grabs my hand because he’s going faster than I am and I’m kind of trying to keep up. He’s used to this water skating, but I’m not quite. I’m still scared that the water’s going to engulf me. We skirt around and one of these big metal things is starting to come up out of the water and it’s turning. Part of it arcs up behind me and goes overtop and I’m trapped in this metal cube and it’s turning, but because it’s in the water it’s turning slow enough that I can run up to one side and stay submersed while the other side turns downwards. So I do this for a bit and I don’t see where he is. Maybe I climb up for three turns of this thing, then suddenly I see him and again he reaches out his hand, so I grab it and go out that way. Then we go into one of these things and it has the feel of something that’s not supposed to be there or a building of society where people who aren’t allowed in the other buildings congregate. It just has that dirty feel to it. Again he disappears for a frame in the dream. I’m in there and there’s this old guy and he’s got the weight of a painful existence all over his face and his teeth are dirty, his hair is dirty and he’s scowling. He looks like he hates everything because everything has hated him. I’m afraid of him, too. I look the opposite way that he is and there’s more people like him that way, so I’m frozen in the middle not knowing where to go in this building. The old hate guy stands up part way as though he’s going to walk over to me. I panic and I run out the opening - it’s not even a door, it’s just this metal thing with gaps. Whatever it is that it would be if it was all exposed and there was none of it under the water, so all the parts that make it up, I can’t tell what it is but there’s gaps in them. So I get out and I’m back on top of the water. I see my boyfriend again and we start skating over to another part of the city. Then it’s like Chinatown, so the spaces between the banners are closer together and it feels more like a city and there’s more people in it. Then I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream
229,1921,,14/02/2020,02/14/2020 00:04,I was back at my parents house standing in the driveway right in front of the shed. It was night time and the sky was clear and in the night sky you could see one or 2 half Crescent moons. It was very cold. As we waited there there were a few other people who joined us my dad was there my brother was there and maybe a few relatives such as Uncle P.. As we waited we watched as an extremely beautiful crystalline ice globe sort of condensed and formed out of midair right on the side of the shed but floating slightly away from it so that it was not actually touching the shed. As we stared at this bubble that formed it grew taller and smaller bubbles formed on top as I looked underneath it it was actually hollow from the inside in through it one could see the moons in the night sky.  It didn't last very long at it quickly faded away but it was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen in my life. I don't know exactly why would just the structure of the thing the fact that out of just nothing it could form itself as an organized structure and it was also very rare this was not something that happened often in the world and it had to be in a perfectly still setting in order to happen with the right temperature and humidity.  We waited for another object like this to form but because of the wind blowing and the movement of the air from our bodies it didn't happen until a little bit later when we were all standing perfectly still another structure formed not quite as large as the first one but just as beautiful.  The images in the string were extremely clear I could make it the details that were on this structure I could look through it I can look I could I could understand what it was in that dream all the mice my field of vision was not very large. upon waking though the dream slowly has become less and less clear though it is still clear than most dreams. I don't know why but for some reason this dream was extremely meaningful and I was just overwhelmed by the beauty within this dream and still to some extent overwhelmed by the beauty of what I saw in the dream even though inherently 8 wasn't that beautiful if it were to be reproduced now it may not have nearly as much beauty and mysticism as it had in the dream. But something of its structure of the way it came to be and how rare it was in just showed the beauty of creation and not only the beauty of creation but the beauty of what it is that our minds can come up with.,Bob,last_nights_dream2

234,1920,,16/02/2020,02/16/2020 00:02,"[graphic content]  The sequence of events with meeting the kids in this dream is very much out of order.  I was woken up (in the dream) to several neighbor kids rollerblading down my driveway and into my backyard. I thought it was interesting that they were able to do this in the grass with no apparent issue. I saw them as I looked out my window and noted that they shouldn't be rollerblading in other people's yard. However, they were kids, and I decided that it was fine if they wanted to play in my yard as this created a more friendly neighborhood.  Later, I went outside and ran into the older of the two boys. He was somewhere around 10 years old, and and had short to medium length blond hair. He was skittish and acted very cat-like in how he would let me approach him and then run away. I was walking to the right down the sidewalk and he was tagging along and talking to me. Doug was walking with me, as were Jared, and maybe another friend.   As we walked, the boy began to tell me about how much he hated his life at home and how evil his parents were. I think he specifically used the word ""evil"". He told me that his parents were involved in demonic rituals, potentially said that he was possessed, and used holy water to try to purify the children or themselves. I wasn't quite sure at the time if he was being serious or if he just was mad at his parents for some reason and making up stories. He went on ahead a little ways and I discussed the matter with Doug who also wasn't sure what was going on.  The next day, the older boy came over to our house and hung out with us for a bit. He really seemed to like it with us, but I was a bit worried. I asked him if his parents knew he was at our place, as I wanted to make sure that they were aware that he was hanging around with ""strangers"" and that it was okay with them. He hadn't told them, and I suggested that he let them know, or that we go and speak with them together so that it wouldn't be weird. He seemed hesitant to do this.  He was working on some kind of locking device which needed a stick to be inserted into a mechanism and screwed in place. He didn't have what he needed though for this, and I told him that after he got permission from his parents, we could head out into the woods behind my house, find a suitable tree or branch, and cut it down and use it for his project. I had a drill as well which I would use to help with the screws.  He left, that afternoon, and later his younger brother walked up to the door of the house by which I was sitting. He startled me when he opened the door and I yelled which then frightened him. He ran off, but then came back (the same skittish, cat-like quality as his brother). He was still a bit scared but I attempted to laugh at the situation and to calm him down.  It felt like the dream to this point took several days by the end of which we were friends with the two kids and very fond of them. Their parents still didn't know that they were hanging around our place. Later that evening, I was once again walking with the elder brother and asked him what his name was. It was ""Aaron"". I don't know the younger brother's name.  The next day, we decided to talk to the boys' mother and let her know that we were friends and that they were hanging out at our place. The entire time, there was this thought in the back of my mind that we needed to be sure that no one thought that we were pedophiles or anything of that nature.  Before we met with their mother, we walked down from my house and realized that these kids belonged to the neighbors down the hill from my parents' house who are very southern, have unruly dogs, and are generally not the greatest neighbors. We were pretty sure that bad things were going on in the house and that drugs were involved.  Their mother eventually approached me, and when I explained everything to her, she requested the most strange thing from me. She told me that the children's father had a problem--an infection--in his groin and that I had to come and take a look. He had been to the doctors, but they were unable to help. I told her that she needed to take him to the ER and that it didn't matter if they had insurance, they would be helped. She disagreed and said that they would eventually have to pay and that they couldn't afford it. She told me to come over and see what I could do. I tried to explain that I wasn't a doctor but she insisted.  I went back to my house and tried to figure out what to do. I had about 5 days worth of antibiotics (Bactrim) and was thinking that I'd just give that to him, but as he was already on an antibiotic and I wasn't sure how he'd react, I decided against it. I'm not sure why I agreed to help, but I did and went over very unwillingly.  The entire time, I was fairly certain of what was going on. This old man was fine, and simply wanted me to examine him as he would get some sort of sick pleasure out of this. I had no proof, but this was my suspicion.  I went over to his house, and my suspicions were grotesquely confirmed.   He was lying on his back on his bed, naked, very much erect, and masturbating. He clearly wanted both me and his oldest son to be there and watch him. He was writhing on the bed with demonic glee that he had succeeded in forcing me to witness this. His feet were moving in quick, spasmodic jerks as if trying to reach for something... When he finished, the bed was covered in white, almost silvery, semen and at this point I tried my best to get the oldest son out of the doorway of the room.  Throughout the entire dream, I sort of wanted to adopt the kids as they needed a better home and we liked one another. My thought was that I would get married and then let the kids live with me. Upon waking, this thought persists.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

The city looked like I was walking around in Roman times - it was the architecture. Things were made of stone, there were carvings everywhere. It was very lush, actually, with Mediterranean type plants (not Amazon). As I walked through the city, I was kind of leaving the cosmopolitan area of it and walking to a place that was quiet. In this place, too, I felt like a lot of time had lapsed since I had been there the time before. Things were not the way they were the last time I had seen them. There were stones in the garden that instead of being upright, they were lying down and I couldn’t see what had been carved on them. I knew that something was carved on them and they’d all been turned down so that you couldn’t see what was on them. So I was making my way past them. No one else was there, just me. The plants had grown around them so they’d been turned down for some time. Eventually I came to a well. This well had stonework built up around it so there was about a 4 foot ledge around the well. I was leaning on it with my forearms and gazing downwards into its darkness. I could hear the sounds of water. I could smell it, too. I just stood there for a little bit with the well. Then I left an offering. I had something in my hand. I left it there. Then I got up and continued to make my way through the garden. But something caused me to turn back. I did and one of the stones shifted - it was a large one. All these stones I’m describing are at least as tall as a person. When I turned back and looked, I walk toward this stone that was now upright. It’s Minerva. I sat there beside her for a little bit and wondered what cataclysmic event has caused all the gods and goddesses to be turned away. As I was mulling that through my mind, I was also happy that something had happened that was allowing them to turn back up - to return.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

We entered the room and took them all prisoner and were waiting for backup so that they could be dealt with.  At that point, I realized that I only had a little bit of time and decided that I would have sex with the Queen of Death. I knew she was a magical creature, however, so I looked up her stats in my copy of The Player's Handbook to see if there would be any unforseen consequences to this action.

We entered a room with white floors and chairs spread throughout which was difficult to navigate through with a wheelchair. We got to the other side and realized that we were a bit lost. We went back and found an elevator, but we weren't sure if it would work. The elevator didn't have any walls, but was a metalic gridded platform at the top of a set of stairs. It was hardly  large enough for both of us, and my assumption was that once you got onto it, the walls would come down and then it would move.  We did get onto the platform, but when I looked at the buttons, I didn't know which one to press. There were so many different buttons on the black panel, and I couldn't figure out what any of them meant. We got off of the elevator and went up to some offices where nurses in white gowns were bustling to and fro. I think I manage to catch one of them as she was leaving the busier area and she told me that I wanted to go up stairs and enter through an archway numbered 108. I went that way and two doctors met me before we got there. We were then both lying on the ground and one of the doctors was scanning William, saying, ""We have to make sure that there aren't any tubules such as pencils which you might have swallowed and would have come back up into your throat to cause stomach pain."" The other doctor came over to me and was also testing something though I do not know what.  We got up and were still in the hospital, but the dream had changed. I was now with (or was) Elliot McGabbhan and was trying to find help for some issues he was having. He ended up running into his therapist, Dr. Oliver Sacks, who was willing to speak with him briefly though he had another client in 40 minutes. I watched Elliot as he told Dr. Sacks that he needed money to support his mother and sister and that he was only able to bring home 2 to 3 thousand a month and that their family would go through that in 2 weeks. He spoke further, but eventually Dr. Sacks stopped listening. His time was up, and Dr. Sacks had to prepare himself for the next patient. He wasn't rude, but he effectively said that he couldn't help any further and that Elliot had to leave. Then Dr. Sacks lay down on the floor, closed his eyes, and began to meditate. Elliot said, ""You're mean."" but he didn't respond. As Elliot left, I saw that Dr. Sacks was now suspended in mid-air, about 3 feet off of the ground and was surrounded by blue and golden light with what looked like lightning crackling. It was a very beautiful and psychedelic scene. The room was small, dark and dome-like and there had always been golden light.

There’s also a vase of flowers in the room - I don’t know if somebody gave them to me, or if they’re just there. I put them next to the bed on this tall nightstand.

So I follow him to a table, but there’s enough distance between us that by the time I finally get to the table, he’s already ordered drinks and he has hor d'oeuvres coming and he’s on his second drink already. I go to sit down at the table, still very reluctant. There are other people who will join us. He has me try one of his drinks. It’s alcoholic and super sugary sweet gross, and I don’t want to taste it because I know alcohol is so bad for me - it will make me feel really badly really quickly and I hate that I’m here with him. It feels like I’m being made to perform the dutiful hostess while he performs the gross role of extravagant host. He’s ordering all the food and our guests are here now. It’s two different couples, both man and wife, female and male couples. They’ve sat down and my ex is getting loud and really arrogant and ordering the food for everyone. He’s ordering tapas for everyone but it has dairy or grain, which is all food I’m allergic to, so there's nothing for me to eat or drink. I’m trying to make small talk with these friends of his. The men are also gross and arrogant and the wives are too, but the one next to me is a little more subdued in her behavior and demeanor. She’s not loud and laughing. She’s more quiet and we are sitting next to each other. I feel a little connection with her, although at one point someone spills a cocktail all over both of us and it’s sticky and she’s laughing but I’m annoyed. Then somehow the dinner is over and the scene changes because now I'm off by myself. I’m really grateful to be by myself. I’m walking up through these hills and I can still see the restaurant I had been in, which is on a pier. I have an impression of the ocean that was part of the background of this restaurant. But now I’m walking through these smaller rolling hills - they’re all green. There are copses of trees and when I look up the hill, it’s thickly covered in forest, but I’m not in that thicker part yet. There’s a fire somewhere and now I’m following these men who are firefighters - they’re very burly, muscular and thick - cliche of a firefighter. I’m on stealth mode for some reason. I know I have to get to this fire to see what’s going on, but I don’t want to get in the way of the firefighters. So I'm following them, but being very sneaky and hiding behind some of the trees as I follow them to this road. I can hear dispatch giving them instructions to the road of how to get to the fire. I’m following along but sneaking behind everyone, though I can see everything playing out in front of me. Then I get to this place where I’m looking at the road and I can see the fire engines. It’s a dirt road, but there are houses along it. They are driving through neighborhoods, but where I’m standing, there’s a souvenir store like what you'd see at Disneyland to pick up Disneyland stuff. I’m not entirely sure what the souvenirs are, but it has that feel of a place where tourists come to spend money. I’m in this store but still watching what’s happening outside as the firefighters are heading towards this fire. All of a sudden, there is an assassination and I’m watching the person who is supposed to be doing the assassinating. I’m not entirely sure who he’s supposed to kill, but this person is an elf and has a silver bow that he’s going to do the assasination with. I’m watching him weave through the crowd and hide behind some of the displays in the shop. He finally gets his eyes on the person he’s going to assassinate. He puts his silver bow down next to him and it starts sliding away. All of a sudden the aisles in this store mimic the hills I’ve been walking on. This bow starts to slide away from him and somebody notices it and says, “I don’t know how you’re going to kill your target if your bow is sliding away.” He looks up and realizes that somebody else has been tracking him as he’s been tracking his target, and I’ve been watching all of this go on. All of a sudden, there’s a commotion outside the store. The woman who had been sitting next to me at dinner is being attacked by someone - whether it is the assassin's target or not, I’m not sure, but I see her pulled behind the side of the building and then there’s screaming. I’m really worried at this point because it doesn’t seem like anyone is going to stop them, except maybe this assassin in front of me with his bow sliding away down the hill. Then the dream ends.",Rose,last_nights_dream

My husband, another man, and I unsettle a man that’s been sleeping. We nudge at his shoulders and try to wake him up, interfering with his sleep. He starts to grumble. Then we realize that it’s a really dangerous thing we’ve done - waking him up. He’s now after us with a gun. I run downstairs and move a bench out of the way next to a bed and shimmy under the bed. I’m hiding there and I can see under the bed that it’s dusty with moth balls. I also see one of my son’s winter hats and one of my malas. Then I realize that I’ve forgotten the light and it’s still on. So I start to scooch out to turn off the light. As I do this, my husband comes into the room and says the guy has gone back to sleep, but he’s not fully asleep. He’s levitating with his arms reaching up to the sky, in an interesting dream state, so we’re okay. He’s not going to come after us with his gun.

I know what that feels like. I would never do that to another woman.” I was looking her in the eyes. She could tell I was legit and there was a lot of compassion that was shared between us. I was like, “I would never do that to someone. No one deserves to feel like that and I would never participate in something like that.” She felt good.

248,1312,,19/02/2020,02/19/2020 00:04,"“The Betrayal” This dream begins in a laboratory school. There’s windows along one side and then at 90 degree angles from the wall of windows, there’s a series of four rooms sided by a brick wall on the other side. The wall of windows ends with a door that goes out into another hallway. So you can actually go out one door, down the hallway, back in a different door and back through all the rooms that are sided by the windows. In one of these rooms, I find Omar. He’s in bed with my sister. I think what an odd place for a bedroom. I wonder what they’re doing even though in the back of my mind I’m also thinking, “Oh my god, they’re in bed together.” In real life, they didn’t even know each other. It’s not like this is possible. So I walk over slowly and I thought maybe I should ask questions before jumping to conclusions. So when I approach them, Omar is talking about something very philosophical and I look at him strangely and he says, “What?” I say, “Well, you don’t usually get like that unless you’ve just had sex.” He looks at me as if he was betrayed. Then I add, “Or just finished some kind of meditation or something else relaxing.” Then I also notice other things about their body language. His leg is draped over hers. She hasn’t said anything yet. The bed clothes are also twisted and wrapped around them. So at this point he gets up and he’s upset and he’s kind of swallowed by a group of other people. I want to talk to him more, but each time he goes to another group of people, I get swallowed by them and another activity occurs. The first one I’m taken out of this building and into an outdoor area that has a campfire and people standing around talking in small groups. I look for him there but he’s not there. Then I go back through that realm into the observation area. I get a quick glimpse of him as he walks from that doorway into another one.I follow and I’m taken again into a different realm where people are in conversation, so I’m just floating around them. This time I come back and I quickly look through the other two rooms - go out the one door and in the hallway there’s these low tables with children at them. There Are two different ones with about six children and one adult at them and they’re eating a snack. One of the teachers says to me, “What do I have to do to get someone to fill our drinks around here?” I think, “What the heck? That’s not what I’m here for. I’m doing something else.” I ignore her and continue to walk down the hallways. I just see his back for a split second and then there's too many people between me and where he is, so I give up. I just stand in the hallway for a second and think this is my own fault because of my questions and my lack of trust. That’s what sent him away. But I’m confused because I also feel like neither one of them should have been in that situation where my trust was compromised.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream
249,1313,,19/02/2020,02/19/2020 00:05,"“The Recital” This is a really long dream, so I’m going to summarize some of the parts. It opens up and I’m at a wedding dance - a wedding celebration where people are dancing. There’s log tables with people sitting at them and food. The point of this part of it is I’m surrounded by people I do not want to be surrounded by. I love dancing but i can’t find anybody I want to dance with. And the people at this wedding are people I don’t want to share a meal with, so it’s not very much fun. The scene immediately shifts and I’m in a farmhouse in a completely different era. I'm participating in making and preserving food. So various people are doing various things. There’s some people who are actually churning butter. There are people that are milking cows and bringing the milk in pails to the people that are churning the butter. I am aware that there’s a smokehouse and there’s people building the fires and curing and smoking meats. It's outside though. Both of these are outside - the smokehouse is further away. Of course the cows are further away than that. The churning butter is closer to the house and I’m actually in the farmhouse. I’m in the kitchen. I’ve been chopping and making what appears to be kimchi which is odd given the historical setting. I’m putting it all in mason jars and sealing them. I can still smell the aroma of boiling vinegar in my nose. When I finish this, I turn around and Omar is there again. He’s distanced from me again, so he doesn’t really know me. It’s like it’s Omar’s body but not his spirit in it. He sort of doesn’t know who I am. He tells me that he’s been aging Scotch. He tells me what he did with it. I ask him, “Well, did it work?” He says, “No.” Then the time speeds up and all of a sudden it’s today’s time and I have the two kids that I have. I’m telling Omar that I have to leave to take my son to his dance lesson. I ask him if he wants to come. He says, no he can’t. So I’m disappointed, but I have to go. I leave to go out the farmhouse door. This other guy that used to be a neighborhood thief hops in the car - in the backseat - as I’m leaving. I end up driving him to Brantford where he gets out and takes off somewhere. So I’ve picked up both my kids. I’m taking them to the dance lesson. There’s been some fiddling around and delays. When I was trying to get in the car, I was trying to get this thief out of it, and I think I’ve barely made it in time. I think the lesson is an hour, but as it turns out, it’s only a half hour and as soon as we get there, it’s over. So I take my kids back into the car and my son’s dad is in the backseat. He gets out and checks the oil level in the trunk and he’s spilling it everywhere. I’m like, “Oh I didn’t even want you to do that because I’m in a hurry again. Now why is he here delaying me?” Then he disappears and I’m immediately back in the parking lot of hte dance lesson building again. Time just skipped to another day. So I’m taking my kids back in and we're on time this time. I walk them into the recital hall. My son is acting in it and my daughter is dancing. I’m sitting up really close to him and I realize that he’s got different makeup on and he’s got an elaborate costume. He’s acting like an old man. He’s supposed to be chauffeuring another person from the play. I’m astonished at what a good job he’s doing with the acting right down to the smallest movements of his body. The rehearsal is finished and both my kids are given parts, none of which they’ve auditioned for, but they’re lead roles and neither one of my kids are lead-role people. They accept them graciously. They’re supposed to walk up onto the stage - each kid has done this - stand there to wait to be bestowed some kind of role and then curtsy and bow and exit out the other side of the stage and come back to their seats. So they’ve done this. When they get to their seats, they say, “Oh no, Mom, I didn’t want these and I don’t want to be the lead role” and blah blah blah. Then I tell them, “Well, you should say something.” They’re like, “Nobody ever complains. They just take the roles. We don’t want to be the first ones to complain.” And I say, “Well, if you don't want to do it, speak up. Maybe you could just ask if you can speak to them separately.” So my daughter approaches the head dance role person and I can’t hear what they’re saying, but they’re speaking. A moment later this head person says that my kids have something to say. They’ve set up this thing - like a platform. They wheel it onto the stage. It's long and skinny, about 4 feet long and about a foot wide. It’s on wheels and it’s got a railing around it, only on three sides, though. So they enter it from the back where there’s no railing. They have to stand in this and the dance role person makes them announce what they have asked to say. So it almost feels like a humiliation, but I don’t know if it’s a humiliation or an honoring as they’ve put them in this railing thing and wheeled them onto the stage. They say, ”Um, we don’t want these roles. Thank you very much, but we graciously decline these roles.” Then the audience starts clapping. They don’t look upset, so I’m thinking, “Phew, oh look at them. I’m glad that they have been true to themselves.”",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

She’s like a Barbie doll - really skinny with bleach blonde hair. She’s wearing a pink gown, her hair is done just right, her makeup is done just right. She’s this archetype of a “perfect” woman advertised in magazines. He’s being a gentleman - pulling her chair out, pouring wine into her glass, and being really attentive to all her needs. She’s responding to him. I’m aware that she’s intentionally being mean to me in showing her feelings towards my husband. I get livid. This is not unusual in my dreams. I’m punching and kicking and making a huge display. Then I have to retire to another room and rest for the night. Everybody has to lie down on floors and go to sleep. Then the next part of the dream, there’s an assembly of people sitting in chairs like in a college auditorium. There’s been a rebellion. Every year we base our family celebration (something like Thanksgiving) on multidimensional geometry. But this year, there’s a rebellion. This big guy who looks like he used to play football but is now heavy from beer and nachos stands up and draws a single dimension triangle with squiggles around it. He says we’re doing it this way this year. So he makes it really flat and simple. There are grumbles throughout - some people are really upset but can’t do anything about it, others are more supportive and happy it will be easier for them to understand. I am forced to join this new celebration. Everyone around me is heavy - they drink a lot of beer and eat a lot of processed food - they’re like your typical American. They’re making the feast. I am participating in making the feast. They give me a sip of this walnut liquor and I find it unusual that they have a taste for this liquor because it seems quite refined. Then somebody is talking about the walnut flooring they were able to purchase for their new home because somebody else maybe their girlfriend lent them $500 to help with their school, so they had this extra money to put towards the new floors in their home. Then I look out the window and there’s a spaceship flying by, so we must be really high in the sky. I look in the window of this new spaceship and it has a table with seating for four and a little loveseat.

The section of this dream that stood out the most was towards the end when I was in a dorm room. I was so exhausted from everything I’d been doing and I just wanted to lay down and sleep until the graduation ceremony I was to go to. I laid down on what looked like a chaise lounge in a bedroom in a dorm room. There was another bed across from me. The entrance to the bathroom was in between the two beds. Although I was exhausted, I was aware, not awake, but aware, that a young man had come into the room and was also getting ready for the graduation. I’m also young - we’re both college aged. He’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen, like from a different realm beautiful. That was the consensus all around, it wasn’t just my thoughts, the other women who were around thought the same. He’s being very considerate of the fact that I'm so tired and has not woken me at all, although I am still aware that he’s there, I’m still sleeping because I can feel the exhaustion dragging at my bones. There’s some sort of conversation he’s having with some other young women in the room about the plants, the flowers, that he has gathered for lies. He has a very magical quality about him - he seems very wise and ancient, like he knows a lot. So he’s explaining a little bit about why he’s picked plants for the leis for this graduation. He actually comes in and sits near me on my little bed, chaise-lounge, and is explaining one of the plants to some of the other women in the room, but I wake up at this point and as he’s explaining it, I’m looking at the plant. In the meantime, this beautiful young man creature is trying to get me to hurry because it’s time to get to this graduation. We haven’t been, but I’m just so mesmerized by all the different leis and necklaces in this box - there’s kukui nut leis and necklaces made of seed beds with over a hundred strands and they’re twisted together in pink and white and they’re heavy and gorgeous. But I know how much work has gone into making all these necklaces. There’s necklaces that have other polished crystal stones that look like pieces of peridot and darker stones, so maybe obsidian and onyx and those are single strands, but the stones are rather large. I start hanging them up in front of me. Suddenly these hooks appear and the hooks begin to fill with all of these necklaces and I’m running out of room for the hooks for the necklaces to hang. Also in the box is this huge ball of twine, but it reminds me of silk that you use to make necklaces with and it’s dyed a dark purple and there’s also beads that are not actually seeds from a plant about the size of those cilantro seeds. They’re dark brown and dried out with holes drilled through them. There’s a little package of them and it looks like 50 or so of them. I realize that I want to strand my own necklace with some of these seeds and make my own for part of the graduation although I have no time and I don’t know why I’d want to do that. I start to bead some of these seeds on the silk twine. I can hear myself say I can put them all on and the young man who is standing there gets a little upset with me and he says, “No, those are too powerful. You only need 6.” I look at him and he’s upset. He’s very adamant that I only need 6 on this necklace I’m making. So I stop. I have probably 10 or 12 on by now, but I stop making the necklace and I put it down. I realize I’m not going to have time to finish that necklace and I just need to pick one from all the ones I have and get to this graduation.

258,1314,,21/02/2020,02/21/2020 00:04,"“I’m a Ghost” In this dream, I live in and on top of a giant stream. Imagine you’re tiny and the stream is like a mountain stream. So there’s vegetation and trees around it, and it runs downhill over rocks and stuff, so it’s not really deep, it’s just flowing. People are living on top of it as though there’s platforms built up at the edges of the stream and they hold 50-100 people, each one of these and there’s buildings on top of them. So the stream is magnified tens of thousands of times of what a stream would be - it’s more like a river, but it’s not deep, it’s like a mountain stream. I live on one of these platforms. My kids are there, too. We’re busy collecting food and doing things to prepare it. It’s very rustic. There’s no technology or anything like that. One day, I need to climb up the stream. So I'm doing this. My feet are touching the bottom of it. It’s hard work because this stream is fast flowing. At one point, I can’t move anymore. I’m struggling and still trying to move. Then there’s a blank in the dream and I’m simply aware that I’m lying in the stream face up and it’s flowing over me and I can’t move any of my limbs or my body and my head. I’ve been cut open. There’s various parts of me that have actually been harvested. I don’t feel any pain. Then I leave my body and I circulate around the community. I come back to my body at certain times and every time I come back to my body I’m starting to forget that it’s mine. One day when I leave it, I go with my kids down to the ocean. You get there by exiting the stream through one of these platforms, walking through the forested area down to the beach and then to the ocean. They’re digging a hole - the way you would dig for a sand castle - and then just sitting on the sides of it. They’ve made a tunnel through one side of it that goes through the hole they’ve made, down to the water. Every time a wave comes up it goes through this little tunnel, fills the hole and then washes back out again. They’re just sitting there and I sit with them with my feet in the hole. Then the dream shifts through time periods and I’m in the house that Omar and I owned on A. Street. I see him and my heart warms. He’s coming in and out of the house, moving stuff. He’s bringing things in, setting them down, going back out, carrying another box and whatnot. There’s construction going on in the house, as well. I’m sitting at the kitchen table. I feel like he sees me. He looks and I move up. I don’t want to stand right in front of his face just in case that’s startling. He does see me. I stand really close to him and I lean against the wall. He pauses and stops there. At one point our eyes meet, we make eye contact, though I’m not sure he can see mine. He smiles and then it’s as if he doubts it. Then he goes, turns around, goes back out and gets another load of whatever it is he’s moving in and out of the house. I just walk through the house, observing the construction that’s going on. I walk up the stairs to the top floor, back down the stairs to the living room and kitchen again, and then out the front door. I walk up A. Street and then I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

No one believed me. I went out one day to confirm my suspicions. I saw the reflection in the window of someone behind me and I turned and no one was there. A tall cowboy western looking guy in a blue flannel. I looked in the window and saw him again and when I turned around he was there with his wife and daughter and they walked away together really floaty and turned around to look at me once. They were ghosts. I was nervous but I went into the house and I saw someone sleeping. I got scared and ran all the way home and he was running behind me. I got inside and closed the door and he stood there begging to talk. So I talked to him and he was actually really nice and asked if he could help fix it up in exchange for living there for a year. I thought that seemed fair. He had a job and was saving all his money to marry his girlfriend. I agreed but didn’t tell anyone that lived with me about the arrangements.

And there was an eerie feeling about it. My niece was playing on it. I called her over to swim with the kitties and to look at the pony. I don’t think she listened.",Tita,last_nights_dream

262,1109,,22/02/2020,02/22/2020 00:03,"I find myself at the house of a friend. I’ve never been to this house before and it’s in a neighborhood of Modern McMansion houses - they are square and blocky with large windows. I’m heading up into this friend’s house and we are going through the home and into her backyard which looks like an obstacle course. There’s people training and it looks like she has been working out or coaching. Her husband is there with their baby. I know both of them, but what’s fascinating is I go up to her and she’s always been shorter than me, but in this dream maybe she’s standing on a stair or something. So when I go to hug her, I can tuck my head under her chin and my face is pressed against the top of her chest and I can feel her heartbeat. There’s something in this hug that’s a little bit more than friendly because there’s literal heat between the two of us that I can feel on my face and I can feel it radiating off her chest right above her heart. The history between this friend and I was not healthy in any way, but this seems like a forgive and forget situation with this hug and we are both very happy to see each other. She’s almost like a little kid. She really wants to show me all the things in her home and obstacle course/training area. I can tell she’s been training because my arm brushes against her arm and the muscles in her arm are so hard, they feel like a rock. I can tell she’s so happy to see me. She’s not reaching out to touch me or hold me on purpose, but I can feel that she wants to, which is fascinating because her husband is standing behind her with their baby. We decide to go somewhere. She wants to show me some other things. I’ve already said hello to the husband and the baby is so cute and adorable. So we all head out to the garage to get into her car. Her car is a Jeep which she used to have and sold in real life. This Jeep is even bigger and the husband and baby get in the back and I sit up in the front seat with her. She goes to pull out of the driveway, but she pulls this maneuver where she pulls the Jeep all the way around so I can see the obstacle course in her backyard and there’s a metal railing that’s on the edge of this building that the Jeep has climbed on top of. She pulls all the way forward so the metal railing is the only thing holding the Jeep up - more than half of the Jeep is in the air. I’m a little terrified and looking at her like, what are you doing, we’re all going to die because now you’re driving this Jeep off the end of your building. But the metal railing holds and slingshots the Jeep back and she reverses down off the building, down some stairs and into the driveway, then pulls into the street and off we go. I’m horrified that we almost died, but she’s laughing because it was just a funny joke. Then I have a scene change and it’s nighttime. I’m walking into another house. There’s lights on and a party going on. I know some of the people in the party, but I don’t know all of them. I am like, what am I doing here? I don’t like parties, I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I don’t do any of the things people do at parties. I don’t know why I’m there. The overall feeling is one of major resistance and I have bile rising in my throat and disgust. I’m watching what others are doing and keep thinking, “This is not me. I don’t do parties like this.” It reminds me of high school or college, and who knew what was going on in all of those things. I just felt gross and wanted out. The scene changed again. Now I’m in a grocery coop and being trained to work there. But it’s also like a retreat center and there’s grounds with wild animals, or maybe they aren’t wild. At some point I see somebody saying goodbye to 4 lions and the lions walk up to them and snuggle with them like you would hug your dog goodbye. That’s happening on these grounds with green grass and trees and flowers. There’s other animals - I can’t tell what they are, but I can tell they’re there, I can feel their presence. At one point it seems like a retreat center because all of these people are gathered and it’s women - mothers and children mostly - and some men. We are on a deck that looks like a ship because there’s a beach nearby - I can hear and smell the salt water and moisture in the air. We’re all gathered because there’s a huge pile of lost and found clothes and we’re trying to give them away. It’s the people that have come to the party. So they’re trying to identify who owns what clothes. There’s bathing suits and little kid clothing and all kinds of stuff. I’m running around looking at these clothes and wanting to hand them back to the mothers. But there’s somebody auctioning them off. It’s strange because while they’re auctioning these off, there’s an underlying layer of guilt and shame for losing their clothes in the first place and for the size of the clothing - they aren’t all tiny extra small bathing suits or leggings. I’m pissed off and go gather up all the clothes because I know whose clothes belong to who. I walk around returning the clothes without the spectacle because it’s so shaming and degrading to the mothers who just misplaced an article of clothing. That completes and I go back into the building part of this retreat center/coop grocery store. I’m learning how to stock shelves and the clean up duties - what is necessary before the retreat can close for the night or season. It feels like closing for the season. Some people are painting and I’m noticing they’re doing a horrible job. They keep missing places or getting black paint on places they shouldn’t. There’s watering of plants and trimming of dead parts of the plants. People keep leaving the plant pots places, so I’m gathering these extra pots and I don’t know where the plants themselves have gone, but I know we want to save these plant plots for new shoots. So I’m gathering them up. There seems to be an awful lot of steps to close up this place, but it’s time to go and it’s mostly clean. The water fountains are cleaned. The wood has been polished. The not quite right paint is mostly dry and just a few parts are missing black paint and some parts have paint passed where it’s supposed to be. But for the most part, it’s tidy, everything has been picked up, there’s no clothing left anywhere. This is when I turn and see the person turn around and say goodbye to the lions. There are four lions, all males. I’m watching them hug these lions goodbye and wondering when they’re going to be eaten, but they don’t. Then the dream ends.",Rose,last_nights_dream

I liked working at the restaurant - it had good management and the team I worked with were excellent, but in the dream it is different. My section has about fourteen tables in it. The hostess continually seats people one after another in my section. As soon as I take a drink order from one table, she seats someone else. When I go to fulfill the drink order, there’s four more, and my section keeps expanding. So instead of ending at eight tables, there’s four more that I didn’t know about. I try to talk to her about this and tell her other servers need tables in theirs and ask her why she keeps seating me. The hostess stand is now miles and miles away from my section which is now miles and miles wide. People are angry with me. They’re like, “Where’s my drink? We’ve been sitting here too long.” I go back to get napkins and somebody’s spilled grape juice and it’s permeated every single white napkin. Everywhere I go to get more napkins there’s either coffee on it or something else. There’s no cutlery and it just goes on and on like that.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

267,1110,,23/02/2020,02/23/2020 00:02,"I only remember a snippet of this dream. I am walking through streets in a neighborhood and the houses are quite sweet. It’s a very clean neighborhood. The lawns are well tended. Even though some of the houses are older, they are quite well tended. They vary in size - shorter ranch style 2 and 3 bedrooms to taller, 2-story houses. As I’m walking through the neighborhood. I see what looks like an ilima tree - a small flower native to Hawaii, orange with a red center. But then it morphs and sometimes it looks like a hibiscus and sometimes it looks like a plumeria. This is all 1 tree that changes every time I try to get a closer look. I pluck one flower and put it behind my ear. I’m in a robe or maybe a lavalava (sarong) wrapped around me. It’s warm so I don’t need a lot of clothes. I continue walking down this street. I’m headed back towards whatever home I came from. There was some sort of celebration happening and I think I’ve left friends and family there. I just needed to go out for a walk and I’m headed back in their direction. As I’m walking down the street, I’m walking past this tall house with a wrought-iron fence and stone pillars. There’s vines growing up it and an entrance with stone steps up to a gate that would let you in. I can see there’s a pond in part of the front yard. I can see there’s very tall windows - they’re tall and arched square window panes except for the top half where the arch happens with quarters of a circle and it’s grey stone. You can see into the house. I see all of this and immediately think how exhausted I am. I fall asleep right there on the sidewalk. Whatever I’m wearing turns into a fuzzy blanket and I wrap it around myself. I curl up right there on the sidewalk and fall asleep. I keep thinking how exhausted I am. Yet while I’m asleep, part of me is still awake and listening. I can hear from the other side of the stone wall the voice of a woman who used to be my teacher. She’s talking to her daughter. She’s telling her daughter about the fish pond in front and how there’s more koi fish in it now than the last time they were there and that’s a good thing that the fish have grown and reproduced in this pond. I hear her daughter ask her some questions and she continues to teach a little bit. I can hear this entire conversation very clearly while I’m still asleep on the sidewalk outside this house. Then it dawns on me that this place I’m asleep outside of is a retreat place that sisters of mine used to go to to get lessons from this woman. There’s an awkwardness now because I don’t want her to find me asleep outside of this place. She’s there with her daughter and doesn't have any students and it does not feel like the presence of me or any of her old students would be welcome. So I wake myself up and continue to walk down. Now I’ve come out from the stone wall portion of this fence and I’m hoping she doesn’t see me as I walk through this wrought-iron part with railings you can see through even though there are vines and flowers climbing all over it. I walk relatively quickly past and am somewhat disturbed too because I realize my blanket-robe thing I’m wearing doesn’t have any pockets and I also suddenly can’t find my phone. I need my phone to find my way back and speak with friends and family. I’m rushing past this house and towards the house I left - the party I had left. But without my phone, I’m so distraught and I wonder if it’s back where I had been in front of that house. But I don’t want to go back and look because I don't want my old teacher to see me.",Rose,last_nights_dream
268,1912,,23/02/2020,02/23/2020 00:03,"I was having a fairly normal dream in what seemed to be a very realistic and vivid dream world. It was day time and Summer and I could hear birds singing. I was walking across a lawn near the house of someone I knew who had several daughters playing outside on two tree swings. I came in front of the swings and had to duck down to avoid being hit by the besandaled feet of the two girls. I may have not ducked down low enough and their shoes scraped my side.   As I kept going, a man showed up who called himself ""The Dream Master"" and revealed to me by some means that my entire reality had been a lie and that the world I knew was under his control. He had long, blond hair and reminded me a bit of some TV character that I have seen. He proceeded to destroy my world and then reset me to another point on my timeline such that I had no recollection that he had been there.  I was going about my day to day life with no suspicion that anything was wrong, when as I walked down the road, I found myself in a car with the Dream Master who turned and smiled at me and as I realized that once again my reality wasn't what I had thought it was. He drove me to a building where he let me out. To my left was a shiny metallic building and as I watched, he began to destroy it. It disintegrated and I ran in the opposite direction. I entered the building to my right which was an extremely large multi-story complex. As soon as I was inside, it too began to crumble. I ran further and further into it, with the floors falling to pieces behind me. I was trying to go far enough into it or up in it that I would be safe.  The dream transitioned into my staring at the Dream Master. I tried to attack him and managed to bite of several long shreds of flesh on his arm but they turned to some kind of chicken or beef in my mouth as I hadn't really hurt him and he was still in control and only messing with me. It was then that I realized that while my previous reality may have been fake, what was happening now was still real. I decided that I must accept this world in which I was being manipulated and which was controlled by the Dream Master and make the best of it.  I found myself at my house with family and friends around me. The Dream Master was also there and we were fighting him. There was something with a toy vehicle which belonged to a child or a child-version of the Dream Master which we set out in the road such that it got hit by a semi-truck. Together we fought the Dream Master and were partially victorious. The cops came to take him away, and he turned into a teenage version of himself who while still in control had lost much of his power.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

He reminds me of the first man I fell in love with nearly 20 years ago. I’m semi-lucid and keep rearranging the scenes, repeating moments to get them just right and perfect so I can be with him. In one of the scenes, we are in a big room with many beds of all different sizes. He has one bed and the other beds are for others. I somehow make all the beds shift over to one side of the room. My intention is to have our bed separate from the others. Then I look over and see him sitting next to me on a bench. We’re on the same side of the room with the cluster of beds all pushed up next to each other. The other side of the room is empty and it feels unbalanced. So I erase the scene and start all over again. There are other scenes I can’t recall. Now we are in a grassy field like a baseball field - this is the last one.

271,1111,,24/02/2020,02/24/2020 00:02,"I’m in a room gathering supplies. It’s clothing and shoes which all look the same and are necessary for a dance routine that will be performed. I’m wearing black low heeled booties and leggings and a tight top with a cowl neck. My clothing seems important because it’s part of the show I’m going to put on, or I need to wear as the teacher who is going to be teaching others the dance moves of this show we are going to put on. Then I go out from this room - I guess it’s like a costume closet - and I’m carrying all the pieces of clothing that others need. I’m walking down a hall and I walk into my old cafeteria from grade school. Everyone is there to learn this dance. I set all the clothes out and the people who need them grab what they need. I stand back and watch as an older Latina woman with dark hair tied up in a bun shows everyone the dance moves they need to know. They’re kind of jerky, like robot type, but she teaches them all. Everybody starts doing this dance synchronized together. I’m watching. I’m not part of this thing. The whole dance seems a little bit off. I look back to the pile of clothes and it’s changed into different items than I gave out. It’s a bunch of grey athletic pants and there are what I first think to be sports bras, but are women’s underwear - super strappy like 10 straps on each side where the hips would be. They remind me a lot of pole dancing shorts. The pile is a mess now - instead of being piled neatly, it’s all over the place. I look back and everybody is in fact wearing a black top and these grey athletic pants. Initially I had brought out more shoes like the ones I was wearing, but they aren’t what people actually put on. Then that completes - the teacher finishes teaching the dance and they do it. There’s never a show, but there is a sense of accomplishment like something got finished. People start filing out of this old cafeteria. It morphs a little because the area I’m standing in suddenly is a larger lobby type area and my super comfy bed is in it. I’m exhausted, so while there are a few people still milling about, I get in my bed and fall asleep. Now I have no clothes on at all and I’m trying to sleep naked. I can feel how comfortable my bed is and how tired I am. In my head, I’m thinking how grateful I am that I have a bed. I feel someone come behind me and can hear people talking, sort of murmuring. I’m not exactly clear what they’re saying. But this person snuggles up to spoon behind me and all of a sudden my body is super tense because I have no idea who that is and I’m not wearing any clothing. I continue to hear talking but I don’t know what anyone is saying. When I look down at the arm around my waist, it’s this old arm with liver spots on the hand and the skin is hanging off. I can feel the bile in my throat start to rise. Then all of a sudden, I feel the traditional Sunday morning dick in the back and I’m a little peeved. I turn around and look and it’s this old, old man. It’s him and his friend who have crawled into bed. They also just want to sleep, but they are not realizing that 1, it’s my bed, and 2, I don’t have clothes and 3, it’s so inappropriate for them to be poking me. So I turn around and I start yelling at them to get out. They’re a little embarrassed but there’s also this vibe of lecherousness. I’m so mad and I kick them out. Then I get out of bed and put my clothes on. There were actually people around watching this go down. I’m pissed. I’m so mad that they would even dare to encroach on my space or that somebody else would encourage them to do so. Then the dream shifts and I’m in a lobby of a Crossfit gym. A friend of mine is there and it’s the same friend from the dream two nights ago. I’m happy to see her and she’s happy to see me as well. But then she starts talking and asks me, who do I think I am to come back into her life and pretence like nothing ever happened, and for me to influence people around her to see her in a different way. And who do I think I am to think that her friends would be so forgiving of me and welcoming me back into the crowd. I’m really shocked hearing her say this, because she absolutely on one hand said she missed me and wanted to try to repair and fix the friendship, and on the other hand is completely berating me. I’m so confused and definitely hurt. I can feel myself backing away, trying to get out and away of this entire situation, taking the hint that she’s not interested and I need to leave.",Rose,last_nights_dream
272,1316,,24/02/2020,02/24/2020 00:03,"“Lima” This dream starts as though I’m in the large warehouse style building where I took art classes for a little while when I was 20. I lived in Toronto. There’s a function, so it’s quite crowded and there’s a lot of people, most of whom I don’t know. I see the artist who is an old boyfriend. We’re talking for a bit and he now lives overseas. We have a conversation. The conversation is over. I circulate more around with people. The scene quickly deconstructs. I’m sitting on a couch across from another person on the couch in a studio style flat. There’s a large screen TV elevated above a hearth, but there’s no fire. The person sitting there is not anyone I know. I feel like I had a relationship with him, but it’s over and it’s been over for some time. He’s grilling me over a letter I just received in the mail from my friend the artist. I’m reading the letter, it’s two pages long and there’s a lot of information in it. First I scan it. Then the person on the other side of the couch says, “Did he say anything to you personally?” I say, “No, it’s just news.” Then I’m reading it again. There’s a story about his cat named Lima. I’m thinking, “Oh no, what’s happened to him?” because he has two of them and he’s really quite attached to them. So I zero in on that story. I’m reading that the cat is missing. He’s written that he was working outside painting and as is its habit, the cat came with him. There was a group of kids, an insurgence, playing in the street. They captured the cat and took it. He started looking for it. He tells me in another paragraph that the cat has disappeared for a few days before. The city is surrounded by farmland so the cat has spent some time in the barn. Then my dream scene changes to that actual farm. I see the actual cat in the barn. Then I continue reading the letter where he says that he hopes that’s what has happened this time and he hopes the cat will come back and he’s probably just hiding from the kids that were bullying it and poking it with sticks and stuff. There's other things in the letter. I’m trying to read them, but the person on the other side of the couch continues to say what’s in the letter like he knows what’s in the letter and he’s going off about what’s in the letter. And I’m like, “That’s not what’s in here.” Then the scene quickly deconstructs to me and I’m over in the UK, which is a trip I’ve been planning for a little while. One of the reasons for the conversation with my friend the artist is that maybe I would stop in and visit him and his family when I’m over there. So now I’m over there in the UK and the scenery goes by really fast. I’m at different historical sites, moving through stone buildings, sitting and lying in beautiful lush green grassy places and staring up at the sky. I’m in a rustic market and buying fresh fruit. Then I’m in a busier city with cobblestones and buildings that are narrow and reach upwards to the sky. There’s wrought-iron around the windowsills and it’s gorgeous in a historical city like way. So I come to my friend’s flat and knock on the door. It’s in this rustic part of town. He opens it and I come in and sit down. I love his studio apartment. All the walls are filled with canvases and paintings. Every niche of it has books and art supplies. It’s so warm and colorful and full of creative power. I instantly feel really at ease because it’s similar to my own place. I sit down in a chair and he’s asking me how my trip was. I’m describing the sites and sounds and smells. He says, “Yes, one of my daughters is here.” Then his face looks really crestfallen and sad. He says, “I haven’t had contact with my other one for some time. She transitioned.” That’s all he says. I know from that remark that she’s moved into the body she identifies with. She now identifies as masculine. His other daughter is in the next room and she’s with some of her friends. They’re watching something on television. I go in and sit down in the chair beside her and join in the conversation for a little bit. She tells me that her name is not Gwen and she’s changed it to Grassy. I say, “Oh, that’s a nice name. I like it. It suits you.” She says thank you. We have a little bit more conversation and I leave her to her friends, saying, “It was nice to see you.” I give her a hug and go back into the other room. I’m talking to my artist friend. I say, “Oh, Gwen has changed her name to Grassy.” He says, “Yes, each of them are exploring their own identity. Sometimes I feel like I can’t keep up with it.” Then I say, “Well, they’ve each got some of you in them.” He kind of laughs and I ask him if he’s found his cat. He says, “No, not yet.” And I say, “Well, I saw the cat.” And I described the picture I saw of the farm and the barn. He says, “Hmm, let’s just go check that out.” We gather up our things, leave out the flat door and that’s where I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I cam inside and told my mom about it in attempt to reassure that it was friendly and got along with our cat, all in the hopes that we might keep it.   It became clear that my mom was not to keep the cat and we got in an argument and a physical altercation. I was lying on the floor and she grabbed me and would not let me go to look after the cat which she may have previously let out or scared away.  I repeatedly shouted at her to ""Get the fuck away from me!"" because she was making me so angry that I knew that if she did not leave me alone that I would hit her and hurt her.

I wasn't sure if I could get away with this however and was worried that I'd be caught and that my drug use would be exposed.  I went out into the yard and began to inspect the mushrooms. My dad joined me and we both agreed that they were far too overgrown and ripe to be any good for psychedelics as their chemical components would have long-since expired.

We weren't sure how someone else had gotten into the game.  In any event, we got too close to the chase and the cops came after us. We had to smash one of the cop cars and get away. It was as if we were our life-size selves but also in the video game such that the cars were like toys and we could easily destroy them or move them with our hands.  We left this scene and found ourselves on the top of a tall telescoping or terraced hill. It was very green and surrounded by mist. There was some sort of conflict nearby. As we approached, we saw that there was an army and maybe some skirmish which had been resolved. Possibly a civil war even. I found that I had a gun on my person and as a group of soldiers were approaching me I hid it under my shirt by my stomach. But as they drew closer and were going to question me, I carefully withdrew it and set it down on the ground slowly to make sure that there could be no misinterpreting my motives.  I thought that this was successful, but they surrounded me and I found that they were preparing to execute my by firing squad. I managed to cause a diversion, maybe by pulling out a gun, and dove headlong off the side of the terraced hill. I flew or fell all the way to the bottom where I landed and was able to escape into the mist avoiding the bullets which were coming after me. I may have felt one of them hit or graze me but it did no significant damage.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

We’re all the age we are now and many of us are not in the same dancing shape we were in college. I’m talking with Katie McGee who was at the time getting her a PhD in Psychology while I was undergrad. Now she’s becoming more known in the field of self improvement, psychology and stress. We’re talking about our time as dancers and I’m asking her if she ever comes back and takes classes. She answers, “Occasionally.” Then we go in and it’s like it always was - a big open space with tall windows and curtains from floor to ceiling. It brings back a lot of good memories. There’s a baker who has set up a little stand. She is a famous baker (though I don’t know about her in waking life). She’s known for her scones. I stand in line and see this delicious cake. I order a slice and am thinking of what to get for my son. I want something that’s not very sweet. I’m trying to tell her that I want the least sweet thing she has. She can’t hear me because there’s a lot of construction sounds in the background. I end up yelling, “Least sweet! Least sweet! The not sweet one.” She finally understands me. She’s looking down at me from a platform and says, “Well, everything is sweet here.” Then she pulls a chunk of brown bread of the wall and gives it to me. She also gives me brown bread for me, too, so I don’t get the piece of pie I thought I ordered. I thank her and nipple on it. People have cleared out of the space now. There’s a threat - like a terrorist. But I’m not concerned yet. I see an empty Valentine’s Day card and write on it. It’s a lacy card that goes in a sheer lacy bag. I write a love note to the baker telling her how much I love her baked goods. Now the threat is real. Everyone scatters. The lights are turned off. I somehow am able to get out and we’re no longer on the Stanford campus. We’re at a restaurant by a lake and being served food. We hear gunshots and I learn that somebody is bleeding inside. But I’m safe for now. Then time passes. It seems like it’s finally safe to go. Then as I’m getting ready to go, I realize I’m not wearing any underwear or a bra, only a robe. I need to get a bunch of stuff together quickly and find a drawer with lingerie. I have a choice of 2 black bras - 1 plain and 1 lace - and I’m trying to decide what to bring.

281,1317,,26/02/2020,02/26/2020 00:03,"“Whose Room Will Be Whose?” In my dream last night, I am part of a family that’s moving in with another family. I guess there are parents in the dream because I’m a teenager, but we never see the parents that belong to us. So, the family that lived there before we lived there still have some of their stuff in some of the rooms. We are going through the whole house deciding whose room will be whose. There's two boys in the other family we're going to be blended with. I have at least one sister, although it’s never quite clear the extent of our family because there’s more bodies in that house looking at rooms than just two boys and two girls. The house was originally an older house and the family before us added on other things and made it into a very big house. So in the kitchen, which I’m thinking the original one would have actually been quite beautiful - we go upstairs and then there’s a landing. The stairs open up with three stairs that go to one side and three stairs that go straight and three stairs that go to the other side. So the original kitchen would have been three sides and then open on the fourth side. But now there’s two rooms that go off - one straight ahead and one to the side, so there’s been two walls that have been put up. Now the kitchen is very tiny. It’s long. There’s a counter, a sink, a stove and some cupboards above that. One room that the family before us has put up a wall so there’s no doorway left, so you have to turn your body sideways to get in. It looks like the father of the previous family has made it into a computer room, but what blows my hair back when I walk into the room sideways is the number of intricacies of all these different parts and different computers. There’s 4 monitors and all these tools and it’s like he builds computers. There’s stuff stashed literally everywhere from floor to ceiling. Then somebody from the other family is in there and I'm surprised because I didn’t realize they had this other kid, but she’s sitting and she’s involved with something that goes on with the computer screen. There’s what appears to be two of her friends standing around watching her do this. She makes this one comment to me when I’m in there: The dad has a Swedish computer and it’s hard to find anything else that fits with all these cords and parts and pieces. So I leave back out that room and think, “Well that definitely can’t be my room.” I go into the next one - it’s really small, it only has a single bed in it and a tiny dresser. The walls are poured concrete. I turn around, go back down the stairs, and go on to the lower level which has a bathroom in it and a laundry room and these three enormous bedrooms. As I go in there, I see one that’s long enough that I could set up my craft table and my yoga mat. There’s all kinds of things I can do in that room with the space because it fits more than just the bed and the dresser. But as I’m walking toward it, the older boy from the family we’re blending with says, “This is my room.” Then the other room seems to go to the other boy, which leaves one more room that’s only 3 walls and is exposed on the third side, so I don’t want that room. Then as I turn around, the space that’s between the bottom of the stairs and where the rooms branch off to is a really, really big landing and it’s got some more of these intricate parts and pieces and cubby holes and things that are just filled with stuff that has belonged to the family before us. I’m just looking at it, fascinated with all these parts and the way they’re organized - highly organized. In fact, one drawer, I pull it out and there’s tools that are organized in chronology of increments that must be no more than 1mm apart. Apparently, they’re for the Swedish computer. So nobody else’s computers or electronics or things that you plug in are fitting in this house, so there’s this kerfuffle about finding other parts that are compatible. While I’m looking at all this, there’s this other girl that I didn’t realize the family had and she indicates the shelves that are currently full of tools and things: “This Is where I’m going to put my gun collection.” There’s nowhere for me to put anything between the family’s stuff that is already there and this other extended family we’re blending with that’s taking all the rooms. There's nowhere for me to be here. Then I go into the washroom and decide I’m going to have a bath. While I’m in the bathroom, there's people coming and knocking on the door and needing their stuff. That’s where the dream ends.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

284,1112,,27/02/2020,02/27/2020 00:02,"My brother (the one born right after me) and I are hanging onto a brown balloon - it’s shaped like a physioball and is big enough for both of us to be laying on it with our stomachs on it and our arms around it. This ball/balloon is floating up so high we can see the Earth and all the continents and oceans. But the ball is slowly losing air and we’re getting lower and lower. It’s getting smaller and we keep readjusting our grip - grabbing more of the ball to pull ourselves back up because it’s getting smaller and our position is not as stable on it. While the ball is getting lower, we’re going over some parts of the land where I can see castle ruins in some places and they look like medieval castles and some look like those gorgeous buildings in Russia. They’re different styles of castles, but it’s all ruins and no humans have been there in a long time. Then we’re floating over the ocean and the ball is getting closer to the ocean. I look down and begin to panic because I can see the ocean is vast and incredibly deep. Both my brother and I do not want to land in that ocean with this balloon. So I manage to adjust the balloon so the part where you blow the air in is near my mouth. I start to blow air into it all while hanging on and floating through the sky. I get the balloon a little bit bigger and before when we were up at space-height we were able to direct which way the balloon was going, but once we got further down, we couldn’t direct it until I blew more air into it. It gives us enough time to have control over its direction long enough to land someplace where there’s water, more land and ruins. These ruins look like metal buildings that are all rusted. We land on a metal ledge and there are huge elephants with really long tusks and they’re essentially killer elephants who are not so happy to see two humans in their territory. It’s very clearly their territory. So now my brother and I have left the balloon and we’re trying to run away. There’s parts we have to swim across because these ruins are in water. Some swimming has to happen and we’re not particularly quick swimmers, but we’ve somehow met up with a different group of elephants that want to help us. Each of us grabs onto the back of one and they swim us across these expanses to the next section of metal of these buildings. Now we’re at a section where we have to climb up. I don’t know how the elephants climb up, but some of them do. My brother and I are climbing and it’s like free-solo style climb up this metal wall, hooking our hands into rivets or other handholds on beams. We’re climbing up and trying to go as quickly as possible because there’s a herd of super angry elephants that are red at this point and chasing us. So we get up top of this building. Now it’s very jungly. The water is way down below, but there is jungle plant life all around us. We’re stuck at the top and now there are multiple groups of elephants and other things trying to get to us to kill us. My brother and I are with some other people, but I’m not sure who they are or when we met up with them or how they got there. We’re at the top of this building and all of a sudden there’s all these monkeys and apes climbing up. They’re positioning themselves on the edge directly below where we are. They’re there to defend us and make sure nothing gets to us. I reach down to say thank you to one of the apes that looks like a baboon. They reach up and they keep saying, “You’re so loved!” Essentially, they are all there to sacrifice themselves so that we are safe. I am aware that I’m lucid and crying in real life as I hear these apes or monkeys saying that and they are actually going to keep us safe from these angry elephants.",Rose,last_nights_dream

286,1113,,28/02/2020,02/28/2020 00:01,"I am with a bunch of my sisters/friends from this timeline and time period and we are at one of their houses. It’s a huge expansive place. The house is big, the front yard is big. There’s a table set up at the front because we are celebrating somebody’s birthday, I’m not sure whose. Maybe we’re celebrating everybody’s birthday. We’re all there with our kids and the kids are running around. There’s lights strung from the trees. The table in the front is a really long picnic table and it's covered with food because we’re all eating at the table. It feels incredibly expansive and joyful. There’s lots of coming and going in and out of the house and lots of conversations happening at the table. I’m kind of wandering around. At one point I notice my daughter is running around with a friend's daughter and my son is somewhere playing in the dirt. I am having a conversation with a good friend. That seems to be the entire point of the dream. At one point I carry more food out to the table and sing happy birthday to somebody - or some sort of congratulation is happening. Then the dreams shifts a little and I’m talking with a friend of mine (in real time and in this timeline) - someone I’ve met over Instagram - but we are face-to-face in this part of the dream and that feels nice because we seem to totally get each other. I'm chatting with her and she all of a sudden says, “Oh, there’s this man I want you to meet.” She says his name and it starts with C - I want to say it’s Cyril or something but I don’t quite catch it. I can feel that a part of me is questioning. The scene around me has changed, too. I’m no longer at this big wide expansive home. I’m at her home and it’s so open. We are standing outside in a driveway and her house is behind her in the backyard and there is a garage to our right. We’re near the garage but we are outside and it is dusk now. A porchlight is on. This guy pulls up on a motorcycle and she’s like, “This is the person I want you to meet.” He’s got this leather jacket and his hair is longish and curly or wavy and dark. Yes, he’s definitely good looking, but all my alarm bells are going off because he’s riding a motorcycle and wears a leather jacket - how cliche. And he’s got tattoos. She says, “Oh, he’s a plant medicine maker, so he knows how to make medicine from plants.” That peaks my interest because you don’t meet a lot of men who know how to do that. But I’m still feeling like I’m being put on the spot and I don't appreciate matchmaking. It feels awkward because I know he’s been invited there to meet with me. I don’t like those kind of situations. I would much rather there be an organic conversation where you’ve met or something. In this part of the dream I am feeling so awkward with meeting this guy. But I’m still feeling tender feelings for my friend - I still love her very much and I don't care that she’s set me up with this dude. I think it’s kind of funny. Anyway, I’m not into it. In the next part of the dream, I’m taking him and a couple friends on a tour. The dream switches scenes again. Now I’ve left my friend who has done the introductions, but this guy is with me. He’s off the motorcycle at this point and there are other guys with him. They’re his friends, I think, but they’re all strangers to me. I’m giving them a tour of what I think is my old high school, but it’s in the snow and my old high school was in Hawaii. So this version of my high school is somewhere in the snow - there’s lots of ice. We get in a car and I’m driving them up and around the drive that usually takes us to the school. We drive past the chapel part I grew up going to, past the admissions building. I’m taking them onto campus because these guys are all going to run a race. So it’s a bunch of hotshot runners or super athletic guys. Again I’m asking myself, “Why am I with all these guys? Why am I showing them around?” So we actually end up driving past the beginning of the race and we have to go park way down below in a parking lot. To get to the beginning of the race is a ton of stairs covered in snow and ice. Now because it took a while to drive around, school has let out, so there’s a bunch of students out and it’s really really crowded. So these men I’m leading around are getting a little bit frustrated because it’s taking extra long to get to the race. They’re worried they’re going to miss it - it’s a running, cross country race. It’s cold and they’re in their running shorts - not my problem. I lead them up to the beginning of the race through all these stairs. We’re winding our ways through the crowds, being careful not to slip on the ice. The headmaster of the school comes to greet us. What’s interesting is that the school now has a ton of people of color going to it, including black people, but these guys I’m bringing with me are all white. This is interesting because I’m noticing as we’re walking through the crowd, the guys I’m leading are being rude. They’re totally trying to use their white male dominance to move themselves through this crowd. They’re pissing a lot of people off. So the headmaster meets me, and the headmaster in this dream is actually the head of the Waldorf School my kids currently go to now. Her name is Cecilia and she’s a woman of color. She meets me and helps me lead these men to the start of the race. But she is giving them a lecture on white male privilege, dominance, the patriarchy and their atrocious behavior. There’s a part of me rubbing my hands in glee, getting to listen to Cecilia school these men who have been incredibly arrogant. We get to the start of the race, which is interesting, because it’s actually through a bunch of buildings and they have to race through a bunch of doorways before they can get outside. It’s literally doorways and Cecilia has had me go open up some of the doors so they know which doors to go through. I mark them somehow, so there’s literally a little note that says, “Run through this door,” so they can find their way to the outside, because there is an outside part of this race, but it literally starts in a building and they have to run through these doorways. Now Cecilia has been joined by a male teacher of color who is continuing the lesson and lecture for these white men who are all still in their running gear - short shorts, tennis shoes, a sweater because it’s cold. They are finishing up this lecture and the white men are part of this other group. The other group has people of color in it. They’re not in the front to start this race. I really don't know how it’s going to go because everyone has to run through these doors and these doors are not lined up one after the other. You run through a door, then you have to hang a right to go through another door. It’s quite maze-like until you get out. But they’re all set up, ready to go, and the lecturing is done. Sure enough, somebody shoots off one of those little start guns and they start running through. The dream ends there.",Rose,last_nights_dream
287,1318,,28/02/2020,02/28/2020 00:02,"“The Motorcycle Trip” My dream setting begins in what appears to be a parking lot of sorts on a pier beside a lake. There's a medium amount of people, not too crowded but certainly not sparsely populated by people walking around enjoying the fresh air. It’s a large body of water. It feels more like the Great Lakes as opposed to the ocean. I am there with a woman and a man. The man, although I seemed to know him in an arm’s length traveling companion kind of way, I don’t energetically feel like I know him very well. We don’t speak to each other in the dream, we just travel together. The woman feels like my daughter, although she doesn not know how to drive or own a motorcycle either. I suspect she’d be a little scared to do that. We all three have motorcycles. My motorcycle has a tray on the back - it’s quite wide, a little wider than the bike, I’d say it’s about 18 inches wide. There’s cutlery on it - knives, spoons and forks. There’s probably 60 pieces of cutlery on this, it’s quite thick and they fill the tray. We talk about it being time to leave and I realize that I need to get ready. So I gather the few things together I have for this trip. I start my motorcycle, so do the other two people and we begin to travel. We leave the pier and drive down a street, through the city, onto the highway. All the while, this cutlery is shifting around and rattling on the back of my motorcycle. I am a little worried it’s going to slide off the try and onto my body. It doesn’t, however. We travel through the day. I’m not wearing a helmet and it actually feels kind of nice. I’m navigating driving this bike rather well. Now I realize we are heading to a campground. I did not know this when we left the pier and I don’t have any camping equipment with me. It’s supposed to rain and I feel like I need to have something that will protect the motorcycle while it’s raining. So I tell my two traveling companions this. The man doesn’t seem happy about stopping, but my daughter is fine with it. We pull into a Canadian Tire. They stay outside in the parking lot waiting for me while I go into the store, and I’m looking around. I can’t even find a section dedicated to motorcycles, there’s nothing. All there seems to be is camping equipment, so I pick out a tent. I’m looking for a tarp for the motorcycle. There’s nothing, so I think maybe I’ll just get an expanse of plastic fabric and a piece of rope and I’ll drape it over the bike and tie with the rope so the wind doesn’t blow it off. So I’m looking for the measurements for this tarp and an employee approaches me and says, “Can I help you?” I say, “Yes, I’m looking for a piece of tarp that I can put over my motorcycle.” Instead of answering me about the dimensions, which I have asked, because they’re written in some language I don’t understand, they’re not in centimeters or inches, he steers me to this really expensive roll of tarp that’s on a complicated system with large wheels and probably weight 200 pounds and has 18 miles of tarp on it and it’s thousands of dollars. I say, “No, I just need a small piece that will fit over my bike.” He acts like he doesn’t understand what I want. I repeat, “What are these measurements? How can I convert them to centimeters or inches?” Instead of answering me, he just walks away and I’m left in this aisle, not knowing how big anything is. So I don’t buy anything from there and think maybe a large barbecue cover will go over my bike. So at this point, my daughter comes into the store and says, “What have you been doing?” She names the guy and says, “He’s getting impatient. We have to go. We need to get to the campsite before it starts raining. I say, “I haven’t been able to find a tarp yet. I’m going to the barbecue section.” So she comes with me. I estimate that this one really large barbecue tarp will fit over it. I hope it will and she doesn’t give me time to select a length of rope. I purchase the tent and the cover and we exit the store. I see a picnic area and there’s bits of rope lying around the picnic table. It must be the employees lunch break area and they’ve used that space to unwrap incoming boxes and produce to stock the shelves. So I gather up some lengths of twine and tie them together and feel that this will be enough rope. We all get back on our motorcycles. I place the tent and the tarp in the saddlebag and we continue on down the highway to the campground. The campground is fairly crowded because we are late. We take the remaining campsite that’s left. The silent man sets up his tent, crawls in it and he’s done - we don’t see him again for the rest of the trip. My daughter and I help each other set up our own camping area. She gathers some wood. I fiddle with the tarp, trying to place it overtop the motorcycle, which I do, and successfully wrap it with the rope. I feel fairly pleased that I’ve Macgyvered this makeshift tarp. My daughter arrives back with the wood and we build ourselves a nice fire. We just sit there warming our hands on it. Suddenly I have more twine, I guess it’s leftover from the bike and I use it to tie down any flaps from the tent because we are expecting a fair amount of wind and rain. I reach into my pocket and I have a small bag of dehydrated food and I tell her, “Oh, we even have cutlery. I’ve a whole bunch on the back of my bike.” So I reach under the tarp, grab enough cutlery for us. And I say, “Look, here’s the cutlery for the whole rest of the people that will be gathering here tomorrow. I’ve brought this to share with everyone.” So she seems happy about this. We eat our dehydrated food with water we have from a different pocket. Then I take the dishes and wash them out in a community sink. I see that most other people have crawled into their tents already in preparation for this gathering tomorrow. My daughter and I douse the fire, make sure the coals are out, then we crawl into our own tents to sleep.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

290,1114,,29/02/2020,02/29/2020 00:02,"The first one is me someplace warm, at least I’m wearing a tanktop and shorts. I have protectors around me and I don't feel I’m in danger, but I do feel I’m new. I’m learning some things, so I need guidance and someone or something to keep an eye on me and that’s exactly what I have. I’m actually learning to fly and to use some of my other superpowers. So my two protectors are there to show me how to do the things and make sure I don’t hurt myself. One is golden in color and I keep seeing a lion or mountain lion as the shape of this particular protector, but they tend to shapeshift into human form, too. When this lion or mountain lion is in human form, it’s a male with blonde/gold hair and green eyes and nicely chiseled body. The other protector is a black jaguar with wings. It has big black wings on it and it flies around and shows me how to fly - that’s one of the things I’m trying to learn. I keep seeing places that look very similar to my childhood home in this dream. I’m on a balcony and this balcony reminds me of the balcony that was outside my parents’ bedroom. The view from it looks like the view from my house which is looking out onto a lava rock desert that’s got dried grasses and smaller shrubs growing. The grasses are all golden in color, too. I’m aware of my protectors’ presence. I do see them fly off on occasion, go take care of things and come back. I’m just observing the whole time, trying to figure out how to fly, myself. I’m aware that they are going off to fight things, then they come back. I’m a little concerned because I don’t want them to get hurt, but they seem to be fine every time. Then the dream shifts a little bit to another spot where I’m walking across and open space - kind of a grassy space, but I can feel there are other things around me like maybe trees and possibly houses, but I’m not completely aware of what is around me. I just know there is enough space for me to practice my flying and I’m in human form for this. I start walking and the black jaguar is with me. He’s encouraging me not to start flying, but I’m not really listening and doing it anyway. So I start running as fast as I can, and sure enough, I take a leap and it launches me into the air. I start flying up and up and up. I can control it. I can direct it. I can make myself go in the direction I want to go in. One of the guardians is with me flying - I can't tell which one. I’m doing a really good job of flying around. I have a particular direction I head - it’s towards a taller apartment complex. I’m heading there because there's a particular balcony I want to land on but I can’t remember why or what I’m doing. But I have purpose, I just don’t remember what it is. I’m mostly impressed that I am actually flying because it seems there are so many dreams when you want to fly and you run and run and run but never get off the ground. But in this one I do. Then a couple dream segments go by, which I can’t remember. It’s totally shifted now. I’m in a cave and this cave is also a bar. There’s a huge dance party going on, like a rave. I have no idea why I’m there because I don’t do raves and I don’t drink. It’s also late and I don’t like to stay up late. The people in this rave are all my high school classmates and they are the last people I want to see. I don’t want to interact with them. I don’t want to know what they’ve all been doing for the last 20 years because I definitely feel I won’t have anything cool to share and there will be a lot of judgment around where I find myself currently in terms of accomplishments in life. I also have a very thick layer of judgment around the fact that they all still drink together and that’s what they do, and their friendship is based on having drank alcohol for the last 20 years and that just in no way excites me. I don’t want to be around it. So as I’m in this crowd, I’m making sure to avoid all my classmates and not be seen by them. I’m trying to get out of the cave so I can be outside because the cave is dark and imposing. I don’t want to be in that kind of place - it’s too heavy. I want to be out where there’s sunshine and fresh air. So I make my way out. My hair is down and I’m wearing shorter shorts and a crop top. I do seem to be dressed for clubbing, but I’m not into it. I make my way out of the cave - the cave is where the dancing is happening - and on my way out is where the bar is. First I pass a little waterfall that’s coming down this rock cliff. The cave is all rock, but the entrance is also rock and it’s open on one side, but there’s rock on the other. The side that has the rock wall is where the bar is. I’m wanting to go past the bar because I can see above this rock wall, it shifts into green grass that goes up an incline for quite a ways. Beyond the green grass, I can see forest is starting. I want to head up that way. I can also see that halfway up this hill, there’s a ton of people milling about. It’s almost like this grassy area and hill is a tourist destination that people climb up to go see. It reminds me of the Tor in England, but it’s definitely not a sacred site in that way. Halfway up this hill is a plateau with a round circle that reminds me of a caldera - the inside of a volcano. Inside is a bunch of workout bikes, like exercise bikes. I want to go up there and go get some exercise in. So I can see my destination - I can see where I want to go. But I have to get past this bar and all of my classmates first. I can see that the wall of the bar which is all rock similar to the cave is kind of consuming people. I can see it curl in and it doesn’t eat them or kill them, but they never really come out once it curls up and over them. I can see this happening, so I want to get out as quick as I can. But I have to go past and the last group of people on my way out is all my classmates. I’m just watching them and staying pretty hidden because it’s very easy for me to pull a veil over me. Even though I’m very noticable, I’ve pulled a veil around me and they can't see me. So I’m just observing and watching as they’re drinking and dancing and yelling at each other. It seems like they’re having a good time, but I still don’t want any part of it. One of my friends from high school - a particular classmate who happens to be in my dreams pretty often - she’s the bartender and she is singing and rapping and entertaining everyone while they’re dancing. I’m really just wanting to scooch by and all of a sudden I realize I don't have my phone and my phone is somewhere back in that cave. I don’t want to go back in it because I see that now the cave is somehow consuming people and I don’t want to do that. But I catch this friend’s eye and she sees that I’m trying to get out. She seems cool with it and I tell her I can’t go because I don't have my phone. She says, “Don’t worry. I’ll go get it.” She goes in to get it. Meanwhile, I’m watching the rest of my friends dance, but also disappear. I can see that the rock wall of the bar is coming up and it’s cresting over me like a wave. There is water under me. I have to dive down as fast as I can and dive forward as fast as I can to get out in front of this rock wave that’s curling. I do, but of course I’m totally panicked. It only takes me once and I’m in front. My friend shows up and hands me my phone and I can leave. I get out of there as fast as I can, leaving all my friends having a great time partying. I’m at this point completely panicked because I’ve almost been consumed. I get out of there as fast as I can and head up towards the green. While I’m on my way out, this couple introduces themselves to me. They come out of nowhere. They don’t speak English and I don’t speak their language, but somehow we are communicating and talking. They want to introduce me to their son or daughter whoever it is. But I’m so desperate to get out at this point that i say, “It’s nice to meet you, and I hope you enjoy your visit here.” They’re visiting and somehow I know this even though neither of us are speaking each other’s language. Then the dream shifts to a grocery store parking lot. I’m showing up there because there’s some sort of meeting like an AA meeting, or a meeting of people coming together for a particular cause, but it’s one of those info sessions then they try to sell you something. I’m standing there trying to gather the information and feeling this information is really important. In the end I realize they are just trying to get me to join their church or cult or whatever it is. It’s something I don't want to join and I’m so disappointed that I wasted my time standing in this parking lot when I could have been doing something else. I get in my car and drive away. Then the dream shifts to something else but I don’t remember it.",Rose,last_nights_dream
291,1319,,29/02/2020,02/29/2020 00:03,"“The Facility” In this dream, I open my eyes and I see a snowy day. It’s very cold out. I’m telling someone what my dream was. I tell them that it begins at a facility and the setting is beyond high ceilings. There's painted brick walls, stainless steel appliances and really long tables - stretched picnic tables with benches along either side that would seat 40 people. I’m seated at one of these. There’s hooks beside the bench that have years hanging on them and lifetimes hanging from another one. They’re stretched out like husks of people but they’ve been elongated, like really, really long jumpsuits. There’s a guest speaker here. She’s there either to reset someone’s year or their entire lifetime. I’m telling her which person is there for what - either their year or their lifetime. Someone continually asks me what I’m there and every time someone asks me, I’m finding it hard to remember. I have to pause and think about it again. Then in the setting, I’m a participant again. As I’m telling her my story, she’s interrupting me like she doesn’t believe me. In the retelling of it, she’s speaking it again. She’s mixing up the facts on her own. At the same time, she’s telling me that she doesn’t believe me. I’m both questioning her credibility and getting frustrated by not being able to retell my own story. So l leave the room with the long benches and the stainless steel appliances and the hooks. I walk down the hallway and I go somewhere else in the building. The hallway after I left the facility was Central Senior school hallways. While I’m doing that, I meet another person who says, “What were you doing here today?” I say, “I was here in the dream room to reset my life and the guest speaker is a liar.” As I’m retelling that, the scenery changes and I’m in my great grandmother’s house, my Great Grandma Mac. I’m in the kitchen and I’m making food for some people that are sitting at her kitchen table. I tell them the experience of my dream room as I’m cooking. I ask them what they want to eat at the same time as I'm retelling my experience in the dream room. Then there’s some crackers on the counter. I pick one of them up and start nibbling and I realize it’s a wheat cracker and I can’t eat wheat, it upsets my stomach, but I’m eating it anyway. The people at the table look at me with surprised faces and raised eyebrows. I realize that now they’re questioning my authenticity about not being able to eat wheat because I’m nibbling on this sweet cracker. I go downstairs with the cracker. I finish eating it. Suddenly, there’s an identical one in my other hand. I eat that one as well. Then I come back up the stairs to the kitchen. I look out the window and it’s a beautiful snowy day. I realize that we need to be packing up to leave. So I go down the hallway to the bedroom and there’s two people in it, a female and a male. I sit on the edge of the bed. I’m telling them about my experience in the dream room. But as I’m telling the story, the woman gets out of the bed, sits on the end of it and then I get in the bed and continue retelling the story to the male. He’s not understanding what I’m talking about. So I sit paritaly up and I’m pressing my palms against the bed. My lower body is still lying on its side. My upper body is more upright. I say, “It’s like looking out a window and you’re elevated and it’s a snowy day, and there’s a really long laneway that goes down the hill and across a field and it keeps going because your perspective has a long range before there’s a forested area. You see that laneway disappear into it.” As I’m describing it, I’m placing my finger on the bed and I actually feel the bumps in the laneway of all the tracks that have gone over that laneway repeatedly over and over. I can feel the texture of them under my finger. With my other hand, I run it down his arm from his shoulder down the skin of his arm to his fingertips. Then I get up out of the bed, I go across the hallway and I see my great grandmother. She’s sitting on a couch in the other bedroom with two men. She’s naked. It looks like they’re having some kind of elderly threesome. I think to myself, “Oh!” I’m surprised. And then I think, “Way to go Grandma!” Then I walk down the hallway back to the kitchen and I say, “It’s time to go. Everybody gather your things up please.” So people start packing. I go down to the basement, pack my own suitcases and pick them up. Then the scenery deconstructs and reconstructs and I’m in my car but alone. I’m driving around a city block. But it’s slippery. I’m trying to gup a hill in my car, but there's no traction. I almost get to the top of the hill and then my car slides back to the bottom. Then I drive around the block again trying to get traction to go up this hill and the car again slides down to the bottom because there’s no traction. So when I’m driving around the block again and trying to get traction, I turn right into this driveway. It’s an elbow bend. I have to turn right again in the driveway, then I’m in this parking lot behind a walkup style apartment building. There’s one window that stretches up from the top floor down to the bottom floor. I realize that I’m looking into the back of someone’s apartment - there’s no curtains on it - and I’m not supposed to be there. It’s an accident that I am. I didn’t mean to peer into the details of this person's life. So I turn the car around in the very tiny parking lot, try to back out and again there’s a hill and I’ve got no traction. I get almost up to the top and my car slides back down. Now I’m feeling compromised. I feel like I’m spying on someone. The scene deconstructs and I’m back again in the room and I’m telling this woman this part of the story - the one that’s there to reset either your life or just the past year. Now I can’t remember if I’ve told her I want to reset my life or just the year. I look at the hooks to see if I recognize any of the husks and will it give me a hint as to why I’m actually there.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

297,1115,,02/03/2020,03/02/2020 00:01,"I’m outside living in a village. It’s all native and mixed blood Hawaiians (Philippino, Chinese, Japanese - all of the different ethnicities that live in Hawaii). There is a kumu hula there and a hula halau. The kumu definitely knows their dances and their history and knows the hidden things. I’m accustomed to being in a hula halau, so I go to one of the practices to join, but the kumu tells me no, I’m not allowed because I don’t know. I feel really sad and rejected and also a little bit baffled because they're actually practicing a dance I know. In fact, as I’m watching some of the other hula dancers, they don’t know it as well as I know it. So I’m watching this and the kumu has asked me to leave. So now I’m watching this from afar. I’ve gone away from where they’re doing this practice. They’re doing this practice for a bigger show. So I've backed away and am up on a little bit of a rise. I can see them practicing. I do not understand why they won't let me dance especially since I already know the one they’re doing. So I leave and I follow this man that I know from the village. He takes me into his house and he has so many sacred items and then just stuff. He’s going through it and he’s telling me about why I can’t dance I think, I’m not sure. But I’m watching him going through all of his things and I keep thinking: “Why so much stuff?” Then the scene changes and I’m at an outdoor gala and it’s all rich and famous people. We’re on this grassy lawn and there’s a huge homebehind me that people are coming in and out of. I’m right at the threshold, not quite on the stairs, but I haven't gone into the lawn where most of the party is. I’m just sort of up between. I’m watching everybody mingle. There’s laughing and glasses are clinking and people are drinking and they’re all dressed in their finest. It is daytime out and it’s warm. I see Ted Danson, who is old now and he look very old to me - he is really, really thin and his skin is papery and hanging off his arms and his hair is all white and thinning and stringy and it’s wet like he’s just jumped out of the shower and just gotten ready for this gala. He passes me and I see him walk down into the crowd. He’s talking to people and they’re happy to see him. I’m just taking note of how old he looks, although now I see his hair if fluffier and dry. He looks a little bit better - less old and less frail and fragile with his hair dried out. Then the scene changes yet again and I’m in a parking lot. There’s multiple stores in this parking lot - the Natural Grocers store and two other big box stores all lined up. I’m in the parking lot and it’s full of cars and carts. I’m out there gathering up the Natural Grocers carts and bringing them back to the stall in front of Natural Grocers where people can get them. Then Jake Gyllenhaal, another actor, is standing around. There seems to be a number of famous people milling about in this parking lot, going in and out of the stores and buying things. But I’m pushing carts back to the parking lot in front of the store and I have some of the wrong carts - they’re not the ones to Natural Grocers, so I’m confused as I’m putting some of the carts away. Jake Gyllenhaal is standing next to the cart return kind of trying to be helpful, but really just standing in the way. I’m trying to make polite conversation and maneuver around him to get the carts where they're going. He has some critiques of my methods and I can’t tell if I’m annoyed with the man-splainign, but it is Jake Gyllenhaal and he’s relatively attractive and I can’t tell if I want to flirt with him or not. Mostly I just want to get all the carts. So I leave this cart return and head back out into the parking lot where there is a tangle of carts from all the different stores. My brother, the one who was born right after me, shows up. He’s giving me advice on how to deal with the carts - again more unsolicited advice. He mostly is just saying how I’m doing it wrong and not actually giving me any pointers. I’m a little bit annoyed, but i just keep gathering the carts that are mine. Now I can tell the difference, so I leave the ones that aren’t. I actually have to lift one out of a cart return because it’s sandwiched between all the other carts and I can’t get to it. So I’m gathering and my brother’s following me around and kind of helping to push some of the carts, but not really. He just keeps talking at me. While I like that he’s there because I’m fond of this brother, I`m also annoyed with all his advice and very little help, just standing around watching. Then the dream ends.",Rose,last_nights_dream

I prepared to go out, but my brother told me that I would have to swim by myself for an hour and that he would join me later when it was his turn. I didn't want to do this by myself as I was afraid that I would get too tired and that with my asthma acting up again (as it was in real life at the time) I would not be able to make it.  I decided that instead of swimming we would go kayaking and we got both of the kayaks ready and were out in the middle of the lake.

It was a single lane road and the trees loomed toward us from the right. It may have been after a storm as the branches sagged toward us and some may have even been partially fallen and uprooted. Dad was acting strangely and had difficulty avoiding the trees and kept waking out into the middle of the road where it was more dangerous. I realized that this must be caused by his Alzheimer's and I carefully helped him to reorient himself and proceed down the path.  Upon waking, I was struck by the reality that one day I will have to stand by my parents as they are about to die. The thought fills me with sadness, but I also see the beauty in this and am glad that I will have the strength to be there for them and to take care of them when they need it. I hope this is a long ways off. This dream made me appreciate my parents more and I will try my best to see them soon and to have some good conversations and walks together.

I wasn’t supposed to go to work the next day but a friend called in sick and we needed the money so I left. Not long after I left she had the aneurysm and my little sister didn’t know what to do, resulting in lost time. She was braindead by the time she got to the hospital.

310,790,,05/03/2020,03/05/2020 00:02,"Last night the dream started in a building of some kind and something has been lost and it needs to be recovered. Mary is there and she’s helping me find this. Then other things happen that I can’t recall. I’m on a walk along the coast with a group of people. Ursula is in the front and I’m pretty sure Mary is still with me along with other people. We’re walking along a narrow path to a festival. I look over at the ocean and it’s the most beautiful coastline. I’ve been there before in dreaming life but I don’t recognize it from waking life. Every time I see it, I am thrown into pure joy because of the beauty. It’s the most beautiful blue you’ve ever seen - it’s one little sunny protected coastline without big waves. The water flows smoothly in and out. I throw my arms up in pure ecstasy at the beauty of this landscape. Ursula looks back at me with a judgmental smirk and keeps walking ahead, but it doesn’t change how I feel about this beautiful place on earth. Then we arrive at the festival and I put my bag and shoes down. In doing this, I lose everybody and I’m suddenly alone in a big crowd of people. At first I’m not concerned, but the day goes on towards night. I don’t have my bag, money or shoes and I don't know what I’m going to do for the night. There’s a beautiful wading pool where people go to bless and cleanse themselves after their journey. I see a young man I recognize from chiropractic school in waking life. He’s very kind and he’s with me. We find a little spot to lie down and rest for the night. In the morning, they start breaking down this entryway to the festival. I tell them about my missing bag and shoes. The guy is really helpful and is looking on the upper and lower levels. He says he thinks he saw my shoes and may have seen my backpack, too. He’s looking for me and telling other people to help me look. But they don’t find either thing. I decide to go on and know I’ll find the group of people I’m supposed to meet up with soon enough. Instead I find this beautiful big grassy field and a rope swing. I’m excited to see this. I climb up the rope and I start to swing. I’m looking across the green grass and seeing all the festival stands. People are setting up and selling chai and delicious food and arts and crafts. I see a man I recognize from college. There was an attraction in college of him towards me, but nothing developed. I’m swinging and then I wave at him and I do this marvelous huge swing that ends in a backflip. I land on my two feet with such strength and grace. He looks and applauds. He’s laughing and walks along. I’m looking for my bag again because it has my money and tent supplies. I don’t find it, but I do end up going to a bathhouse where I find some of the people from my group. They are chiropractic colleagues in waking life. They're so happy to see me and say, “Oh Viviane, you can stay! We have an extra space in the master bedroom we rented for the weekend.” But I think I’m going to have to pay for this and I don’t have the money. I am happy to see them. Then I’m wandering through the festival and I’d love a chai, but I don’t have the money. I end up walking out of the festival along a neighborhood path and I see big houses. All of the houses have been turned into communes. People are living together and that’s how they can afford to live in this area of town and they’ve turned this nice area into a community based on communal living homes.",Ana,last_nights_dream

I wasn’t invited, but I was just checking out the place. I had my crystal with me. We go into the temple space and I see crystals inside the walls. One of them matches mine and looks just like mine. I put my crystal up to it to see. Then we needed to go, so we left, but I realized I left my crystal. But I think it was taken. So we go back to find my crystal and we see that Sabrina has it and she’s doing something with it to take the power and energy out of it. I send Carrie to go get it because I don’t want Sabrina to see me. But I can see through Carrie’s eyes or something. I can see what’s happening. So when Carrie sees it, she gets really upset and she goes to try and get the crystal. But she doesn’t have enough power to battle Sabrina. So I step into Carrie and Sekhmet’s in me.

312,1116,,05/03/2020,03/05/2020 00:04,"Multiple parts to this dream, but only a few that really stand out. I am living in an apartment and across the street is where my ex lives with our kids. He’s selling the house they live in. I’m so sad because they're not going to be closeby anymore and he’s going to be having the kids full time. So I won’t get to see them because they’re not there. But what is the most sad is when I walk over to his house - he invited me over to see if I wanted anything from it because he was selling it furnished with all the things in it, including some of the kids’ stuff and some of his stuff and things I had made for the kids. He was leaving it all there, leaving it up to the realtor to sell the house as furnished. At the time I go over, he’s there with our son and our son is going through all his things, grabbing what he wants and leaving the rest. I’m feeling so heartbroken about it - just the fact that they’re moving and the kids are going to be far away and that there’s all these things that are unwanted, uncared for and untended, including things that I have made for the kids. Oddly enough, my daughter is nowhere to be found in this, she’s already moved on. My son is also not incredibly sad. He’s very pragmatic about what he wants to take with him and go. I’m looking around and the house is full and my ex is just leaving all of it where it is. They both leave and I’m really sad when they leave when I say goodbye to my son because I feel like I’m not going to see him again. That feels heartbreaking. Then I’m standing there in what feels like the wreckage of a life. I’m standing there in the house and the realtor comes with a client and is showing the house. I’m there but it’s almost like they can’t really see me. I think it’s odd that this person is contemplating moving into this place with so much stuff still in it. I leave because it feels so heavy to be in there and I go back across the street to my apartment which is just me. I’m sitting on the balcony. There’s a gorgeous view in front of me and I can see the ocean and the curve of a shoreline. It looks like there’s mountains that come down to the edge. It reminds me of Hawaii. There’s a blue towel that I’ve hung on the clothesline out on the lanai. It’s one of the old blue towels that my ex and I inherited when we got married - they were his college towels. It has a hole and a rip in it because those are the towels I use for cleaning up gross things or wiping down dogs. It’s fluttering in the wind in front of me and blocking part of my view. It’s just one of the rattiest towels with a hole in it and it’s all I can focus on. Then other parts of the dream happen, but this one other scene has stuck with me: I’m in a group of people. I’m not sure who all is in it, but there are classmates from high school again. I think we’re inside, but I can’t even tell - that doesn’t seem to matter. There is a fire pit somewhere in the center. It seems to be some sort of gathering or meeting where we’re electing a leader or someone who is going to present a plan to help us out of some sort of pickle that we’re in. We’ve done this before. We’ve been here before. The last time we were all in this circle, there was no consensus. We weren’t able to choose anyone. This time around, the person who is coming to the forefront is somebody who I’ve always had a fondness for and always known was quite brilliant. He and I lock eyes across the circle. He stands up and gives a speech to everyone, which is quite short and something along the lines of: “Just elect me.” I’m realizing that’s not going to convince anyone because he hasn’t told anyone why we should or what his skills are or what he’s good at. So from across the circle, I yell out: “Tell us why you’re qualified!” He kind of goes “oh” and you see it register on his face that he didn't think about saying that before. So then he starts to list off the reasons why. This feels very tribal - the whole thing feels like this was way before current day politics or how we come together in board rooms or how we do meetings. It’s much more a gathering of the tribe, which is why the fireplace. It just feels much more primal than the way we do it now. He lists off all his attributes of why, and of course some of them include: “because I’m strong.” That seems to sway the crowd and everyone agrees on him being the leader. Then the dreams go on, but I do not remember.",Rose,last_nights_dream
313,1321,,05/03/2020,03/05/2020 00:05,"“The Attached Pool” In this dream, I’m in a place that’s very rocky. It looks like Niagara's escarpment and the houses built in that area. The escarpment commission won’t let you change the natural formation of the land in order to build there, so houses are very expensive and you have to go around the rocks with your architecture. So I’m with a couple of other people and they are judgemental about the houses built here and mocking the other people's wealth and ignorantly gossiping about the style of architecture to the extent that they’re just saying it’s stupid. I realize as I’m walking with this crowd of people and picking up on the remarks they're making that I know one of the people that lives in these houses. It’s a woman I taught a teacher training and she’s a nice lady, but her personality is very irritating. I stand still for a moment and the group of people walking behind me walk past. I’m gazing at the house they’re talking about and I see this woman come out of it. I think, “Oh, this is her house.” They’ve built a change room for their pool and it’s like a giant treehouse. It’s unfinished with just dry-wall, but I can see her family coming out of it and they’re changed and ready for the pool. I walk a little closer to look at the pool that everyone was making fun of. The idea is genius. It’s like a large long narrow plexiglass tank that’s obviously been made to fit into the area between the rocks. It’s attached to the foundation of their house on one side and the rocks on the other side and it’s clear, so whatever nature is around it, is seen through the pool. So it’s almost camouflaged - you don’t notice it right away. It’s not finished, however, and there's no water in it. She sees me standing there and invites me in. Part of me thinks, “Oh no,” because she has an annoying personality, and the other part of me is curious how they have done and structured this house. I’m taken by the architecture. I can’t really get out of it anyway without being rude, so I accept the invitation. I think, well I’ll just come in and have tea with them, I don’t have to stay long. So I do. Their house is quite busy. Her husband is expecting this business associate to come in and she’s running around doing stuff. I’m not sure what she’s doing, she’s just really busy. She leaves me sitting at the kitchen table with no tea. I'm just sitting there and this other business associate comes in. I’m thinking, “Wow, he’s getting annoyed that the husband is late.” So, I offer the business associate tea to keep him happy. I have a conversation with the business associate that’s very, very interesting (but I forgot it as soon as I woke up). As I’m offering him tea, he says that he likes chai, but he doesn’t normally order it because people don’t know how to make it. I suggest the ingredients I know of - “What about these? What about ginger root?” and he nods. And I say, “Peppercorns?” and he nods. And I say, “Cinnamon?” and he nods. “Cardamom seed?” More nodding. “Whole cloves?” Nodding. I say, “How does that sound?” I can see them over on the counter. He says, “Yes that would be a good idea.” So I boil the water and while we’re waiting, the woman comes back and says, “Oh good, you’ve started it. I just didn’t have time. Go over there and get some grapes.” So I wash those and offer them to the business associate. She runs off again and I sit there and continue to have a conversation with this business associate. While we’re talking, the scene deconstructs and I’m in a kind of sailboat and I’m in a race. It’s already going on and we’ve turned around. Part of the race is to take a hard bank to the starboard and keep doing it until you’ve done this quick 360 turn and pick up the line of something else you’re supposed to drag. My partner turns the boat and I reach out and I’ve got the rope. We’re dragging this thing. Then immediately I’m in the sky and I’m looking down on the ship and there’s this small child in one of the boats with a suncover pulled right over and a towel over its head. Then I think, “Oh, that's a good idea for sleeping on a boat.” Then we’re on the boat again and the race is over. We’re coasting into a dock, getting off, and the company I’m with say, “Let’s go get something to eat.” And we’re in Mexico. We just start walking into town. The ground is hard packed sand from so many people’s feet walking over it for hundreds of years. It's still warm from the sun. It’s this beautiful reddish brown terracotta color. There’s no ugly black asphalt and I’m grateful for that feeling under my feet. As we walk in, there’s many hastily thrown together pubs made of wood. It’s the kind of wood you see Mexican furniture made out of - I don’t know what it’s called. It’s painted bright colors. We go into one pub, sit down, and there’s nothing on the menu I can eat. It’s all cheese and beef and wheat. I ask if they have chicken. The woman serving us says, “I can get one.” And there’s these chickens running through the restaurant and she picks one of them up and cuts its head off. But the knife isn’t sharp and it takes three heaves to get it through. I`m horrified. Then I leave the table. I guess I can’t stand this in the dream. I walk over to the bar and I think maybe I’ll just get a beer and that will fill my stomach. So I order one. The woman brings it to me and I notice she's got a gigantic bag of laundry. I think I’ll just help her fold it. I start folding and there’s 5 pairs of tiny pants the same size, and suddenly in my vision I see she has quintuplets she’s looking after and trying to make money in the bar. This is just part of life. The customers sitting at the bar all know her. I fold the clothes and put them back in the garbage bag behind the counter where I found them. Then I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

317,1322,,06/03/2020,03/06/2020 00:03,"“The Concert” The setting of this dream is the house I used to live in in Toronto. It starts and I’m in the kitchen with many other people. I had three roommates in this house, sometimes 4. It was close to UFT. Most of us were students, though some were not. I don’t know everybody in the kitchen this particular day, though I do know some of them. Everything in this dream is long and slow motion and drawn out and stretched in terms of the background. It’s not that people are moving in slow motion, but the minutes between things are elongated and stretched. I woke up feeling really heavy and groggy. In the kitchen, someone is making toast and the toaster is way across the kitchen. While the toast is in the toaster and I’m waiting for my turn, there’s at least 7 people that come in and out of the kitchen and have conversations, then leave the kitchen again, and the toast is still in the toaster. It’s not burnt, though. I can see the elements are still on, but it’s taking ages to toast yet the relationships among people are moving at a normal speed. I don’t question this in the dream - it’s not until I wake up that I notice everything in the dream is taking longer. In the kitchen, I’m oblivious of this distortion of time. I do, however, have these conversations with people. When I realize I’m not going to have toast that day, I leave the kitchen and go upstairs to my room. I go through the drawers in my room, looking to see what's there because a concert is happening tonight and Omar is meeting me at my house along with a couple of other friends. I start to prepare and I’m deciding what to wear. In one of the drawers, I find a bunch of checks. I look at it and wonder where these came from. When I start to look through it, I realize these are checks that a whole bunch of people have given me. They are of various amounts for an endeavor I’m supposed to be taking. They have invested in me. I realize I haven’t put them in the bank and they aren’t very safe where they are rolled up and put in this ceramic vase. So it sparks my memories. I put them back in the vase. It’s too late to go to the bank tonight, but I will go tomorrow. Then I go back downstairs. Omar and his friend Al and a girl he’s taking with him have arrived and they’re in the living room. We are happy to see each other. I go down and am talking to them for a while. I see what he’s wearing and tell him I’m going to get changed. I go back upstairs and someone is in the shower. I find a rolled up wad of money on the floor. I turn around and Omar is behind me. I say, “Is this yours?” He says, “No. Oh, there’s so many people in this house and we don’t know all of them. Don’t go downstairs and just say, ‘whose wad of money is this?’” I say, “I won’t. I’m going to go put it in my room and I’ll find a way to make it known to someone so they know their money is missing.” I go back into my room and I change. I pick out a black mini skirt with gold thread around the hem. I think it’s very pretty and sparkly. I choose a white blouse and a jacket that goes overtop just a few inches above the hem of the skirt. I put on my black tights and a pair of bulky socks and boots that look really nice. Then I go downstairs and Omar tells me I look very nice. But I turn and Al’s friend (I don’t know her name) is wearing the same thing I am. I think, “Well that’s really odd. That wasn’t what she was wearing when I went up the stairs.” I look over at Omar and he’s laughing. I shrug it off and I say to everyone in the room, “How much money is everyone bringing?” So I’m trying to get them to look in their wallets. The person whose money it is that’s missing will realize it’s lost and I can return the money to whoever it is. But they all check their wallets and they say different amounts. I say, “Okay, well I’m going to go upstairs and get my money.” While I’m going upstairs, the person is still in the shower and I realize it’s my nephew, Jared. I wonder if the money belongs to him. I put the wad of money in the same ceramic vase as the other checks that I need to deposit in the bank. Then I look through my own drawers and I find my wallet. I take out 2 twenties and put them in the little clutch that I’ve decided to take with me for the night. I go back downstairs again. Someone else is in the living room and she’s showing Omar this fabric and saying, “Isn’t this beautiful? It would make a nice skirt.” I look and say, “Oh yes, it is.” This is all gold and if you look closely, the gold thread has created patterns of flowers and it’s shimmering. This gold is really quite beautiful. Then suddenly, it’s not fabric anymore. It is a skirt - a longer skirt. She says, “This skirt costs $2,000 and people pay that for it and only wear it once. Within a couple of weeks it’s in a punk rock thrift store and that’s where I found it. This would look really nice on you.” I say, “Wow, you’re giving it to me?!” She says, “Yes.” I say, “Thank you so much!” I was thinking maybe I’ll change into it for tonight and then decide not to because it’s a long skirt and I want to save it for another time. I ask her if she would like some money for it. She hesitates and doesn’t answer and I’m thinking I could give her another twenty. I’m waiting and waiting, but she doesn’t answer me, so I thank her graciously. I go back upstairs and I put it in my room. I look into my wallet and I get out another $20 just in case to give to her. So I go back downstairs and by this time, I’m becoming conscious that it feels like it's the same time and all these activities are happening and we still haven’t left for the concert. So I say to everyone, “Shouldn’t we be leaving?” They say, “Yes, it starts really soon.” I look out the door and I see that someone else is coming in and they need to get ready for the concert. Right at that time, there’s a sliver in the time-space continuum and I’m at work. I’m thinking, “I need to get back to meet everyone for the concert.” Then when I'm thinking that, that same time frame fabric opens up and I’m back in the house. I think, “Oh good, everyone is still here.” But then we’re waiting for someone else to get ready. She comes back downstairs and she’s wearing that shimmering gold skirt. I think, “Wow, this is really odd.” But again I just shrug it off and I’m trying to get everyone to go. I say, “We should call for a cab.” But Omar’s friend is driving. I tell them there isn’t enough room for everyone in the one car. Then suddenly they have other rides and we get in the car and go. We arrive at the concert hall and I’m surprised that it’s general admission. We find a place to stand on the floor. I feel like I’m in the masonic temple or the music hall. I decide it’s the music hall. It’s quite dark. The band is playing but there’s no lights on the stage or upstairs on the balcony. But I recognize the structure and I think, “Oh I know where we are.” Then we start dancing as though the concert is just a background. It’s good. Omar and I are dancing and enjoying ourselves. That’s when I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

320,1901,,07/03/2020,03/07/2020 00:02,"I was homeless and wandering around the town where I stayed. I found a building called a ""power station"" in a small partially fenced off complex. These buildings were used to power the city and contained generators. The outside of the building was green with a fairly low ceiling and maybe some kind of sheet metal roof of brown. For some reason the doors were unlocked to power stations and while one wasn't supposed to go inside, there were no specific restrictions against doing so. I opened the door and entered.  Inside there were two giant cylindrical capacitor-like generators which were connected with cables. There were three cables, two of which were plugged, one to each generator. The ones plugged in were red and black, with a blue one on the right. I remembered in the dream that as a kid, my brother and I had found such a power house on a trip to California and had explored it together. (In reality, we never did see such a thing.) I went over to the blue cable and dragged back behind the generator to where I knew I could plug it in. I don't remember what this would have accomplished but it was either to increase the power, maybe in some magical way, or to shut down the generators completely. There was a hint of something spiritual to making the connection between cable and generator. I failed to make it connect and worried that I would get in trouble I left.  I walked a ways away across a grassy field and over a small ridge where I set up my bivy hopefully out of sight. My mom, who was a police officer then came up to investigate who had been in the power station. I was thinking that they wouldn't be able to see me over the ridge, but I was wrong. She came to me, arrested me, and locked me up inside of the power station until she could have higher authorities come to take me away. However, I had a plan. When she was taking my finger prints outside of the power station, I used a magical spell which turned my finger prints into those of animals and I used a false name on the forms. Because the stations had no cameras, I knew that this would make it impossible for them to prove that it had been me.   My mom was my mom but she was also completely impersonal and businesslike. Once I was locked into the power station and my mom left, I looked for a way to escape. The location of the power station changed, for underneath me was a mesh grating through which I could see a river and branches below and further a long the ocean. I was able to move the grate, jump down onto a branch, and make my way into the river. I returned home eventually and found my brother. It was night time and I was at his window. We were in a large apartment complex high up and were communicating secretly to one of his friends through the window. We may have been trying to get his friend to join us.

I blew on one and it instantly dissipated in an explosion of mist. We ran about the valley and banished the clouds either by waving a hand through them or blowing on them.

325,1323,,08/03/2020,03/08/2020 00:01,"“The Two Sisters” The setting for this dream is my grandparents' house on the north shore of Lake Ontario. The house is really spacious - it’s very large like a sprawling ranch style house with a deep full basement that you wouldn’t even know was there until you went into it. There were so many rooms. I used to get lost in there as a child. I think that’s significant. Both levels open out onto the shore of Lake Ontario. In the bottom level, there’s been a lot of excavation. The big patio doors open out into a lower area of land and you can walk straight from there down to the shore where there was a boathouse. It’s also concealed until you get right there. It’s dug out into the shore. The upper level does the same thing - it has a greenhouse on the side of it and you walk out that door onto the upper level which is a garden. There's plenty of natural light and it feels spacious. Everything is wider and deeper and taller when you’re in there. In the dream, those details remain consistent with how the house was in real life. I’m in that house and I’m walking down the long upstairs hallway into the kitchen. I see someone I know. I realize that she’s also living in this house and I didn’t realize she was there. We don’t speak at first. She’s just going about her own thing making some food for herself in the large kitchen. I leave the kitchen and walk outside through the greenhouse. I’m sitting in the garden and gazing out on the expanse of water and it’s just so spacious. It feels really good. I’m just resting. I’m hearing the sounds of bees. I’m hearing the pollinators as they move from the flowers. My body feels the buzz of life. I stay there for some unknown period of time and then I go back into the house. No one is in the kitchen this time. I walk through the kitchen into a den, a sitting room. The den has two doors - one from the kitchen and one into the hallway. So I walk through it and it’s an interesting shape. It has eight sides. I’ve always wondered at the positioning of it. It feels like a pivotal point. I leave it and I walk into the hallway and the roommate or sister that had previously been in the kitchen is coming towards me. We meet in the hallway and she says to me, “I have something to show you.” So I’m engaged in a conversation with her and I don’t remember what it is. She says, “Just a minute, I have to go get something else from my room.” She walks back to her room which is in the basement, so it’s on the lower level. I follow her a little ways behind. We go down the stairs and I notice that she goes into a room that I previously noticed had a lot of stuff in it. Although I don’t say this out loud, I’m thinking, “Wow that’s a lot of stuff. How does she move in that room?” She goes into the room then comes back out and says to me, as though she heard my thoughts: “Yeah I’m unpacking everything and re-sorting this all out,” as though this is a reason for why there’s so much stuff out all over the place. She says, “But I’ve cleared this spot.” And without leaving where we’re talking, I see inside her room - I’m not in it. It’s a square and has stuff everywhere covering every surface of the floor. But there’s this one spot about 4 feet into the room. It’s a 4 feet long by 2 feet wide clear spot. She says, “But I’m able to navigate through this clear spot I’ve made.” Then my consciousness zooms into the future and sees that she’s navigated this clear spot. While she was in the process of taking everything out and sorting through it - because she was able to navigate through this clear spot - she’s become quite comfortable in it. It’s kind of like she’s let go of the original intent for taking everything out like that now she’s comfortable with the clear spot she’s made. She says to me, “I still intend to finish this, though. I’m okay with this spot I’ve just made. But I will finish it someday in my own way.” I’ve forgotten what happens next, but we’re back upstairs together and she’s asking me if I want to do something with her. Then another sister comes out and I realize she’s living here, too, but she hadn’t been home. She moves really quickly. I realize there’s some tension between them. The other sister is really frustrated with the first sister because she’s not moving quickly and she feels that she will be left behind by the first sister. I feel the tension between them, but do not know what to do. I feel torn about doing the something with the first sister while the other sister is still upset at how slowly she’s moving.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

327,1117,,09/03/2020,03/09/2020 00:01,"Just a few snippets of dream: one is an outside battle of sorts happening. There’s some forces that are trying to wipe me and my companions out. I’m not even totally clear who my companions are. I just know I’m responsible as I’m part of the team trying to keep humanity in general safe - it’s a general feeling of protecting, but I’m not sure who I’m protecting. It’s not anyone in particular, it’s just a group of people, some of whom are my friends and some I don’t know. It is totally a preparation for some sort of standoff or battle because me and the other friends or colleagues are planning and prepping and come up with a battle plan. It totally reminds me of a movie. I don’t even know what's coming for us, I’m not sure, other than that I know that me and some of the others have superpowers and we’re making our plans around the powers we have. One of the people on my side is projecting out this gel that freezes anything that’s coming towards us. So whatever it is that’s coming to attack us starts to attack - they have a green aura around them. This person puts out their gel and it does freeze some of the enemy but doesn’t last. As the battle continues, it’s a full on attack and we have to fall back because we end up not being able to hold our position. It was very dramatic and I can’t even remember if it was missiles being launched at us or what was coming, but it was a life or death situation. Then some other parts of the dream happen. The only thing I can remember of this second part is another group of people and a man who I don’t know and his friend who I also don’t know. The first group I’m watching go into an old fashioned horse and carriage. They load into it from a barn type area and they’re getting a tour of a ranch. I’m not sure what the business is, but they load into this carriage and they go down on the tour. Part of the tour takes them to the entrance to the ranch where there is a big sign that announces the name of it. But this entrance place also has an herb garden where they’re allowed to gather some herbs as souvenirs. I am down there with them. There’s chives or green onions that we’re growing but they’ve dried somehow. So you can pick them up and take the dried chives with you. There’s also lemongrass and a bunch of herbs and people are able to gather them. I’m gathering them and working the ranch - that’s my role. I’m part of the tour but I also have work to do on this ranch to keep it going. The man is the owner of the ranch and there are a ton of other people who work on the ranch with separate roles. There’s a bookkeeper and all these other people that I don’t know who have roles and do a lot of planning for the tours or parties that come through, they do this man’s finances and just sort of run things for him. I’m mostly a little worker bee out on the land. So this group of people comes and goes and I'm getting the feeling this is a regular stop on a tour. Then the scene shifts a little bit from daytime to evening. The man is in the carriage thing and he asks me to go for a ride with him. His friend is driving the carriage. I get in and we head down the driveway like we’re going to leave the ranch. There's a place where the road turns and on the right hand side there’s a huge mud pit. You can see old tire tracks in it, but I’m really concerned because if the carriage falls into this mud pit, it is never coming out. I’m watching the friend struggle a little bit. He’s really close to the edge and I’m concerned. He has all my attention even though this other man who I’m sitting in the carriage with doesn’t seem to be concerned at all. He’s keeping a conversation going with me and I have one mind on the conversation with him and one mind on the fact that this carriage could get really stuck and fall off into the gigantic mud pit. I finally say something to this man and he says not to worry. At this point, the carriage turns itself around so I can see the entrance of the ranch with this big sign. It dawns on me that the whole reason for the driver to have been going so close to the mud pit was a distraction technique so that I wouldn’t turn behind me and see what they were doing to the sign on the ranch. When the driver finally does turn the carriage around, I see the sign on the ranch and it’s a marriage proposal from this man in the carriage. I’m so confused because this man is essentially my boss all the time and we don’t have any relationship that I know of and all the people that work for him have been changing out this sign and preparing this whole thing. I’m a little bit speechless and really confused and thinking that there’s another person this man would rather be with. I remember sort of sitting in the carriage going: “Well let’s try some things out and see how we work together.”",Rose,last_nights_dream
328,1324,,09/03/2020,03/09/2020 00:02,"“The Toddler” In this dream, I am on a beach at a resort. I am somehow inserted with this family and the son is one of my friends in real life . He’s on the periphery of the dream - he comes in with the family and does some stuff, then leaves and does his own thing. I don’t seem to be as mobile. There’s two sisters and one brother. The one sister has three children and her partner. The other sister does not have any; she doesn’t have a partner either. I don’t really have anything to do with any of them. In the dream, I am in this enclosure. It’s kind of open like a yurt situated on the beach. I seem to be involved with the careeving of the kids. One boy is 7 and my friend does a lot of things with this 7 year old kid. In the dream, I notice that he’s a gym teacher. He takes his 7 year old nephew with him to class a lot, so they share a lot of quality time together. They share a love of movement and athletic sports. At one point, I realize that my friend is actually wearing the 7 year old’s clothes. He takes his shirt off at one point and the hat. I’m looking at them on the counter and I don't want to directly ask him if he’s wearing the 7 year old’s clothes, so I look at the tags on the hat and the clothes and I say, “These say size 7. I’m surprised that they fit you.” And he says, “Yes, it’s possible that they may be my nephew’s clothing.” At that point I realize we’re in a change room. I’m also changing and every time I take off my shorts, there’s another pair of shorts underneath them. I keep trying to take them off because I’m trying to change and it just keeps going on and on, like 10-20 times where I keep taking them off and there’s another pair of shorts underneath them. In the dream, this frustrates me. I give up trying to change and I go back from that one area of the yurt where people change to the common area where people are sitting and eating. The dad asks me if I would sit with the youngest child of the three for a few minutes, so I do. The child tells me that his name is Mason and he’s not two years old yet, he’s barely over 1, probably about 14 months old. He starts talking to me and telling me what he wants to eat and how to make it. I’m listening to him and he has the voice of an old man - not a voice that sounds like an old man, but what he’s saying is in a mature voice of a person much older than he is. I’m wondering if anyone else realizes this. The dad comes and sits down beside me for a moment. Without asking the question, I just look at him and he tells me that his son has some abilities we don’t fully know about yet. I think that must explain the deep observations this very young child is talking to. Plus I realize that any words at all at 14 months is advanced. I feel this child has a mystical quality to him. l check out for the rest of the dream, whatever activities I had been involved in, I decide to hang out with this baby and just listen to this baby and the observations he’s making because the soul that is in his body is someone he’s channeling that is very wise. I do this for some time and I feel like I’ve been shared with. The rest of the dream takes on some kind of mystical quality. I see the other sister that doesn’t have any children on the beach. She’s wearing clothes that will attract attention to her body. She’s very beautiful. I see her wrapped up in the need to be admired and not so much connecting to the people around her. The dream deconstructs and I’m in a house I lived in when I was teaching college. I lived there with a roommate on Simcoe Street in a city that starts with O. My ex-husband is in there, as well. He is spending an inordinate amount of money on something and I realize I’ve been paying for it without consciously being aware of it. I ask him if we can talk about this. He keeps saying later. I realize in the dream that I either have to keep paying for his lack of conscious awareness or if I stop paying for it, he will just disappear.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream
329,1899,,09/03/2020,03/09/2020 00:03,"I was at a bowling alley with some friends, my mom, and Bernard from my church's small group. The bowling ally looked very much like a casino though, and each bowling machine where you setup your information was a slot machine. My mom was bowling really well and I watched as she got a ridiculous split and then a strike--all of which she bowled in slow motion. I was having difficulty setting up my position for my turn to bowl and by the time that I was ready, the machine had already knocked down my pins. I had to walk over to the machine and fiddle around with the settings in an attempt to make it reset the pins.  As I was doing this, Bernard walked out to the far side of the bowling alley and took apart one of the machines to see if he could fix the problem. When he had looked inside, he found out that the bowling alley (or casino at this point) had not installed all of the government-mandated protocols making it likely that someone could hack the systems and turn the tables in their favor. He began to explain that they didn't have several security layers that they should have, including something called a ""crypto ring"".

I thought that this was odd, so I followed him into the closet and found that there was a hidden door at the back of his closet which was an alternate path to the bathroom.  I entered the hallway and to my surprise found that there were several rooms branching off from it--rooms which I had not even known existed. I wasn't entirely surprised as I had always felt that the house's dimensions were large than made sense based on the number of rooms it had.  I entered one room and found a mostly open space with furniture only on the sides. Everything was wooden and the ceilings were high. The room was roughly square and maybe about 25 feet in each dimension. It was dim and felt unused or only used for storage. The other room was more like a living area with couches and coffee table and dominated by the color green. It felt as if someone had lived there.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

There’s also another part of the party - a child, a younger person, but I’m not entirely sure who it is. We’re headed out into what looks like a rather desolate lava field. But before we go, I am with a gypsy woman. I have met with this gypsy woman and we are in her caravan. It’s a cross between an old fashioned caravan drawn by a pair of horses but also an RV. It’s awesome. On the inside, it’s set up the way an RV is set up - you can see through the front windows where the driver’s seat is, but it’s still very witchy on the inside. This gypsy woman travels around but doesn’t necessarily look like a regular gypsy with scarves and whatnot. She is dressed in long robes and has longer hair. She has jewelry and there’s something about the jewelry - it’s earrings. I’m on a quest, but there’s two, so the first one I go on, I have a particular pair of earrings I pick out from her and I wear them. They’re a talisman of some sort. They are either protective or hold magic powers that enhance my own. I’m not entirely sure. I wear these out on this quest and I go out. I don’t remember the details of it, but I come back into the van. It’s time for me to continue on the quest, but it’s a level up now. I’ve realized this time around that the earrings are really important and I need a good pair for what I’m going to do. I’m going through what she has and there’s this pair that is just stunning. One earring is pearls with long chains and other gems on the bottom. The other earring that’s part of this pair is a huge chandelier earring which reaches past my breast. It’s really long. I put them both on and I can feel myself all of a sudden level up, like you would in a video game. She is trying to tell me what the different properties of these earrings are based on the different stones and what’s in them and what they will allow me to do. So my dad or whoever it - the male figure - is in the background, he’s still with me. He just is kind of there - he was just kind of there on the first quest and he’s just kind of there on the second quest. He does make a few suggestions about how to go about doing things, but he’s definitely taking a backseat. This is all up to me. The gypsy woman and I are conversing about the powers of the earrings, but also my own magical powers that will help me out during this section part of the quest. Then the scene changes from this questing to me being in what seems like a village. It kind of reminds me of the villages you visit in Disneyland. They’re a little bit fake but they’re kind of neat because there’s cool stuff in them. This village is smallish and there is an appearance of all my high school classmates and other people I don't know who are just filling in the spaces. I’m watching as one of my high school friends - someone who’s in an older class is building a structure out of logs. It’s an art piece in the center of the town. The rest of us are coming to gather around. There’s lots of coming and going and I see him build this. I leave and I go do something else. The structure is up and I see people come and have little meetings around this structure. I’m in a pool and it’s an indoor pool entirely enclosed in glass. It’s gorgeous. I’m there watching people come and go. There’s meetings happening. My mom has shown up and I hear her having a meeting with some of my classmates. This is very interesting because one of my classmates is having a tantrum and he’s screaming and crying just like a little kid would. I can't even see him, but I know who it is by his voice. But I don’t know what my mom is saying and I don’t know what the meeting is about. In some way she is this boss or it feels like she’s some sort of crime lord and my classmates are coming and going and doing her bidding, essentially. I’m shocked to hear my classmate screaming and crying because it seems like such childish behavior. But my mom is not phased by it at all. I can’t actually see any of this. I can only hear it and feel what’s going on. I do not have vision of what this is - they are not in my eyesight. I’m still in this pool/atrium place and their meeting is somewhere above me - like there’s rooms upstairs above me. I’ve stepped out of the atrium and it’s towards my back. Another classmate has her coffee in hand. It looks like she’s just woken up and she's in her pajamas. She stomps towards that art piece that the other classmate had made and she just pulls the logs down, yelling. I don’t even know what she’s yelling about, but she’s making the assumption that one of our classmates had made the artpiece. When we tell her that it was actually an upperclassman, she gets a little bit freaked out, but it’s too late. She can’t fix the sculpture. It’s already been pulled down. Throughout this whole time, I am part of this scene - I am part of the village, I am part of what's going on, but I’m also not.

I do not know why they let me stay at there house, but they were planning on leaving to go on a vacation or something medical related as they were doctors. I had to leave as I couldn't stay in the house by myself.   I met up with Doug and we began to plan a real-life D&D campaign. We decided that we'd amass an army in the desert and would build an underground Colosseum. It would be circular with tall pillars and three stories, two of which would be underground. The plan was to have a completely defensible base underground where we could retreat if necessary. Each story was probably 30 or 40 feet high and the total base was several hundred feet across.   We had an entire ensemble of army and workers or slaves helping us to build the base. All of this felt like something that would come out of the Old Testament or stories about the building of the pyramids. And all of this was being done so that we could start a D&D campaign.  As the dream progressed, I found myself with my dad driving in a red dodge dart from the 60s. It was actually called something slightly different in the dream, but was basically a dart. He was driving down the suicide lane of a busy road and cars kept swerving in and out in front of him barely missing us. I was sure that we would get in a wreck, but we managed to avoid any collisions.  The dream transitioned into one where there was this giant silver and red transformer-like mech man. He easily 30 feet tall and could transform into a vehicle. He wanted to race against me, and I was now a professional driver and had my dad's dodge dart. I wasn't too keen on racing him as I knew that while I could win, he would kill me if he won. I had to race him, and began to drive up a long spiraling track in a cylindrical structure. I'm not sure who was winning, but when we got to the end, he decided to attack.  At this point, I found myself fighting the evil monster with the entire cast of Critical Role with the fight being narrated by Matt Mercer. The mech bit off the head of an old man and he was too far gone for us to save. The fight continued...",Bob,last_nights_dream2

We got together at a spiritual retreat, and when we met he was being haunted by the ghost of his past ex-girlfriend. I was a full blown, magical-practicing Priestess and I sent his ghost-ex-girlfriend back into the Spirit Realm. After his release from his ghost, he was totally devoted to me, his lover, his friend, his queen, his priestess. It was pure magic. This dream was definitely in a time past... the time of the Vikings expansion and invasion of the new and old worlds.

344,1120,,13/03/2020,03/13/2020 00:02,"I’m with a group of friends. There's a lot of my high school classmates here. It’s my birthday celebration. It feels like nighttime and we’re on our way to the place. We’re driving down the road and it’s a road that’s familiar to me - it looks like a place in Hilo where I grew up. We’re driving down the road and it’s all lush and green and gorgeous. The ocean is right there. We’re driving over a bridge and the ocean is under us because there’s a ravine under us. We’re headed to a cave where we’re going to do my birthday celebration. The cave is really big and it’s like - it’s not dark in the cave. The rock instead of being black lava looks like white sandstone and is reflective. We have all of our gear. I was very specific about this birthday celebration. I wanted a very specific type of cake with a very specific type of frosting and goodies on top. Then I asked for flowers. I was very specific about the colors of the flowers - purple roses and pink carnations and some yellow calla lilies. All of my classmates are carrying all of the supplies. I’m leading the way. As we're entering this cave, there’s water that’s swirling around the rocks. It’s so fun because we’re jumping from rock to rock and we have to jump over these expanses of water. But I am so light I can feel that I’m floating and we’re all floating a little bit. Each jump is a super graceful and playful leap. No one is falling or sliding into the water. We’re all just very gracefully but very playfully jumping from rock to rock until we get towards the back of the cave where it’s smooth and flat. It’s still light in a sense, it’s not full daylight. We can still see. It’s luminescent. There's this flat area in the back where we’re all hanging out. The cake gets served and the flowers get put up. It’s totally messy but fun. The cake is just being handed out with no plates. People are just grabbing handfuls. I am allergic to cake so I'm only eating the frosting off the top and the bonbons or some sort of candies embedded in the frosting. I’ve had maybe three pieces but am starting to feel sick so I just leave it. We go a little further back into the cave. Everyone is dancing and having a really good time. There's a lot of playing. Then the flowers are all over the floor in the back - it’s like they’ve been spread out so they can be seen and looked at and danced through. So again, it’s very particular, it’s something I asked for. Then it’s time to go and cleanup needs to happen. So I’m watching as all of my friends are now cleaning up the cake that’s everywhere and the flowers - they’re gathering them. It’s very interesting because there is a canal of water between the smooth flat area at the back of the cave and the rocks that we were jumping over. The canal separates them. In the section where we were jumping over the rocks. There’s now a table. There’s an older Indian woman sitting at the table. We keep giving parts of the cake to her and she’s sorting them somehow. My classmates are also picking up the flowers and they’re sorting them on this table. The backdrop behind this table is a waterfall, so at some point we went into a waterfall to come into the cave. All of it is very deliberate in the way this Indian woman is sorting the cake and my classmates are sorting the flowers into the purple roses and pink carnations and yellow calla lilies. As we’re going back towards the entrance of the cave, we’re carrying bags of trash because we’ve cleaned up after ourselves. We keep trying not to step in the water but this time we’re having a harder time and we end up in the water and all wet. At some point we give up trying to stay dry and we just end up in the water. But there's a vague nagging feeling that we didn’t really want to be in the water because it's going to make us dirty or something like that. Then the dream ends.",Rose,last_nights_dream

For some reason, we had decided that it was time to kill and eat Lopsy and we were debating the best way to kill the rabbit. Strangely I wasn't really opposed to this didn't seem to have much emotional feeling toward the killing. However, because she was my rabbit, I decided that I would be the one to kill her. It felt like an Old Testament sacrifice.  We discussed bopping her on the head with a big stick, strangling, and possibly stabbing. I asked my dad if he thought it might be best if I broke her neck. I took hold of Lopsy and firmly grasped her head in one hand and shoulders in the others. I asked my dad if I pulled to one side as strongly and quickly as I could if that would do the trick. He thought it was a strong possibility so I went for it. I think something cracked, but she wasn't immediately dead. She lay on the ground with her neck broken, head to the side at a terrible angle, and twitching.   Even at this point, I wasn't at all sad. It was more unfortunate than anything else and we wondered if she was already dead and just twitching as animals will after they have been killed.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

My husband has engaged the services of a male escort. He’s really looking forward to this man because he’s a very good kisser. But the man’s body is so distorted - he’s overweight, his face is pock marked with red oozing blisters, his eyes are drooping. He decides to bring his boyfriend who is short and stocky. I’m not happy about the situation but there’s nothing I can do about it. Later in the night, my husband returns from a hotel room. He’s really disappointed because the guy and his boyfriend just fucked each other the whole time and he was like okay, where am I in this whole situation? I asked him if he got off and he said yes. Then we’re still in this hotel and people are looking at each other with a lot of fear and distrust, moving rooms and packing bags and trying to decide where to go. Now I’m sitting in a hotel room all by myself and preparing to get on an online Zoom call ritual with some sisters. In order to prepare, I first spray the area around me in all directions with a chamomile-based spray. The next procedure in order to sign onto the call is to spray Lysol in every direction, so I do that. Then the scene shifts again. I am at another hotel - it’s a boutique hotel. There is a sinister plot going on - the servants are planning to kill their masters. There are hidden guns and hidden agendas. I can’t recall much more. Then we’re all downstairs at community dinner. More people arrive and a couple are wearing N95 masks over their faces. One of them comes up and stands right behind me and takes off his mask. He wants to introduce me and the little girl sitting in my lap to a friend of his. The little girl is his granddaughter.

There is shallow water with rocks like tidepools. I look down into the water and see two black and white cats curled together in a circle. They are all wet. I think it’s odd that the cats are so pleasantly sleeping floating on the water. I keep walking and see a couple drenched yellow chicks. I wonder if they’ve drowned or if they’re also sleeping.

351,1325,,15/03/2020,03/15/2020 00:02,"This dream starts in a house where I am getting ready to go on a journey. The journey begins at a certain time for me. But as I’m starting to pack, I realize my daughter is also coming with me. There’s other people in the house besides my daughter. They seem to be part of the background, like white noise, although occasionally one will come up and make some kind of remark or offer some bit of direction or advice. I’m packing bags. There’s a reason, although I don’t know what, that my daughter has to leave 10 minutes before I do and I’m going to meet her there. I pack both of our bags separately and I make two different lunches - one for her, one for me. As I go to leave out the apartment door, one of the people that lives there, comes up. Although she does not look like my step-mother, she carries the energy of her and the dynamic between us is the same. She questions me and says, “Are you sure you should be doing that?” I tell her, “It’s fine, I have to do this anyway.” Then I close the door. Although I do not see how I get to the train station, we suddenly shift from my apartment to the train station. I am standing there to purchase her train ticket and the conductor or ticket seller says to me: “How old is that child?” I look down in puzzlement and see that she’s only five. I think, “How did that happen? My daughter is much older than that.” I see her as older but having a 5-year old body. I think, “Well, I can’t send a 5-year-old by themselves on this 3-hour train ride to a different country. It’s not safe.” So, I tell him I’ve changed my mind. Then I’m uncertain what to do. Now I’m in a dilemma. I sit outside the train station for a moment with her. I start talking to her and describing the country we’re about to go to. I tell her that it’s Rome and describe the kind of life we would have there. She’s enjoying the story. But now I have to figure out how I’m going to get us there at the same time. In that moment, the dream shifts. I'm not at the train station anymore. My daughter and I are at this old beautiful house. It’s one of the houses that a governor general would have been given to build when they first came over from Britain or France to what would have been Upper or Lower Canada. We enter this house and are greeted by a butler who indicates where we are to put our shoes and socks. The house has extremely high ceilings and an extraordinary amount of washrooms. So as we walk down the main hallway, there’s one washroom to the left - it’s like a powder room. Across the wide hallway is a bathroom with a bathtub, bidet, marbled sink and scale and lots of white fluffy Egyptain cotton towels. The door is open, that's how I can see this. We continue down the main hallway to a gathering room, like a lounge area. There’s many people there. One of them is a person I know. The other people I recognize as people affiliated with the house - the family that owns the house and people that work for that family. We take a seat on one of the couches. More people keep coming in during this period of time when we’re waiting. We end up being a little bit squished - where you can feel the arm of the person sitting beside you on these couches. I’m able to hear the one person I know - he’s an author - that he’s actually voice-to-text recording an idea for a story as he’s sitting here waiting for the gathering. So we’re sitting in this sitting room, waiting, and I’m listening to the author voice-to-app recording some kind of idea. I’m getting the feeling that there’s some kind of clandestine activity going on. The people that have filed in and don’t have anywhere to sit and are standing close to me - there’s two of them - they’re also talking in hushed tones. I’m starting to sink into my body a little and extend my hearing out, so I'm focusing in on these individual conversations that people are having. In the dream, I am still aware of the purpose that I’ve come to this house for and it’s tied to me being able to leave at the same time from the train station with my daughter. I also start to realize that what the man is recording isn’t just an idea for a book, it’s a plan for also getting out of this country and into another one. I start listening to it more. Then he realizes I am listening and says, “Do you recognize that?” I said yes. He says, “After this is over, meet me in the bathroom - the main bathroom in the main hallway.” So I agree. Then someone comes in that’s a representative from this family. I start to notice that all of the family - they have pale whitish gold skin and bright red hair. As I look at the man beside me, I notice that he’s got some kind of similarity of features and coloring even though his hair is a lot darker, it has some threads of red-gold in it. I wonder if he’s a member of the family and disgruntled somehow with how they normally do things and that’s why he’s planning this way to get out that’s in opposition to what the family is telling us. Then in the dream, I have this flashback memory of being on a ski hill a long time ago and seeing them all together and that’s where I also know him from. Then in the room, the representative of the family is telling us this stuff. I’m not really listening. I’m starting to watch the people who are circulating around the room and gathering together - like who’s sitting with who and stuff. I see one person go up the stairs into the upstairs bathroom that’s at the top of the stairs. About two minutes later, I see the person they were talking to also go up the stairs into that bathroom. I’m thinking, “What are they up to?” So I walk up the stairs. Just as I arrive at the top, the one person exits. The door is open and the other person is standing there. I look in and the bathroom is hideous. It’s got toilet paper strewn all over the place and it looks like it hasn’t been cleaned in ages. The toilet itself is like a portapotty, only about six inches off the ground and the seat looks like it was made for a toddler, yet it looks like adults have been urinating into it, so there’s urine all over the seat and it’s just hideous. In fact, it does look like the last person stood on it and squatted and that’s why there’s urine all over it. There’s no conversation going on. I turn around and go back down the stairs. I realize that the meeting conversation is over and people are starting to disassemble. I go through the sitting room. Now I have my daughter in hand, she’s still five and as I’m leaving, I look to the side and I see the man that I’ve been talking to and he’s in the main bathroom where he asked to meet. But the door is open a crack and he has a towel wrapped around his waist, his hair is wet and he’s drying it with another towel. He’s just had a shower. So he’s involved in what he’s doing. There’s no meeting going on. He appears not to recognize me. That was just all at a glance. So I just keep walking out the front door with my daughter. I walk out the front door and we are back at the train station again. I’ve got these two lunches in my hand still and our suitcases. The train rolls up. We both get on it. We sit in one of the compartments and open up our lunches. I describe to her what I’ve made for her. We start eating. The train starts moving. And that’s where I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

353,1121,,16/03/2020,03/16/2020 00:01,"It’s my birthday or some celebration. I’m being celebrated and I’m with some friends. One is my sister-in-law. There’s a whole celebration planned for me. Dinner is going to happen later. But first, there is shopping for swimsuits. It’s curious because I actually found a swimsuit that I like - at least I like the colors and the cut of it. But the top is a little bit funny. So we’re going to a shop to look for other swimsuits. This shop is gorgeous - it’s totally open and I can see the ocean and palm trees in the background. I can hear the wind rustling through the palm trees. It feels tropical or at least it’s warm. I go into this shop and there’s big windows. It looks a little like a plantation, so it’s a bit old-fashioned, but updated. The floors are wood and there’s chandeliers for lights. The shopkeeper is a woman who looks familiar to me, but I don't think I know her. It’s me and my sister-in-law and another old friend from high school, Connie, who almost never shows up in my dreams, so it’s interesting that she’s there. We’re going through the swimsuits and they are gorgeous. They’re sort of a cross between swimsuits and lingerie because the bottoms don’t cover a whole lot adn the tops are see-through in parts. They have rhinestones and they’re made of lace or a mesh netting. Some are regular swimsuit materials. They are all in different colors - black ones with sequin embroidery, blue ones with gemstones on the front. I want to try all of them on even though I already have this swimsuit on. This swimsuit I have on is cute - a salmony pink color with orange and teal and mint green accents. It looks good, except that the triangle top has layers of ruffles. I hear myself say, “I don't like this top because it makes my tits look huge.” So I’m trying on these other swimsuits, but while the bottoms all fit, none of the tops fit me - they’re all too small and they don’t fit over my back. My back is too big and I’m having a hard time pulling the tops over or getting them to stay on. It’s making me sad because some of these are really gorgeous and my sister-in-law and my friend Connie are trying them on. They look great on them. We keep picking out the same swimsuits to try on. This takes a while. It’s almost like when you go try on wedding dresses and they serve you champagne. I’m not drinking anything because I don’t like to drink, but my friends are having some and there’s chocolate. It’s quite the experience. This whole time I am aware that even though we’re trying on these swimsuits, it’s time and then past time for me to go to this dinner that’s been arranged. We’re all late for the dinner. Eventually I just say, I’m good with the swimsuit I have. The two girls buy their own. The woman who's doing the shopkeeping is quite gracious. She’s an older lady in heels and a pencil skirt. We’ve kept her past her closing time, but she’s still gracious. Then we go to dinner and dinner, indeed, has started. It’s a long, long banquet table. As we walk up to it, I can see that it’s long and there’s a lot of people. I’m not entirely sure who all is sitting at the table, but I know them. They are definitely ready to celebrate me, so I’m walking up to the table and am feeling a little overwhelmed like there’s a lot of pressure and I’m late. Everyone is eating and I take a moment and order my first appetizer. I haven’t even sat at the table. I stand up and order it from the server that comes. Then at some point I’ve been crying or something has happened because all of the makeup on my face has been wiped off. So instead of sitting at the table, I walk around the side of this building that my dinner is being served at. It’s interesting because this long long table is out on a lanai. I can hear the wind through the palm trees and ocean and it’s warm out. We’re all in pants and rolled up long sleeves. We’re not bundled up by any means. So I walk around the corner of this building on the lanai and I can see a bunch of windows. I can see into the kitchen where everything is being prepared. It’s totally cool because there’s a huge kitchen, super light and airy with maybe 15 people working. There's a head chef. I’m looking in the window and also at my reflection in the window, seeing that my makeup needs to be fixed. I have my makeup bag in my purse and start fixing it. I’m watching the server come back and tell people what I ordered. Now I’m watching a salad cook prep. The head chef is standing right there - they’re closest to me right on the other side of these windows. The people inside are all a twitter - they keep saying, “The queen is here! We’ve seen the queen!” They’re referring to me. I’m kind of giggling. The head cook looks up and he sees me on the other side of the window. Then the other people in the kitchen see me. They don’t register that I'm the queen and they’re being kind of cute with how excited they are. I’m laughing a little, seeing how excited they are. The head chef is the only one who realizes who it is. I’m watching as they make my salad. It’s a gorgeous salad and there’s a gorgeous vegetable platter that goes with it and it looks delicious. Then the head chef and I make eye contact. He recognizes who it is and starts to get everybody else to be a little more professional. He says, “Well, the queen is right here.” They all stop and gape at me, then go back to what they’re doing. I laugh and finish putting on my makeup and go back out to the dinner. Some time passes. The dinner happens. One of my brothers and a friend I’ve known since I was 7 - his name is Dorian but we call him Johnny - they go to escort me to a ball. It is dark now. There's lights on in the buildings and twinkle lights strung between trees. They’re escorting me from the lanai where the dinner was to where the ball is going to be. Johnny is so tall. In this dream he is probably at least 6 inches taller than he is in real life and he’s taller than me. He’s just really strong and big. I’m a little bit surprised because I know he doesn’t actually look like that and I’m also relieved because he’s playing a role of protector, like Captain of the Guard. Then there’s my brother who’s taking me along and making sure all goes well as I walk between the dinner and the ball. I’m noticing the warm breeze blowing off the ocean and the moon is out. It’s balmy and beautiful. It’s so lovely that I feel my heart is bursting because of how gorgeous it is out at night. It feels very comforting to have this super tall friend of mine and my brother on either side of me escorting me to the next place that I’m going. Then the dream shifts completely and the snippet from one piece I remember is I’m at my home. I know it’s my home and I own it. I’m in the yard. There are so many plants I recognize and they’re all plants I love. There’s three lilac bushes that are planted. There’s hollyhocks growing behind me, in front of the window. You can look into the window and see my living room. I’m relieved that the hollyhocks are there. There’s lavender and a bunch of medicinal plants - so all the herbs you need for keeping yourself safe and healthy. To my right hand side is my neighbor’s house and it’s kind of run down and derelict looking. There’s an RV sitting in their driveway. It’s brown and looks like a turd - not my favorite and I can feel that I’m not excited that I can see it. Back in my garden where I can see all these gorgeous plants and trees growing, I can see a space where maybe a cluster of five pine trees that have been cut down completely. You can see the tops of the stumps and they look kind of new. But part of them rotted and I know that those trees had to be cut down because they were rotting somehow. But I’m upset because I don’t like seeing trees cut down and it’s ugly. My yard is gorgeous except for this one spot where these trees have been cut down. Then I’m talking to the neighbor woman on the other side of me. There’s a fence between me and her. It’s a cul de sac, so I can see her driveway because everything curves. She’s trying to give me ideas of what to do with this area where it’s been cut down. I can imagine myself putting a picnic table on top of these stumps because they’re all the same height. So I’m imagining a picnic table and lights strung for gatherings. But this whole section of the dream, I feel a little bit out of place and somewhat agitated, in contrast to when it was my birthday and I was the queen.",Rose,last_nights_dream

We go in and there’s not much room. We’re hanging out with her and I’m looking at all the lovely things she has in her little artist studio. It doesn’t even have a bathroom and I don’t think it has a kitchen area - it’s literally just a shed with a bed on one side. She’s still really, really sad. I’m trying to cheer her up because I love the way she’s decorated the little studio. Her boyfriend shows up and her boyfriend’s name is Brandon. This guy is actually somebody I knew in high school - he was an upperclassman. There’s a little tension between them, like a depression. They’re together but they’re maybe together out of necessity or habit and they don’t know why. They’re talking and there’s a little bit of arguing. Now Gina is crying because she wants to go out and Brandon doesn't. Eventually I convince them all it’s going to be fine - let’s all go outside because this is a tiny little shed and we could use some room. We go out and it’s full dark now. There’s a fire pit happening somewhere. Brandon goes and sits near the fire pit. He’s tending the fire pit. It reminds me of those barrels that you see depicted in movies where you see homeless people standing around a barrel with fire in it - this is what it looks like. His body is interesting - he’s tall but clearly not taking care of himself. His pec muscles hang really far down way below where they would be normally. He’s kind of got a belly. He just doesn’t look healthy. The dynamic between the two of them is not healthy either. But we go out because there is stuff happening. I want to go out and cheer Gina up. So we go out and there’s other college kids lingering around. There’s stuff happening and I’m wanting to cheer Gina up, but Brandon just goes and sits by the fire and stirs it very melancholically. You can see Gina is torn about whether she should stay near him or not. Then the dream shifts completely. Now I’m in a really big cafeteria that the military would have their people in. It’s huge. The people that are in this cafeteria, I know some of them - some of them are old classmates - and I don’t know some of them. Everyone has a job and is doing what they’re supposed to be doing. It’s very orderly. It’s also in outer space because I can see there are people being dropped off at the cafeteria and they’re unloading from these hovering spaceships on one side. The cafeteria is open air with no roof - it’s open to the elements. So people are coming and going. I’m watching these people come and go and there’s this competitive energy in me where I’m sort of playfully running around and chasing them to put them in a headlock and wrestle them to the ground. It’s kind of a game, a little bit like tag. The atmosphere of the cafeteria is not heavy or serious. There’s play happening even though the play is who can wrestle who to the ground and who’s fastest or who can climb the wall the highest. That’s the atmosphere that we’re playing in. At one point my classmate from high school, his name is Amber, who is shorter than me by a lot, comes and teases me. I chase after him. He evades me. Other people join him. We’re all just running around. There are people sitting at tables, eating food, and people unloading from spaceships. Then I am face to face with somebody I know - his name is Eric and I also work with him at the grocery store. There’s total sparks between the two of us in the dream. And, there’s a baby. I have no idea where this baby came from. I think it’s mine. But he’s holding the baby and he’s like, “Oh, I sort of like holding the baby.” I’m like, okay. The people around us are sort of telepathically making the suggestion that he and I should get together and play house for a little bit. So I look at him and I don’t say anything but he’s like, “Yes, we should do that.” I’m a little bit taken aback because I have no idea why he would want to play house with a baby that's not his. The baby is mine, but not his. So now we’ve moved together through this cafeteria place as a unit. Then we’re outside of it. The baby has gone with my mom or dad. Eric has gone somewhere and come back. He’s in a costume of some sort and he’s asking me if I recognize who he is. I’m looking at him and am like, “It’s familiar but I can’t quite place it.” Somebody says, “You’re missing your gloves.” And he says, “Oh yeah my gloves!” Then I’m like, “Oh, your Hans Solo!” He runs off to get his gloves and I’m still somehow totally content because we’re doing the family thing. The whole time I have felt not trusting that he would show up. I feel like he’s just faking and wanting to either be with me or do the family thing. There’s also at least a 10 year difference between us - he’s at least 10 years younger - which is why I’m not trusting. But he seems to be with it and doing it. So I can feel myself take a deep breath and then I exhale and let go and just trust that it’s going to work out however. I have a mission to do anyways. So while he’s off finding his Hans Solo gloves, I’m getting prepared for my mission. Someone else has the baby this whole time. It’s a sweet little girl. She is maybe 1 or 2 or somewhere in there. I’m off for my mission with my friend Amber. I’m not exactly sure what we’re doing, but we’re walking through what looks like a desert. At some point we get separated. I’m trying to get back to Eric. There's what looks to be a huge rusted hull of a ship floating in the air - maybe it’s a spaceship. It’s coming at me and I for whatever reason lay down under it because they’re trying to set it on top of something to hold it. So I’m laying there in this place with pipes sticking out of the ground that they’re trying to set the hull of this ship. So I’m actually laying there underneath it. They set the ship down. As they do, the pipes are starting to be crushed and I’m starting to be crushed. So I’m rolling out from under the hull of this ship as fast as I can. I get pinned a little bit. I’m not exactly sure who comes and lifts the ship for me, but they lift it up so I can roll the rest of the way out. The thing that sticks with me is that I had been rolling just fine - I had been scooting to the side, but all of a sudden part of me got caught because I rolled the wrong way. It was very frustrating to me to know that I knew how to get out of this stuff, but I just made a really simple mistake. Then the dream shifts entirely again. It’s me and my friend, Aila. We’re in a car together, traveling. It’s dark or at least twilight. This place has trees and is maybe a jungle. We come to the end of our destination and park the car. There’s a cargo net that we have to climb like a ladder to get up to this man who is a sage - his house. You can kind of call it a house, it reminds me of a tree fort, sort of because you have to go up a ladder, but it’s also shaped like a mushroom. So we climb up into his mushroom. He’s sitting on a cushion smoking a hookah pipe. He’s a designer. He creates bathrooms - showers and nice toilets. We go up there and at this point a third woman has joined us - I don’t know who she is. We are looking at all the showers he’s designed and we climb into the one he has in the mushroom house for us to try out - it’s the sample. It’s really, really nice. We all decide we want one. Then he tells us how much he charges. Then we all start laughing because there's no way we can afford it. Then he shows us the piece of jewelry that’s made out of gold and it’s real actual gold. It's a bracelet made by a woman who’s a psychic and what she makes ends up being a talisman for you. So you wear this bracelet and it protects you. I can tell there’s something up with these bracelets because the material they’re made with is gold and also has heavy duty magic in it. I’m like, “Oh, we all need one of these.” He’s handing us this business card and points out on the business card the cost of each of them and it’s like at least $11,000 for each one of these bracelets. I laugh again and hand him the card back because again that’s not in the budget - neither the shower nor the bracelets. And we go to leave and as we're coming out, he’s having a meeting with a business man in a suit. We are being ushered out and that feels really strange to us. Then there’s more, but that's all I can remember right now.",Rose,last_nights_dream
358,1326,,18/03/2020,03/18/2020 00:02,"“Goop Eye” I am in my house and trying to teach my YTT (yoga teacher training). It’s not the students that I have in it in real life. It’s different ones that I don’t recognize. One of them keeps coming with her husband and he drives her there and then waits in another room while we do the TT and then drives her back home. He doesn't go home in between. He’s old - probably 75 kind of old, and he has a very slow kapha like nature to him and he’s a genuinely nice man. I notice after the first couple of days that one of his eyes - his right eye - is swollen. I ask about it and say, “What’s wrong with your eye? Do you need some help for that?” He says, “No, it’s fine.” Then the next day when they arrive, it’s even more swollen. I’m questioning him and asking him - should he not go and see someone about his eye. Again he says, “No, there’s nothing wrong with it. It’s fine.” Then the next day he comes back and it’s puffy and there’s this white goopy stuff growing around it and it’s swollen to the extent that there’s only a little tiny space between the upper and lower eyelid. I ask him if he can see out of his eye and he says no. Then I say, “Can I get a little better look at it?” He says, “Sure.” I say, “That’s pretty serious if you can’t see out of your eye.” As I get closer, now I can see in his eye. As I look into his eyeball, I see that there’s globules of this white stuff on the surface of his eye. I describe this to him and tell him what I see. He says, “Oh, that’s related to this food that I eat.” I say, “Well, shouldn’t you get that looked at because it’s getting worse?” Then I realize I have to make a decision because he’s in denial and refusing to get help for his eye and now it’s visibly got gook on it. I’m afraid that he might be infecting my group of students. So I tell them that unless he gets the medical attention for his eye, they cannot come back to the YTT. But I’m also worried that we all might already be infected. Then I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

360,795,,19/03/2020,03/19/2020 00:01,"I’m with a small group of people. We are breaking into a big house. Somehow, we climb up a trellis to a second story window. As we’re climbing in, a huge fireball shoots over our head and makes a big hole in the wall, going all the way through, singing everything in the house before making a hole through a bathroom wall and exiting. I’m worried about how the fireball has damaged the house and try to cover up the burned furniture, plants and art. I’m trying to get everyone out and to the street, so we can escape. That’s all we do, or at least all I can recall. In the next scene, I’m standing in a beautiful room on the second floor of a house. There’s a large window with a view of a body of water - either river or ocean. I look up at the sky and the clouds are so beautiful - they look like the white foam of ocean waves. So there is a beautiful body of water below and sky above. I’m in awe. Then a woman comes into the room. She is an indigenous woman with brown skin. She says, “I was referred to you for healing by some women in my Universal Peace Dance Group.” She lists the women, but I don’t recognize their names as members of my practice. Erin and Sophia. So she lies down on the bed - it’s not a chiropractic or massage table, but an actual bed with blankets and pillows. We don’t discuss her history or any of her concerns. I just start working with her and telling her about this work. Her body is responding and moving in a kundalini wave. It’s amazing to witness. Then I notice her hair - it looks like it is growing back from chemotherapy treatments. At the same time, my son is in the kitchen and no one is watching him. He’s playing with the water from the fridge. He’s pouring water into his cup. Then he notices me and comes over. I’m concerned that I don’t have anyone to take care of him and that he’s disturbing the session. But my client doesn’t seem to notice or care that he’s interfering.",Ana,last_nights_dream

362,1123,,19/03/2020,03/19/2020 00:03,"Holy crap. This dream. So the part where I start remembering is I’m in conversation with this guy who I know in real life. His name is Josh and he’s about 9 years younger than me and he had a rough childhood and spent a couple of years in jail and he does have a daughter. This is all background form real life because in the dream, he’s talking with me and he’s trying to court me. He’s showing me all the things he’s really capable of, but he has a little bit of a wild look in his eye, like maybe he’s a little bit out of touch with reality. Some of the things that he’s done, he’s been fanatical about his methods and how he trains his body and how he sets up his house (it’s all very precise) and how he has practices whatever catches his eye. He’s telling me about how he set up the way he was going to gain custody over his daughter. He tells me how he did it. It’s very, very detailed step by step. He asks me if I want to meet his daughter. A little bit of time passes in the dream. I’m in my home now - it’s not very descriptive, I just know I’m there. He rolls up in his car and it looks like a lifted Jeep or truck and it doesn’t have any doors. His daughter is sitting in the passenger seat. That’s my first “oh my god: - why are there no doors on the car with your daughter who you say you love and is so precious, yet that doesn’t look very safe. She’s filthy. Her legs are black from right above the knees down. Her dress is super tattered and her hair is pulled into a ponytail, but it’s falling out. There’s food on her face. She has a stuffy teddy bear of some kind and it’s also filthy. She’s about 7-9 I think. He parks his car and they get out and come into the house. I’m offering to make them a meal - I guess they’re coming over for dinner. She sits down at the table and she’s wild. She doesn’t really talk. She has this high alert look on her face. He’s just telling her what to do. He’s literally telling her: “Okay, now do this, do this.” He’s so proud of himself. He thinks he’s being the best dad. I’m like “oh my god, your daughter is wrecked.” I kind of get the sense that he literally stole her from her mother where she probably would have been better off. Then the dream switches and now I’m with the next man in the lineup. It’s my ex-husband. He’s different. He’s also trying to show me how different he is. He’s like more mature and emotionally more aware. He seems kind of fun and also seems capable. Energetically, he feels different to me - new - at least at the beginning. Although he does look the same. We’re outside meeting at what looks like a baseball park. There’s a chain link fence around the park. We're there and we’re meeting one of my clients and she is having a first date. I know the person she is having it with and I’m feeling really hopeful that they get along. I’m really excited for their blind date. I’m also feeling excited for my date with my ex because he seems like a totally different person. So, we meet up with my client and her date and we set out a picnic blanket on the field. First we all play together - we play frisbee or some kind of physical exercise. Then we’re lying on the blanket and my client is telling me how excited she is for her partner and they’re snuggling up. I’m laying on my belly and my ex is laying over my back. In the beginning it’s cute, it’s sweet. There’s cuddling happening. Then he falls asleep. My client and her date get up and go to work out. I try to get up because it’s my turn to get up off the blanket and leave. My ex is dead weight asleep on my back. I realize I have to stand with him. Now all of a sudden, there’s a crowd watching me to see if I can stand up with him, like: “Can she do it? Is she strong enough?” Since he’s already over my back, he’s essentially in the fireman’s carry hold. I do. I stand up with him on my back and he stays asleep for the whole thing. Now I’m like, “What the fuck? Why can’t you even wake up. You are just dead weight to me.” I realize that that’s not going to work. Then the scene shifts and now I’m with the next man. It’s my ex-boyfriend from when I was 17. He and I got together in that sweet summer between your senior year and your first year of college as a freshman when you feel pretty free and adult even though you’re not. His name is Ken. Now he has shown up in the dream. He’s wearing a baseball cap. This is significant later in the dream. We’re hanging out and i’s so fun to be with him. He is my favorite boyfriend ever But there is a possessive streak that is kind of freaking me out. We are together in this place that seems like a training gym for martial arts and other things - there are poles for pole dancing to train on and there’s also different types of equipment around, too. There’s these three younger men and they’re teachers or they’re trainers who are trying to get their legs strong. I overhear them and I turn around and say: “Oh, look here, you can do some of these exercises. This is what we do in pole to get our legs strong.” So I start showing them how to do leg lifts and whatnot. Ken is there and is watching. He is in part proud that I know this stuff and can teach it, but also very threatened that I know this stuff and can teach it. We’ve been having a really good time up until this point with lots of laughing and joking. He’s so attentive and affectionate. He’s very hands on, but in a respectful way. But I can feel that he’s getting agitated and I think that’s interesting. He wanders off to go punch a punching bag for a little bit. Then another man comes in. This is Luke. He is another classmate of mine. He and I always got along in real life - there wasn’t a sexual attraction, it was just friends, but I always just adored him. He seemed to be the sweetest guy who smoked a lot of pot. He did get mad at me once, but he forgave me pretty quickly and I remember being really grateful to him for not holding a grudge. Back to the dream: he shows up. I had been wearing Ken’s hat and I’d given it back to him. Then Luke shows up and puts his hat on my head. He’s taller than me. Ken was shorter than me - only about 5’6”, I’m 5’10” and Luke’s about 6’2” or 3” or maybe even taller than that. He puts his hat on me. It’s almost like I can hear his thoughts now that I have his hat on. He is saying: “Oh my god, I didn’t know how much I loved you, then I saw you pole dancing on your livestream for instagram and I’ve seen you strip.” And I’m like, “What? I’ve been stripping?!” Then I recall doing a little stirptease - seeing myself pull a little red dress down over my shoulders, and am like, “Oh yeah, I totally did that, but don’t know what it was for.” Luke is saying not so much that I want to be with you, but pretty much - you’re amazing and I didn’t know. In the meantime, Ken is getting pissed off. I see his face is starting to change along with his whole demeanor. Luke and I finish our conversation and I give his hat back. Ken is like, “What, do you think you want my hat back now?” He’s saying this like he’s not going to give it to me and I don’t care. I’m like whatever. I hadn’t thought of it and it’s not a big deal to me. We’re in the gift shop of this training center we were in and I find my own hat. I put it on. We’re walking through the checkout line so I can buy it. Ken has some stuff he’s going to buy and he very pointedly does not buy my hat. In fact he makes sure that I know I have to buy all my own stuff; whereas, before he would have been chivalrous. Again, it’s not phasing me that I have to buy my own hat, but his treatment of me is weird because it’s so hostile now. So I grab my own hat and we leave the training center. I get in the car with him and he drives me home. This is a totally different home than the first one in this dream. In this home, I am in an apartment. I go up at least one stair and I’m on a balcony - a lanai. I watch him drive away in his car and he peels out because he’s pissed out. I think that was the end of all the dreams. It was a crazy succession of men and I was left all by myself in the apartment - in this tower - thinking wow, “I really don’t want to be a part of any of them. They all seem so unstable!”",Rose,last_nights_dream
363,1327,,19/03/2020,03/19/2020 00:04,"“COVID Anxiety Dream” The setting is my elementary school. People are getting shelter in that school, like quarantine. I am one of those people. The whole dream is inked and soaked with sinister dirty energy. It’s just horrible. There’s the feeling that something or someone is going to find us and we’re hiding. Then for some reason, people start going outside. We feel we have to. There’s not a choice. So we start walking single-file and there’s quite a few minutes between each person as they exit the building. So first I’m standing outside by myself and it’s dark, it’s nighttime. Then I can still see the lights on in the school because I’m standing in the schoolyard. Then a few minutes later, someone else comes out of the building and a few minutes later someone else comes out. There are about five people. Then from around the other side of the building come two people. One of them is viciously stabbing the other person. There’s blood everywhere. While the attacker is occupied with the stabbing, the people that I’m standing there with are like, “Where are we going to go? We have to go somewhere where we’re not in danger from this person.” Then we walk around to the other side of the building and there’s a tuck shop on the lawn. We’re hiding around one side of the tuck shop which is closed. Then the attacker that was stabbing is covered with blood and is walking through the crowd because more people have come to gather around the tuck shop. They’re standing social distance apart. No one is standing close together. No one is huddled. So it’s not even really a group. There are about twelve people and we know that he might stab each one of us, but he’s not coming close enough. He’s just wielding the knife around and walking drunkenly.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream1
364,1328,,19/03/2020,03/19/2020 00:05,"“Wooden Ship” In this dream I'm on a really big, long ship made entirely of wood. It’s between 40 and 60 feet long. It’s shaped like an arc or one of the older viking style ships. The ship belongs to my friend Randy from high school. He is captioning it and he’s invited me to go out on the ship for a day. The wood is really old - it’s dry and cracked from the sun, there's no luster in it or polish on the outside. In order to make it sea-worthy, there's this thick almost hemp-like woven netting about 5 inches thick and tight weave that cascades down from the gunnels to the hull. It’s not on the bottom of the hull, it just goes way past the draft all the way down to the bottom. It’s got debris filtered from the water as it’s gone through. So there's no spaces between the weaves, between the organic debris and the tightness of it. There’s a ladder to climb up the side and it swings a bit with your body weight as you climb. So I climb up, wrap my leg over the top, hop down and I’m standing on the deck. Randy follows me and takes the wheel. We start moving. I can feel the sway of the ship on top of the water and am starting to enjoy the splashes that come up over the sides. The channel where we are is relatively busy. We haven’t gone all the way out into the body of water. We’re still going through the channel. I’m standing on the bow, leaning over, and I see rock - like a shelf of rock underneath the surface of the water. So I shout back to him: “Randy, it’s too shallow here, we’ll never make it through! We’re going to run aground!” He says, “No, no, we’ll be fine. I’ve done this before.” He’s maneuvering the ship and I’m positive it’s going to scrape because it looks like the rock shelf is only about 12 inches under the water and you’re going to scrape your keel. You’re going to get stuck there. The ship is still going over it. We maneuver over quite a few of these and come out into the open water where you don’t need to man the ship so closely. So I walk from the bow back into the cockpit and I say, “I can’t believe the ship just didn't run aground.” He says, “That’s because it has no keel.” And I’m like, “What?! So how are we staying balanced?” Then just at the same time, I notice there really is a lot of side to side sway of the ship, like it’s rocking and a little bit forward. I say, “Oh, that explains that.” The dream speeds through the day on the water like it’s just a minute and we’re coming back through this same channel. Now it’s time to tie up. I’m getting the lines ready. In order to tie up in this one place, I also have to climb up a ladder that’s on the inside of the boat at starboard. As I’m climbing up, I realize it’s not attached to the wall and it’s like 12 feet up. This ship is big. So I start to climb and I have to be really careful where I put my feet and balance so that the pitching of the boat with no keel doesn’t pitch me off with the ladder away from the sides. So I’m trying to counter this. I make it up to the top. Then I have to walk across the top of it. Now it’s a platform, like walking the plank. It’s only about 6 inches wide and before I get to the end, Randy comes up the other side. He’s a lot heavier than me and it unbalances me. The top of the plank comes up like a seesaw. But I jump down with the line and I’m okay. Now I’m trying to tie the boat up. He makes it over the side, too. I’m standing there talking to him saying, “How is this boat balanced without a keel?” He tips the whole boat in the water so I can see - it’s made of wood so it must be light plus it’s buoyant. There’s actually a hole, like a long skinny hole in the bottom. I can see where this fibrous netting has ended and the space at the bottom of the hull where the keel used to be. It’s actually a hole. I’m kind of nonplussed, thinking how the ship doesn’t leak and how does it work? Then I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream2

It was a different time period, maybe late 70s and a different place maybe Philadelphia or New York. It was dark outside and these men were moving the body of a younger woman, maybe of Latin descent? She had curly short hair. It was unclear if she was injured or dead. First point of view was from a distance, like from a car across the street, then it just showed them taking her down and out of the building, and restarted inside the building to the second point of view from one of the men moving her. I could see her clothing but not her face, it was vintage late 70’s style. Again, I was just taking her downstairs only thumping her body down each step this time. Then it zoomed out again and it was more of like a removed witness point of view, like I was watching the watcher (the first one). Then I woke up.",Vera,last_nights_dream

375,1124,,22/03/2020,03/22/2020 00:01,"There are three distinct parts to this dream. The first part I remember is a gathering of a lot of women - at least 25 of us. It’s a retreat and it’s towards the end of the retreat. It’s my friend, Carmen, who is hosting. She’s been doing a lot of the teaching. I’ve been in the mix, too. I’m not a participant, but I’m there. I can’t tell if I’m helping out with the retreat or not. She’s giving the ending teaching or wrap up of the retreat to all these women. They’re mostly older women - a little like elders in training - that seems to be the theme of the retreat. She’s giving them a speech, more or less, that’s along the lines of: “Okay, now you women have these tools. Go forth and do your eldering.” I am witnessing this and someone has asked me to go hang out the laundry, which is something I used to do all the time in Hawaii - I used to hang out all of the laundry for our house. We didn’t have a dryer. Then even when I moved to the mainland, in the summertime I would hang out all of the laundry. When I did it as a child, I resented it because it was just another chore I had to do and it was not my clothes, it was everyone else’s clothes - by everyone else, I mean the 9 other people in my family, so there were a lot of clothes. I am out hanging this laundry now for the retreat and I’m feeling frustration and resentment build because I can hear all the women who have been on this retreat and they’re all complaining. I’m thinking, “Did you not learn anything from what we just did?” They’re all holding hands with each other. They’re all in it together, complaining together, and also completely ignoring the fact that I’m hanging out their laundry. Or maybe not ignoring, but more that’s what I should be doing because I’m not an elder. I am so frustrated because all I can see is how seemingly selfish they are and that they don’t have anything to complain about. They're complaining about parts of the retreat and parts of their lives. I get so sick and fed up that I leave their clothes where they are and I walk away from the clothesline and I walk away from the whole retreat. I am thinking that I need to leave them all to their own devices because they don’t get it. That’s the thought going through my head. Then the dream shifts and I’m in conversation with my ex-husband about our daughter. It’s my time with them - we’re still sharing custody and visiting time. My son is there and he’s closeby - he’s with me. But my daughter is not there and I’m asking my ex where she is. He tells me, “Oh she’s at her friend Gus or Gum’s house.” I say, “Who is that? I don’t know who that is.” He tells me that he is a teammate of hers. She’s apparently playing soccer and this is her teammate. But she’s 12 and this boy is a little bit older - that’s the impression I get. I’m starting to get pissed off and scared because I don’t know this kid’s parents and they live in another county. There’s a little map flashing before my eyes and the place they live is highlighted and flashing and it’s far away from where we are - at least a day away by car. I’m starting to panic because I don’t know this kid, I don’t know his parents, I haven’t talked with my daughter in a long time and I don’t know what she’s doing and I don’t trust that she’s safe. I start yelling at my ex, telling her he can’t just let her go to places that he doesn’t know the parents or the situation just because she wants to hang out with a boy, essentially. He doesn’t get it. His face turns stone cold. I’m trying to keep my voice even and level. But the more he grey rocks what I say, the louder and frustrated I get until I’m just yelling at him. I’m so disgusted with him. His dad is the one driving my daughter down and back and he’s there. I’m just as mad and frustrated at him. It feels very much like they’re stonewalling me and taking my daughter. But they're putting her at risk is what I feel. I'm panicked and so upset but getting no answers from them. I’m asking them where this boy lives because I want to go pick her up, but they won’t tell me. So the dreams shifts again and I retain the panic. In the next shift of the dream, I’m hanging with some friends - some are from high school, some are from this time - other instructors I’ve met at the pole studio. We’re all outside. It’s a bright, beautiful sunny day. We’re walking down a paved path - it’s available for a lot of people to walk on. It’s me and another girl and another guy. Other couples are around me as well. We’re all walking and there’s space between the other couples and me and this girl and this guy. I’m noticing that they’re starting to hit it off. I can’t tell if I’m jealous or frustrated. I’m having an emotional reaction, but not sure. Some of it is that panic has carried over from the last part of the dream. Again I’m thinking, “You guys don’t really know each other. It’s probably not a good idea to hook up right now.” We all stop walking. We end up at some sort of grassy area. The couples have split off - they have their own blankets. This guy and this girl - there’s a sense that I know who they are, but I’m not seeing who they actually are - they split off, too. Everyone gets under a blanket. I’m watching and can tell that these two are hooking up. I’m like, “You don’t know each other!” I’m looking at this through the lens of us being in quarantine and I’m thinking it’s probably not a good idea to hook up with someone you’ve just met while we’re in this quarantine. I’m just really concerned again. Then somebody passes out bathing suits to all of the women. I’m watching as all of the women and all these couples put these bathing suits on. They look different on every single woman. It’s very interesting to see how it’s the same cut of bathing suit bikini, but looks so different on every single woman. I have one, too, and am trying to put it on. But I’m putting it on over my clothes and I don’t understand why I’m doing that, other than the thought going through my head is that I want the added layer of protection. Everybody else seems a little bit carefree and somewhat nonchalant about the situation we find ourselves in. It’s like they’ve hooked up with their person and it’s them and their person and they’re okay. But I’m by myself. I’m watching all these couples and the ones that have been together I’m like, “yeah okay, they’re good,” but the ones that haven't been together, I’m totally horrified and that sense of not just panic, but a little bit that I’m in the wrong frequency goes through all the dreams - that I’m just not in the right timeline. That sense, I woke up with and still feel.",Rose,last_nights_dream

It was overcast. I pulled into a parking lot and a woman was standing outside with a dog and talking to the news and then to me about washing her dogs - we kept our distance. Then I was visiting an acquaintance- someone I knew from a young widow’s meetup group years ago who married another young widow from our group and then divorced them. We were washing these grimy pots and pans off of the stove at his house which I’ve never been to and I asked about visitation for the step kids.

379,1125,,23/03/2020,03/23/2020 00:03,"I’m working with a friend and we’re having a meeting. She also has clients and we’re in her house. She’s showing them how she does some of her artwork - some of her painting. I’ve been doing emails for her and she's giving me some fabric that’s super cute. I quickly and nonchalantly sew up a top and skirt with the fabric. The skirt and top are cute and match the artwork she’s creating and is showing clients and friends right now. I’m working on emails and greeting cards - getting those uploaded to a computer. She’s in another room doing this meeting. She calls me in and we continue consulting with the client. She asks me where I got the outfit I’m wearing. I say, “This is the fabric you gave me. I turned it into a skirt and top.” It feels good between us - she’s my friend and my boss. We’re having a good time and I’m really enjoying working with her. Then the scene evolves a little bit. We’re in the same house area, but now it’s my house. We’ve completed our work and she leaves. I’m realizing there’s really weird stuff happening outside. I get it in my head that I want to call my ex-father-in-law who owns the mortgage on my house (this is actually true in real life as well). Because weird things are happening, I want to call and say, “Hey, there’s a freeze on all mortgages and rent, so I’m not going to get it to you this month.” I’m on the phone talking to him and I've gone outside. It’s a little bit dark and ominous. It is nighttime. A wind has picked up. I’m talking with him on the phone. There is no hello or anything; I haven’t even gotten out the words to ask him about the freeze. He says, “I haven’t received your rent check this month. And I’ve heard that there’s a drone outside your house and I’m a little bit confused.” He’s starting to fade out like the connection is bad and I can’t hear him anymore. But the gist of what he’s saying is that there’s a drone - somebody has been flying a drone outside my house and filming me. It’s at the windows and it films me. I feel super violated - like my privacy has been violated. He’s really shaming about it even though I didn’t know there was a drone there. But his connection finally dies and I don’t hear him anymore. I go to call him back and try to get a hold of him so I can tell him I’m not paying rent. I hear him say something about there’s going to be an inspection. Then the connection is totally dead. I feel concerned because now I’m worried about this drone. I head back to the house. The house looks like a Victorain era dollhouse - it’s got one of those roundish rooms that reminds me of a tower and a lot of frill on the trim. I’m walking towards the house, but first I’m in the parking lot. There’s a parking lot and what looks like low income housing - they’re all one-story, the roof is flat, they’ve got a carport, and they’re all connected like apartments or a motel, actually. I see a friend of mine and she’s got a couple of kids. Then there’s a sheriff and he’s inspecting the place, but giving her an extra hard time. She has the front door open and her kids are running around. He’s telling her: “Your house looks dirty from outside.” He’s making her show him her car which also is dirty. He’s totally just giving her a hard time. I’m watching to make sure that he’s not just harassing her. It feels like he’s doing his job, but going out of his way to be a total asshole. Then he sees me and he heads towards my place, and he’s like: “Your house stinks. It smells, especially right here on the back porch area.” There’s actually another guy waiting for me on my porch. I recognize him as my lover - I think - but he doesn’t look like my type at all. He’s got blond hair and blue eyes. He’s kind of tall and it looks like he’s just come from a football game because he’s got his football gear and he’s really sweaty, stinky and smelly. But I guess this is my person because I’m really happy to see him. He’s standing on this porch where the law enforcement person is telling me it smells really bad. I look and I see there’s a window seat that juts out from the house over the porch a little bit. Underneath the window seat is one brown wool sock and one bottle of forgotten soda or something. But the foundation of this porch is all stone and is rotted - there’s moss and it’s black and the stone is crumbling. My lover is standing up there and he comes down and he greets me. He shushes the sheriff and we start to go into the house. But my brother shows up. He starts to dig out the stone that’s rotted. I’m like: “Don’t do it!” I know that the smell coming from it and whatever is under it is supposed to stay under, like it’s an old ancient curse or something - kind of like they bury vampires. I’m like: “Don’t go in there.” But my brother starts digging it up. Sure enough, there’s a body wrapped in chains. It’s folded in on itself. As soon as my brother gets the rock off, it unfolds itself and it’s a king. I’m horrified: “Now you’ve done it. You’ve just let the bad guy out.” Then I hear some other rock crumbling. I’m up in the tower place now because it has all the windows. I turn and from my vantage point, I see that the queen has been let out, too. She’s also been in chains. They both have gunk on them because they're so old. I’m like, “Fuck, this is not good.” I’m trying to grab me and my lover - now we have to leave the house. Now we have to get down these stairs and past these things and out past the house. There’s a level of horror and also comedy because the queen is hideously ugly and she’s just bitching. She’s clearly very bad tempered and it’s a little bit cliche in that way. We’re coming down the stairs trying to avoid them and we do make it outside. I don’t know what happens to my lover - he disappears. I run into this 11 or 12 year old boy. He’s kind of playful and naughty - very much trickster energy. I can hear a voice that’s sort of narrating what’s happening with this queen and king coming out and this boy who is kind of teasing. He’s running off away from me and the queen and king are trying to follow him. I’m thinking that they’re the bad guys trying to catch this boy, but this voice that I’m hearing suddenly shows up. It’s a man with a troubadour hat with a feather and he’s dressed in stockings - like Shakespeare, old style. He’s got one of those frilly collars around his neck. It turns out he’s the one that either the king and queen are chasing, or he’s chasing the boy. I’m not sure. It’s a little convoluted. I just know it's time to get the hell out of there because whatever is happening is not my business. The house is a lost cause. I have no idea where my lover went. My brother is off - I don’t know where he went; he let these things out and now he’s gone. I’ve been heading towards a crowd, following this boy and watching things unfold and I just let myself get lost in the crowd.",Rose,last_nights_dream
380,1329,,23/03/2020,03/23/2020 00:04,"“There’s Crime in Cafes” It starts in an outdoor cafe. The cafe is covered by three walls and one ceiling. One end is open. I don’t really get the sense that the walls are impermanent. They’re pretty solid. The building itself is vast. I don’t even know how deep it goes. So there’s a self-serve area at one end - that’s the end that goes on and on and I don’t know how deep it goes. At the other end that’s open, it has long tables where you can take what you’ve selected and eat there with people. It’s packed. So, the dream opens and I’m sitting at a table. I’m not eating though. I’m waiting for someone that feels like my daughter, but doesn't look like her. She’s an adult. She arrives and we set off for school. So we get in a car and we leave the cafe. We drive down a long road - it’s about a half hour drive and I know this. I know we’re already going to be late. We park the car and walk across the street to the campus which is also really, really vast. There’s outdoor areas, walking paths that are cobblestoned, and then there’s the various buildings themselves on the campus. We walk across the grassy area and crosswalks. We go into a long low building to try to find our classroom. We have a schedule. But the first classroom we go to for our class is empty and we notice on the outside the door that it has moved. This is all making us even later. We go down another hall, around a corner to the left, look at the door numbers and we walk in the first classroom, which has obviously started about a half an hour ago. Despite that, though, the teacher welcomes us. We listen to the lecture. When it’s finished, we go to the room next door. There’s another teacher in there that we’re talking to and discussing our lessons. We realize that he’s trying to undermine the first teacher. We’ve gotten our lunch out and we’re sitting there trying to eat food in this classroom. He keeps kind of telling us the opposite things, so we’re taking mental notes with this. He finally leaves. We’re talking about whether or not we should tell this first teacher and we decide to. So, we do. We go back into the classroom and she’s still there. We share this information with her. She’s grateful. We tell her that we’ll see her the next day. So we leave the campus, get back in the car and go back to this outdoor cafe. At this point, I meet up with some other people. My daughter leaves because she has somewhere else she has to be - she has to go to work. I say, “I’ll meet you here at the same time the next day.” So while I’m lining up to go and get food, first there’s this thing that happens with gum. There’s a direction by the cashier - it’s a self cashier - that tells me to select two big tubs of gum in order to pay. I think, “Why are they doing this? I don’t even want all this gum.” So I follow the instructions and the first gum tells me to pay $50 and I’m like, “Oh my gosh! $50 for something I don’t even want.” However, I have to in order to get food. So I put the $50 in a little slot that looks like an ATM. Then the cash drawer springs open and it gives me $57 and I’m like, “Oh!” Then it says I can have the other tub of gum. Now the first tub of gum has disappeared because it has been used. It says I’m allowed to have the other tub of gum and just take it. I leave it there because I don’t want it and I think somebody else will use it. I pocket my $50 and I use the other $7 to pay for my purchase of food. While I’m doing this, I look over my right shoulder and I see this skinny guy with a pencil neck and a huge head with a big jaw. His sideburns have been shaved past his ears. He has brown hair and he’s wearing sunglasses. He tilted his head to the left and his left hand he rubs the side of his head. I’m like, “Oh no! That’s the wanted man that everyone is looking for!” He is wanted by the authorities and has been painted as a criminal. My dream psyche is in shock for being so close to someone with criminal notoriety. I decide he is gentle though and not dangerous. I hope that he hasn’t seen me. I shrink back into the crowd with my food and I go and sit down at a table. But I wonder what to do now that I’ve seen this wanted man. I start to look around. I don’t have a phone or anything. There's no pay phones. There’s just this open area of eating. I wonder who to report this to and how to deal with it. Then, I decide to follow him from a distance. So I abandon my tray and my food, and I start following him on foot. He leaves out the open air end and now the street is not just a road that goes to the school. It’s crowded and it’s like suburbia but with more vendors that have carts selling things. There’s people walking in the street. It’s making it difficult for cars to drive in. His car is moving really slowly, so I’m able to see where he goes. He drives up a little bit, goes a couple of blocks, turns off to the right, goes up another couple of blocks, turns off to the left where he gets out of the car and stops and goes into a house. I follow. As he goes into the house, I can see what’s inside it - I can see through the walls. He has lots of plants in the house. He’s cutting them with scissors, then stuffing them into ziplock bags. They’re fresh, what he's cutting. As I get closer and I see what some people have purchased - well, I don’t know if they've purchased them or if he’s just giving them to them. A couple stop and they show me what’s in the bag. They open it up and there’s green herb - it looks like basil and it smells fresh. It has that basilesh lemony smell to it. They say, “Yeah, it’s helpful during these times. Our stomachs feel clear and our heads feel clear. And it helps to purify the water. We’re going to put ours in our water first and then drink the water.” They say that the man doing it is a really nice man. He’s giving it away and he’s giving it to children. He’s helping people. I think, “Oh! Well he’s not a bad guy after all. I wonder why they’re looking for this person?” So I don't follow anymore. Also, the man is wanted because he is wanted by the people and the authorities. Looking back, I notice that when I notice him in the dream, he was brown. The texture of his hair was the color of fertile earth and his skin was thicker with dots like pockmarks, but not from acne, more like indentations in his skin, like his skin was aerated as soil would be. His clothing was brown like earth. That way he brought his fingers up and moved it up and down was the signature gesture is a gesture of thoughtfulness, patience and consideration. They are all really earth-like. The fact that he blended in with the crowd, not being recognized, this earthly being in coloring and texture and raising plants that could filter the water - he was taking toxins out. He wasn’t even charging for them. He was only giving one piece to each person, so people weren’t allowed to hoard. It was very generous. He was wanted. He was definitely a healer. I turn and I go back to the openair cafe. When I arrive there, my daughter's already waiting. This time, I’m late. We get back in the car and drive off to the school. This time when we return from the school, we stop and start to get out of the car and walk up the sidewalk. We go into one of the restaurants and I see my paternal grandmother. I wonder why she’s there. She’s wearing this wooly green dress, like a 50’s style dress - the sleeves come down to the elbows and it’s got a rounded collar and she’s also wearing a light scarf around her neck. She has a beret type green felt hat that matches it on her head. I think, “Wow, she’s dressed up really nicely. She’s in her good dress.” She doesn’t see me. In fact, we don’t have the capacity to interact with each other, I just know that it’s her. She’s moving from store to store or door to door along these streets. She's wearing gloves and she’s carrying a very small handbag. I respect the distance I’m supposed to have, knowing that I can’t just go up and interact with her. As she comes out of one of them, my daughter and I are standing in the road and she’s on the sidewalk. I realize that this might be my only opportunity to talk to her, so I break that wall and run up to tell her that she could leave me her dress and I’d wear it with honor. But I don't make it to her. It seems like I can approach her, but I can’t really. I wonder if she’s heard me anyway. As I turn around to go back to the car, I see my grandfather. He’s standing there woodenly, just gazing at me. He’s wearing his farm clothes - dungarees and a flannel shirt. This is the point when I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I got a gun and I was fumbling with it, I was so scared! I dropped it and it rolled down the floor (very sloped uneven floor). I ran to it and tripped and almost had it when the monster was standing over me with the gun. I shouted “behind you!!” And the baby turned and shot my mom! I felt so guilty it was my fault I ran to her and the baby was still shooting. I got the gun and shot it. It rolled very gruesomely all the way down the uneven floor to the door and down the stairs.

I’m filing for unemployment and looking for support. While I’m inside, I look out the window at my car. My car is a convertible and the top is off. A man is sitting in the passenger seat. He’s scruffy and older looking of mixed ethnicity - at one point he seems Chinese and another African. I make a move towards the car to tell him to get out, but then he slides a gun across his lap and points it toward me. The gun is upside down and pointed at me as a warning to stay back. So I don't say anything to him. I go back inside and a woman notices that I’m disturbed. She asks me about it, but she can do nothing to help me. So I’m at a loss. The dream shifts to the next day at the same time. I’m waiting for help. He happens to be inside, too.

He doesn’t seem to be threatening today.” I notice that he’s just standing there, leaning against a wall, trying to get help, too. Then I wander around. At the back, there is an outdoor patio and some of my friends are there. One of my friends suggests we have a glass of wine. So we go to order wine. There are so many choices, but no menu. So we have to guess and give words to the man serving the wine, describing the taste profile or experience we desire. He pulls out a bag of sarsaparilla and cloves and holds it open for us to smell. We enjoy the smell and he gives us a mason jar of red wine that has this flavor profile. While he’s serving us, he tells us that he used to have a job that paid $35/hour and he misses that regular pay because now he is just living on tips. We thank him and each pay him $5 for the wine and $1 tip. He says again, “I still wish I had that job where I was getting paid 35 a month.” I think, “Hmm a month? Didn’t you see 35 an hour? 35 a month is not a lot.” I don’t say anything, though. The dream shifts and I’m walking through a building. It appears to be a school. It’s on complete lockdown and all the doors are bolted - some are bolted shut and others are locked partially open. The halls are completely empty. The rooms are emptying. I’m carrying a glass of red wine in my hand, peering into windows and rooms. As I’m walking down one hallway, a naked and very full woman is walking towards me with a swaddled baby. It appears she has just given birth. We nod at each other, but say nothing as we pass. She’s the only person I’ve seen so far. I turn left and am walking down a hallway. I peer through a doorway and see a woman dressed in black. She’s squatting as if giving birth, but she’s already given birth. Her baby is on the floor beside her. She is wailing and keening. The carpet under her mouth is soaking wet with tears, saliva and snot. She is retching and I can’t tell if she’s actually throwing up. I walk past and then turn back. Now this same room is full of mothers who have recently given birth. This is a support meeting for them being facilitated by my midwife. I go in but am embarrassed to have red wine and put it on the desk. I leave, but forget my wine. I go back, but can’t find it on the dresser where I had placed it. Then the dream shifts. I’m in a very nice house with a loft where I have been sleeping and resting. I climb down the ladder and see one of my roommates from freshman year of college. She tosses me a baby food pack of pureed vegetables. It’s nearly empty, but I’m grateful to even have that little bit. The car from earlier in the dream has now been given to my brother-in-law. Now he has two cars - one for work and the convertible for the weekend and picking up girls.",Ana,last_nights_dream
384,1126,,24/03/2020,03/24/2020 00:03,"There are a number of women - I actually don’t know any of them. They seem younger than me, although we're all in our early or late twenties, but my perspective feels older as if I’ve had more life experience than your average 20 year old. We are in a school of some sort, like a college, but it’s a compound - there’s buildings everywhere. We are all at a fashion show. We have gone into this really big room. It has floor to ceiling windows. We’re trying on all the different items we are going to be wearing to walk the catwalk. It’s a lingerie fashion show. The thing is, some of the other girls who are younger than me, their choices of lingerie are not particularly revealing, which I don’t have any thoughts around. But my choices are. I’m wearing a black lace super cheeky booty short bottoms and the top is see-through lace and midriff. One of the girls is like, “Are you going to wear that?” I’m thinking, “Yeah, it’s a fashion show. Yes. It’s like Victoria’s Secret. We just walk down the catwalk showing off the clothes.” There’s a little bit of shame in her voice and I contract for a second and put a corset on over. It’s interesting this corset has sleeves. Then I look down and see that I’ve put the sleeved corset on underneath the black lacy thing, so you can see the black lacy thing on top. The corset is on below. I’ve also put on a skirt to cover up the black bottoms, but the bottoms are black and the skirt is an almost see-through light pink, so you can still see the bottoms. So I put that on and am like, “Okay, this is better. I guess.” I’m standing there watching some of the other girls walk down the catwalk, and then think, “No, this isn’t better. This isn’t what I want to wear. This isn’t me.” So I take off the bottoms and I take off the corset - I just sort of rip it off, although the sleeves stay on, which is weird because I have to take the sleeves off separately. Then I’m back in what I was wearing previously with just the black lace and it feels way better. We are inside right now, but we are all still milling about because it’s not time for the show yet. Then we get the word that we’re actually going to show the last piece of clothing that we’re all wearing outside. I’m like, “No way! It is freezing. It is below freezing. It is so cold outside. We can’t go out there in our lingerie.” So I find a coat and put some of the other layers - the corset goes back on. I go to the outside area where we are all supposed to be showing what we’re wearing. I realize I don’t have any boots on and my feet are going to freeze. So me and another friend stop and we swing by our dormitory room. I go in and grab some of my fur-lined boots. As I’m heading out to walk out to this place, some of the girls comment and say, “Never mind, they cancelled that. It’s too cold.” I am relieved. They say, “But it’s time for us to go to the cafeteria,” or someplace - it’s a big gathering area where there’s a ton of us. Now I’m wearing a very interesting hodgepodge of clothes, but it doesn’t matter because it’s time to eat and I’m hungry. So I follow them to this dining area. Up until this point there were only women in the dream, but now there’s men, too. There’s men and women all gathering in this communal area where there’s food available. I’m going through the line, trying to decide what to eat and I’m starving. I’ve ordered a lot of food. I have my tray and I’m putting it on my tray. There’s a friend of mine who’s with me - it’s a guy and I don’t recognize him, but he is somebody I know, somebody I am familiar with. I’m eating, but handing him food because he’s hungry, too. I’m like, “Here, eat some of this.” He’s making the comment that I’m eating so much. I guess that’s because I'm still wearing these clothes for modeling the lingerie and he’s commenting on how much I’m eating. I’m a little annoyed about that because what the fuck, how much I eat doesn’t have anything to do with my ability to model lingerie. There’s not a specific look, either. I’m just annoyed by the seemingly still narrow definition of beauty. So I actually just walk off after that. I take my food and leave. There’s a bunch of girls I’ve been modeling with - they show up and they’re like, “Okay, now we have to go here and now we have to go here.” So I’m kind of trying to follow along. They’re collecting something for a party and I’m not sure exactly what it is. They’re trying to get all of these things in order for the party. This is the part of the dream where it’s been building, this feeling of being a little on the outside because I'm just not quite in the flow of what they’re all doing. The stuff they’re interested in just doesn't quite interest me and the way they do it, I don’t quite do it that way. This is the point in the dream where it really shows up and I’m like, “No, no, I’m actually not even interested in what any of you are doing right now, your party or whatever it is. I think I’m just going to do my own thing. That’s where I leave and the dream ends.",Rose,last_nights_dream

I do this, leaving only a few flowers in a simple, lovely arrangement. Then I reach over the log to remove a flower lei and suddenly see the log is not a log, after all.

388,1127,,25/03/2020,03/25/2020 00:03,"I’m in a car. It’s like one of those black Lincoln town cars that other people drive you around in. I’m with my dad, I think, and maybe my mom. We’re heading to the airport. There’s a plane I'm needing to catch and of course I’m late. I am wearing all black and this is significant because where I’m going I’m supposed to be wearing all black - I don’t know if it’s because it’s a professional thing or what. We get to the airport. I’m trying to rush through security and rush through the check-in. My parents are sort of with me and also the ones providing the ticket - at least they’re supposed to have the ticket in their hands. I get through security and up to the counter, and the ticket is lost. It’s interesting because I’m seeing what looks like a little black swirl that has some substance and I see it float off to my left. I think, “Oh shit, there goes my ticket. I needed that.” So we're back up at the counter and trying to tell the agent that the ticket has been lost. But I’m not the only one. A lot of other people are also having trouble getting their tickets and getting onto this plane. At this point my parents fade out of the dream. Now I can see the plane on the tarmac through the big windows. It’s ready for us and we all need to get on it, but we don’t have our tickets or something is preventing us from getting on. The dream totally shifts from being serious where things are a little dark and dingy and I'm all in black. Now when I look out the windows onto the tarmac, the plane is this big cartoonish plane. It’s proportions are not correct - it’s really, really tall but really stubby. There’s these round stuffies - I think they’re cats that are alive but look like stuffed animals - being shoved into the back of the plane. Now the plane looks like a cargo plane and the back door is open instead of having two doors open like we’d walk down a jetway into it. It’s just got the cargo bay open. And the guys who usually load luggage are just shoving these stuffies, who are alive and excited to be going on a plane trip and bouncing all over the place, but also squabbling because they don’t want to miss the plane. They’re excited to go wherever it is that they’re going. I’m like, I still have to get on that plane. It’s important for me to go because wherever it’s going, I need to be there. I get the sense that it’s going to my next step in life - like my next evolutionary step - I need to get there. I don’t know if it’s the form of a job or what, but it’s really important for me to get on this plane. So I tell the check-in agent that I’m going, and I get myself out there somehow. I’m still in all black and this is very interesting because at one point I needed black shoes or black boots and the ones I had got ruined so my dad gave me his pair of black boots. But the outfit I had on before had these nice feminine very sexy black boots and now I’m wearing a man’s pair of black boots. I’m really irritated by how that looks and they’re a little too big, so it’s not comfortable. But I get myself out on the tarmac somehow. The cargo bay is now totally full almost to the ceiling with stuffies - they’re just piled on each other and there’s no seats anywhere. I’m like, okay I have to get on this plane. I get myself on, even though the guys who were loading all the cargo are like, “Yeah, you can’t go on there.” I tell them, “Whatever.” I climb up on top of all these stuffies and am like, “Eh, this will be a comfortable ride. I’m laying on a bed of stuffies.” And they’re all talking because they’re alive. Some of them are squabbling. Some of them are excited about where they’re going. Some of them are irritated because my elbow is in their face. But I have still managed to get on this plane and they close up the cargo bay. The pilot tells us we’re going to take off and the plane does. I don’t know where I end up because the dream totally switches to a completely different scene. But the contrast of me in all black on this bed of stuffies who are all white or really pale, soft shades of pink or purple! And I made it on this plane like I needed to lie on this bed of stuffies!",Rose,last_nights_dream

It was all nighttime and dark and quiet. At some point, just before I woke up, that’s when I realized I was cataloging things through my eye. I started to realize there was a human part of me that realized I was cyborg. That’s when the creepy feeling started coming in about not feeling anything. Then I woke up.

390,1331,,25/03/2020,03/25/2020 00:05,"“My YTT With No Voice” In this dream I'm in my old house on Sunnyhill Ave. People have gathered there to take a yoga teacher training with me. At the same time as I’m trying to do this, there is a move going on. So there’s boxes everywhere and there’s disassembled shelves. There’s some traffic in and out of the house unrelated to the teacher training where one lady comes to the house and she has five giant garbage bags of clothes she thinks my daughter will wear. I realize that everybody on the street is also moving and she’s trying to get rid of these. At first it seems like it’s nice, but my daughter tries them on and they’re just a little bit too small plus they’re things she wouldn’t actually really wear. I tell her thank you, but they don’t fit. Then she brings five more giant garbage bags. I’m starting to feel like instead of taking them down to the Goodwill herself, she’s dumping them off on me so I have to make that trip for her. I feel a combination of disappointed and frustrated with her own lack of responsibility. I go back into the kitchen to try and attend to my YTT. The students have gathered. I’m teaching them different techniques for meditation and they’re not paying attention. They keep talking amongst themselves about different things - not anything to do with the YTT. I keep trying to recenter them. At one point I start to raise my voice and I say, “You need to know this if you’re going to teach! I feel like none of you are taking this seriously. Do you not plan to teach? If you don’t plan to teach, then I’ll lower my expectations.” They’re of mixed opinion on this - some of them want to teach, some of them don’t want to teach. Then I say, “For the sake of the group, we need to be quiet so that people that need to absorb some more because they’re going to take it out into the world and be responsible for other people are getting the information they want. They can’t if the rest of you keep talking to each other.” Then the time of day ends when they’re supposed to leave and they do leave. They’re gone. I’m packing again - I’m packing things in boxes, I’m packing books. My ex-husband appears and he’s doing something else - he’s bringing more stuff into the house when I’m trying to pack. So he’s generally getting in the way. A day and a night pass and the group comes back for teacher training again. In the dream, during the day and night that pass, I actually go over to my neighbor’s and I sit down and we have a little conversation, just a comfort conversation between women. I go back home, sleep in my bed, do some more packing, then the YTT people appear again. This time instead of all of them, there’s only three. Two of them are couples and they’re there without their respective spouse and I say, “Oh, did they decide not to continue with it?” They say, “No, no, they’re coming.” I say, “Well, how are we going to catch them up on the information they missed?” Again I’m frustrated and I don’t say, you should just drop out. I’m trying to give them another chance to be responsible for the material. I do the training that day with just the three people minus the other two and it actually goes well. The three that are there are focused and I get some information passed to them. I’m not going to describe it, but it’s meditation-related. Then they leave. I do more packing. The packing is you get three things accomplished and two more get added on, so it’s a slow process. I notice that it’s Fall outside and it’s actually quite pretty. For a little while, I go outside and sit on the deck and feel that cool fall air. I notice how beautiful the brilliant colors of the leaves are that are starting to float around on the autumn breezes. I’m starting to feel a little more relaxed. I feed my kids and I go to bed. The next day, the teacher training is in full force - everybody is present. I speak to them about their absenteeism and the other two say that they’ve decided to recommit and they want to do this. The kitchen is even more disassembled and there is an empty shelf that my ex-husband has placed on the landing of the side door and leaned it against the side door. So no one can use that side door. I’m feeling that this is a little bit dangerous, but I don’t have time to address it and it’s way too heavy for me. As I start to teach the YTT again, the same thing happens where as soon as I start to gather any information to present it, people start talking amongst themselves and not listening. I’m starting to get really frustrated with them because they’ve said they recommited, yet nobody is doing what they said they would do. Then I hear something at the side door - knock knock knock knock. I walk through the kitchen to the side door. It’s this woman and she’s got a truckload of things she doesn’t want and she’s trying to force her way into the house, but the shelf is leaning against the door, so she can’t get in. As I watch her pound against the door and turn the doorknob, the door opens a couple of inches and then she’s pushing and pushing and pushing. The shelf is so big that it doesn’t even budge, so I just turn around and walk away back to the students. They’re still talking. I make one more effort to try and present the material that I need to and I raise my voice. I’m getting louder, trying to talk over them, but it doesn’t even work. My voice is incapable of being loud enough to pierce this cacophony of conversation. So in frustration, the guy to my right, I take him by his left arm and I squeeze it and I shake it a little bit. I say, “Will everybody shut up?!” They do for one second and they stare at me. I feel horrified that I’ve grabbed this arm and he doesn’t even register that I’ve done this. He just pauses for one second, long enough to take an inhale, then continues his conversation. So I just leave the room. I’m done with them. Then I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream2

392,1128,,26/03/2020,03/26/2020 00:01,"I am with a friend but I’m not actually sure who it is - there’s just a body and a presence near me that feels comfortable, like we’ve known each other for a while. We’re searching for a good coffee shop. I want breakfast and I want coffee, which is kind of weird because I don’t actually drink coffee with good results in real life. But apparently I want coffee in this dream. We’re walking through a town. We’re on the streets of the downtown area. It’s dark - like night time or really early morning. We’re searching for a place and we find a coffee shop that’s opened. It turns out that my friend Anna is working there. She does some of the coffee and baking on the side, but she’s actually an artist and makes beautiful jewelry and gorgeous leather handmade bags that she tools and paints. Her studio is part of this coffee place - it’s a room off to the side. I’m so happy to see her. She’s such a beautiful soul. And she’s so happy to see me. She’s showing me some of the pieces she’s working on. It’s an interesting interaction because there’s this air of how much we love each other and she’s so excited about all her work and I’m so excited about all her work. This other friend has gone off to find coffee or something - They’re not with me in the room with Allsion. Her studio reminds me a little bit of a curio shop - there’s the most interesting things in it and you can tell it’s her space. Then the friend comes back and tells me she’s found a different coffee shop. So we’re going there. I say goodbye to Anna after she shows me all her beautiful things. We walk outside and head to a different coffee shop. It’s really crowded and a friend I used to have who is in fact a barista is working behind the counter. I’m happy to see her, but also not. There’s a little bit of, “Oh no, I don’t want to go back here again with this longing to be friends with you, but you ghosted me” (which is what happened in real life). So I’m kind of glad to see her, but there’s also part of her that’s also sort of ignoring me. She’s got the excuse of being really busy in the shop and is just kind of giving me this professional courtesy or facade. I’m annoyed with the whole thing and order coffee and breakfast from someone else. Then the friend I’m with - the one who I still don’t know who it is - says, “Let’s go over here and sit and eat here while we wait for our coffee to get to us.” So, we’re sitting at this really long table that takes up a lot of space. There’s a bunch of people at it. They’ve welcomed me to the table and tell me the meeting is about to start. I’m like, “What are you talking about? I’m on vacation. I’m not doing any business. There’s no meetings.” They’re like, “Well you know this is a BNI meeting.” The way these things work is if you’re a member of BNI, you have to bring somebody new in. It feels like this friend of mine has brought me into this meeting. I didn’t know that was happening, but it feels like that’s what they had planned. I am so fucking annoyed. I do not want to be part of any BNI group. I do not want to do business in that way. I am like this is sleazy gross marketing - this is the same old shit that’s gotten us in the mess we’re in now. I am so pissed off. Then to put the cherry on top, my ex walks in, who was actually part of a BNI group. They’re like, “Oh D’s here! Great!” I’m like, “Oh my fucking god, get me out of here now.” He sits down and the only seat left at this really long table with like 20 people is the seat across from me and to my right. He didn’t know I was going to be there because the look on his face when he sees me is like, “Eh.” And I’m like, “Ew.” He sits down in the only seat and accidentally kicks me under the table when he sits down. I’m just like, “Fuck, you can’t even be neutral. You can’t even control your body. You’re in my damn space and I don’t even want to be here!” I still haven’t had any food or coffee, so probably I’m “hangry” - I just get up and leave. The coffee shop was crowded anyway and I don’t know where my friend has gone. I get up and leave because I’m really fucking irritated. I walk out the front door and it’s morning. It was night time - really, really early morning and still dark - but now the sun has come up and it’s that really lovely sort of grey period of the morning. I walk out of that coffee shop and am walking down these streets downtown. I'm walking down a hill. I can hear the ocean and I’m heading toward the ocean and what I think is the beach. Sure enough I come down off this hill and it opens up this sandy beach. There’s a pier off to my right. There’s a group of young children - boys and girls - being taught by an elder. The elder looks like an old Chinese man with a long beard and a long mustache and one of those hats they wear in the rice paddies. He’s teaching them some footwork for balance and whatnot - basically showing them how to be in control of their bodies. He’s also writing stuff out in the sand that they’re reading and learning from. It is in Chinese characters. I see them and all of me relaxes. I can hear the ocean and smell the salt water and I relax. I say hi to them. The teacher - the old Chinese man - acknowledges me. I know he has something to teach me or tell me. He points off to my left. So the pier is to my right and off to the left is more shoreline like sandstone bluffs - they aren’t too high, maybe 10 or 12 feet high off to my left. The tide is high because the water is touching these dunes. But when the tide pulls back, I look to where the old man has pointed, and in the sand are these little rose-colored gems or stone tiles that have been placed in the stand every 5 or 10 feet. They each have a design on them. I start to walk down this side of the beach and I’m getting wet because the water is coming up high. There’s shells at the tideline and beautiful smooth black and white rocks. But these pink, rose-colored tiles are in the sand every so often and I’m noticing them as I’m walking down the beach. They each have a different symbol in them and the dream ends there as I’m walking and looking at the shells and stones and symbols.",Rose,last_nights_dream
393,1332,,26/03/2020,03/26/2020 00:02,"“The Grass Bodied Bear” Here’s a weird dream. I’m in an apartment that is similar to an apartment I lived in on the top floor of a house on Windermere and Beach Blvd on the shores of Lake Ontario, although it doesn’t look the same inside. We are temporary visitors. We’re staying with another friend of mine because we need to be there - something’s going on and we can’t go home. We’ve been displaced. My friend is from the sail club and owns the apartment. He isn’t home when we get there, although we knew that. He’s told us it’s okay to go in and do what we need to do to make our dinner and stuff. We don’t need to wait for him. So we go in. It's my son and I this time. First we just rest on the couch. Then we get some water and rest again. Then it starts to get dusk. We’re hungry. There’s some confusion about whether or not we’re supposed to wait for him at this point or help ourselves to things that are in the fridge or go out and get food. We don’t have any food with us and we don’t know where to get food. So we end up waiting. We eat a few small things we found in his fridge. When he gets there he says to go out and pick up Thai food. He has already got some leftovers in the fridge that he’s going to eat, but he tells us where to go to get the Thai food. So we leave the apartment, go down into the street, and then there’s this complex labyrinth of alleyways and doorways to go through. But he’s given us really clear instructions. We go in the first building and there’s an internal door in the building. We have to find it. We do. We go through that door. It takes us into a residence, but it’s just a long rectangular room and they’re used to people going through. The door is at the top of the rectangle. We go through. They kind of give us the nod and we keep going. As we exit out the other door, there’s a turnstyle. There’s 1 of 4 directions we can go in and we have to turn and kind of go to the right, like a traffic circle, but you take the first exit. So we do this. Then we're automatically outside. We do another turnstyle to the left and go across the street. We have to go in one door, through another long rectangle room, out the other door, and then we’re on the street we have to cross and the Thai food place is there. We order, pick up the food and reverse our steps. It’s exactly the same. We walk all the way through this complex labyrinth, back up the stairs to the apartment and eat the food. Then he tells us that he has some family coming over and we need to decorate the house. He asks us for a little bit of help. We’re putting boughs of spruce evergreen greenery up onto an area above his couch. We’re creating some kind of living scene and placing some other red colored paper decorations around it. He says that every year he takes this bear and decorates down into one of the areas that we passed through on our way to get the Thai food. He says, “It’s kind of complicated though. I’m going to show you what it looks like first so you’ll know how to set it up when you get there.” The head of it is like a stuffed teddy bear. So you lay the head down. Then there’s a rectangle shaped box and you pour the needles that have come off the pine boughs over the years - a 2 or 3 kg but not heavy bag of needles you pour in, so it looks like the body of the bear. Then there’s 4 of these red paper type paws you put around the outside. It’s topped off with a collar around the bear that’s also red with a gold bell on it. So he says, “See, this is what it’s supposed to look like.” Then he gathers all of that stuff up, puts it in a bag and gives it to us. So we go down again - it’s exactly the same - down the stairs, cross the street into the one building, through the other person’s residence, the turnstyle to the right, turnstyle to the left, and through the other building. Only this time I notice there’s a gym off to our lef. Every time we go through this labyrinth, the buildings to the left and right become more and more clear. I can see farther and farther to the left and to the right in the dream. However, this time, I’m still following exactly the same pathway. Then in the building we crossed through in order to get to the street where the Thai food was, this time we stay there. It’s got a lot of people in it setting things up for charity like a church bizarre, This is where I’m to set up the bear. I do. Then we leave and go back through the same way. Back up the stairs to his apartment. Once we get there, he tells us we’re allowed to go to the gym to use the pool. I wonder why we have to use the gym pool when he has his own pool; however, I don’t question that. A bit of time passes in the apartment with small talk. We watch tv for a little while, then decide to go swimming. We go back through this route - down the stairs, across the street, through the first building. Then the second building - this time the person who owns it is female with short brown hair - she actually opens the door for us and says, “You’re not going to be able to do this for very much longer.” I think, “Oh, hmm, I wonder how else we’re supposed to get there.” But still, we go through the turnstile, the turnstyle to the right. Then I’m standing there and I see the gym is right in front of me. I walk into it. We use the pool. It feels really nice to be in the water. There's no one else in it - just my son and me. It’s not crowded. We float around for a bit and then towel off. We go back through the same way back up to the apartment. When we get there this time, some time has passed. Then he asks me to please go back and get the bear. There’s some danger of him going through this. Normally it’s something he does for himself - he sets it up and takes it down. But he’s unable to in the dream. So my son and I agree to go get it for them. So we go down the stairs, across the street, through the first building. We get there and that person says that the tenant no longer resides in the next place. The tenant who’s in it now doesn’t allow people to go through the building. So they make us walk down and out the front door. Then we enter into the next building through their front door. It’s like a store. Instead of it feeling warm and well used and lived in, it’s this fluorescently lit, white walled, chrome encrusted, sterile type building with the feeling of a hum of busyness in it, but no actual real people. There's no one to ask and no back door. I can't find the turnstyle. I think I pretty much know directionally where we would have gone, so I tell my son, “Let’s just go out the front door and I’ll walk up the side of the building and see if I can find the turnstyle.” So we do and I do find it, but it looks different. We go through the different looking turnstyle. Then I turn and instead of being able to just go across the street, have the gym be right there, I seea sign on the outside of the building. It’s the kind that would have been painted onto the brick. It looks really faded and has the gym name, but you almost can’t see it. In fact, if I hadn’t known it was the gym or where the gym should be, I might not even have noticed because now there is a whole bunch of other buildings around it that have all shifted and changed. I estimate that when I go across the street and enter one of these doors, it should lead to the building where the charity work was being done and where we’d left the bear. So I go. Those people are all gone. I look around amongst the stuff and kind of intuitively walk where I feel I’ve left the bear. I find the head. The grass body is gone. We look around and find the other four paws. The rectangle where you poured the grass into the body is gone. But I collect up the head and four paws. We turn around to go back and it’s changed again. I don’t find the turnstyle but I’m able to walk down through the street, back up through the front of the buildings and then as I look back, it’s all shifted again. I think it’s a good thing we got the bear for him. I find the street where he lives. We walk up back the stairs. I say, “We’ve found it, but the grass body is gone.” He says, “That’s okay, another one will appear.” I look at him and his face has changed. It looks like he has had a stroke. His eyes look the same, but one side of his face is dipping down and his head’s at an awkward angle. His hair is longer and he looks way, way, way older. That’s when I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

395,1333,,27/03/2020,03/27/2020 00:01,"“Dancing on the Edge” In this dream, it’s in a house that I don’t recognize - it’s not mine, I’ve never been in it. The set up is we’re all on the top floor - I don’t even know what’s in the basement. The top floor of the house as you come up the stairs at one end from the main floor is a sitting room. As you walk from that door, you go through the kitchen and you keep walking through the kitchen, you come to an eating area - dining room. Then straight ahead of the eating room are a few bedrooms. The doors are closed; we don’t see them in the dream. Off to the left is an upper floor sun room that has chairs in it and a lot of windows. The whole upstairs feels worn - the floors dip in the middle and there’s the old kind of linoleum tile that curls up at the edges of each square. The windows have a film of dust and age. The paint has dulled. The paint is chipped on the frames around the doors and you can see the wood through it. Dust has stuck to the cupboards in the kitchen and they look a little greasy. The furniture is all old and of poor quality. It’s full of people. The dream begins where I’m gathered with some people around a table in the eating area. We’ve divided up a number of tasks we have to complete. One of those persons is my yoga teacher from my teacher training. He seems to be in charge of it and is assigning tasks. Everyone is listening to him. So we’re divided up into groups of two or three people and we go down. I don’t see the stairs as we go down, but I’m just suddenly outside of the house on the sidewalk and in the street. In the dream, there’s no time devoted to the journey of going in and out of each store to pick up what we’re supposed to. I just know that we’ve done it. We’re back in the meeting place with our bags. They’re not a lot of bags. They also show signs of poor quality and age. We each only have two or three items in our bag. As we group up, it’s like a hydropole - a wooden post like that - and that’s where we’re supposed to meet. We’re supposed to return to the house all together. My teacher is there and he’s waiting for everyone to be together. As our group comes together, I notice that there’s one of those big grey steel boxes on the bottom of the hydropole. He’s got one hand on it. We’re reporting to him the items we could not find. Then he says, okay, I’ll show you where some of these can be found. He opens up the lid of the grey box and we see emergency supplies in there. There’s some medicine and all other first aid things. Then he says, “These are not to be used indiscriminately. They’re only there for emergencies.” So he closes it back up. None of us take any of them. We just know that they’re there and our anxiety, if there has been any produced by not finding everything on our list, is a little bit felt through the group like an exhale. Then we trudge back up the stairs to the top floor of the house. We take our things in. Everyone is putting them away in the various places. Then we reconvene at the kitchen table. Some other group has cooked some of the food and we eat. I’m not part of that group - I’m part of the group that goes out everyday and shops. At that point after supper, some people retire to the sun room off to the left. Others stay at the table, where we’ve got board games and cards - I stay at this table. Others have gone off into one of the bedroom doors - it’s now open, but it’s not a bedroom now. It’s turned into this other room where people are having a conversation and there’s chairs. Some are still in the kitchen sorting out what we have left for supplies. A few others, just a few, have gone into that other first room. So I play games, I play cards. The card game is slow to progress and is interrupted with conversation about the emergency supplies and whatnot. Then I hear music coming from the room that was a bedroom but has turned into a conversation room. I notice that people are dancing. I think, “Oh, that’s a really good idea. I think I need to go in there and just dance. So I do. There are about five or six people there as well as my teacher. We’re just dancing, not in couples, just more an ecstatic dance inspired by the music. Then, my teacher says something that I can’t remember. I say, “I don't think that I can dance with you. I didn't realize you were this tall.” He has walked towards me - the way people do when they’re dancing just facing each other. As he gets closer, he seems taller and taller. I think that I can’t dance with you, my head only comes up to your navel. But he leans over and says, “Yes you can, you can do it anyway.” And he puts one hand on my right shoulder, takes my left hand the way people would dance together as partners, but it’s like a polka where you go side to side, tapping your toes. I’m doing it! I’m thinking, “Oh, I can do this!” And we start to go in that pattern - to the right two, back to the left two, then you turn a quarter turn, you do it again, then you turn another quarter turn, and go in a full circle. It’s working. I say to him: “Look, if you press your big toe against the floor a little when it lands and you get a little more height, a little more bounce and it starts to feel lighter!” So we do that for a little while. It just works. Then, we stop. I think the music stops. We must have danced all the way from that front room, through the kitchen, to the back room. The music stops. We stop dancing. He starts to say something, but someone else comes in and says, “We need you over here.” So, the mood immediately sombers. We go back to the kitchen table. Everybody is gathered around and sitting still. We’re talking about the supplies and the way we’re going to ration them. That’s when I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream
396,1890,,27/03/2020,03/27/2020 00:02,"I took a nap this evening after work because I had stayed up late with stomach issues the night before and had survived mostly on coffee throughout the day. As I lay down and got comfortable, I noticed that I was entering a very vivid and spiritual head space. I was thinking about the spiritual decisions that I had made lately, and as I pondered, I began to see the smiling faces of unknown people drift before my eyes. One was a young girl, another a middle-aged woman. I took this as a sign that I had made the right decision, but then, the face of an older man with white shoulder length hair, a beard, and mustache came to rest in my field of vision. I asked him why he wasn't smiling and he said that he wasn't smiling because I was smiling. His point was that the fact that I was happy about my decision didn't make it the right decision.  I found myself in outerspace orbiting a desert planet. I zoomed in and standing on a cliff was an older Spock, though with more Romulen than Vulcan features. He was shouting at me and flailing his limbs as if to ward me off. His shouts were completely silent.  I zoomed away backwards from the planet and then found that I was a servant at a manor. A family was there, and at this point in my reverie, I was sufficiently drowsy to not be sure of my own identity. I didn't know who I was in the dream and was getting worried that I wouldn't be able to escape or find myself again. In the manor, I was in the kitchen where an old man was baking a cake. One of us held the cake in a circular metal dish before placing it into or removing it from the oven. The oven was stone with an arched door. I came to the realization that the old man was the real me and that everything was going to be fine because he was in control and had given me permission to go on my vision quest.   I walked down a passageway and the dream began to lose any narrative coherence. I began to see images of faces flash before my eyes. I remember seeing Doug's face clearly.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

400,1129,,28/03/2020,03/28/2020 00:03,"I’m at a party, it’s pretty swanky, like a cocktail party, and all my high school classmates are there. I’m feeling a little bit intimidated because they all seem to have these really well paying jobs and lots of prestige and I work at a grocery store. They haven’t said anything, but I’m feeling like, “Uh, I don’t really want to tell them where I work. That doesn’t feel super good.” Fear of judgment and all that. I’m making plans to hang out with one of my friends - we’re going to go somewhere, I think shopping at a clothing store. But I tell them, “Okay, I’ll be back.” I leave the party and the scene totally changes. I’m in a house that I’ve never seen before, but it's a house that’s owned by my kumu hula from when I was a hula dancer in Hawaii. The kumu hula was incredibly emotionally abusive and not kind to me. She was probably doing her best. I’m in her house. That was my hanai family, too, when I was in the islands, so I spent a lot of time at their house - way more time at their house than my house in my teenage years. So, I’m at her house, which I don’t recognize, it looks different. Her husband, Uncle Jay, is there - he was also my kumu and hanai family. They’re talking to me about planning how they’re going to remodel parts of their house and how it’s going to cost them money, but they finally have money for it, or someone is giving them money or they’re going to earn it. I’m there with kumu and her son who is also in the dream at his younger age (when I knew them, he was 4-8, so he’s one of those ages). They’re showing me how they’re going to do it. They’re really, really friendly - it’s now how I remember it when I left the halau. They are just trying to show me there’s different ways. I’m making plans for the next day and kumu actually says, “Well, come back, be here with me and help me work in the store.” So I guess she owns a clothing store and I have an option of helping her. We finish talking and I go to my room in this house. Another friend calls and wants to make some plans with me for the next day. It’s like everything is stacking up on this next day. My kumu is inviting me and she’s like, “We need you to be here - this is part of our plans for remodeling the house.” Then my friend is like, “Well I need you to come and do this thing with me.” Then there’s a third opportunity to do something on this next day and I’m feeling torn because I don’t know who and where I want to be, but I also know that I want to do my own thing. So, I end up at this clothing store. I remember going through the racks and there’s all these crappy t-shirts like you’d find at Walmart or Grocery Outlet. They’re on one of those round racks and I’m going through them and not impressed. Then one of my friends from the party appears and is telling me: “Oh, we’re doing all these things, come do this with me.” A second friend from the party comes and she’s like, “Guess what? Now I have a job at the grocery store.” She’s super proud of it and is telling other people and seems to almost be holding it over me that she has the job at the grocery store. But I had never told them that that’s where I worked. It’s just a repeat of this weird competitive energy from outside and also within myself, so torn about where to put my attention and focus and none of it feeling right and true to myself.",Rose,last_nights_dream

405,1130,,29/03/2020,03/29/2020 00:04,"I’m at the beach, so there’s the ocean, sand, and a building being built - it’s a gigantic complex made of all white materials, I’m not exactly sure what, but they look like panes of glass, but maybe not because they’re white and opaque. It’s a place for healing through sex. The person bankrolling it reminds me of Hugh Heffner because it’s gigantic, but there’s so so so much money. Everything is so nice. There’s a part where people come in, rent a room and stay there. Then there’s also the part where basically the sex workers live and work. That part is three stories high and it’s amazing watching it be built. It’s so high up. I’m watching these panels get put on. There’s another part of the building that is a really tall tower and the lower part of the complex which is just one story has all kinds of amazing amenities in it. So the sex workers, we all live and work in that really tall part of the building. It’s like a classroom, so people come up there and are taught all kinds of things - whatever they want to learn and find out about. There’s aso major healing of trauma happening thorugh sex with people coming back into their bodies, unwinding childhood molestations. I’m one of the sex workers who is also learning more skills - it’s kind of like you can attend workshops there, too, and get more skills. So I’m there and this guy that I’ve just read about in real life, King Noire, is there and showing me the ropes. It is the best time ever because you’re learning all about sex, so how is that bad? So, I can feel myself becoming an expert at it, so time is passing in the dream in the way it does where it’s sort of seamless. Somebody I know from the pole studio - she used to be a pole instructor, but also the coordinator - comes to the third story. She’s sort of a guest sex worker who we haven’t seen in a while. She and I and King have a fantastic threesome. Then the dream continues on in time. Other people show up. One of them is an old classmate who is also a sex worker and all of this is totally normal for her. Throughout all of this, the ocean is playing a really big part - I can hear the waves, I can see for really, really far because we can see through all of these opaque panels - we can see out, but people can’t see into the building. The panels are gigantic windows - like a two-way mirror. So the ocean is part of this the whole time because I’m constantly hearing it and seeing the sand down below. This building is also a work in progress. I can smell the saltwater because there are parts of the building where the paneling hasn’t been put up yet. So my friend from high school comes and this is all totally normal for her. She’s hanging out and we have other friends. Now we’re down at the beach. There’s a set of bleachers on the beach and a lot of the sex workers are down there mingling with regular folk. One of the regular folk is my boyfriend from when I was 17 - right after school got out but before I went to college. He’s appalled to see what I’m doing now, but he’s also there. He has come to the sex retreat place, but he is not open. He is very closed down. He is not open to trying anything. He is not open to even seeing me. I can feel there is actual hostility coming off of him like he doesn’t even want to try. My friend from high school who also knows him is trying to be gentle with him. He seems much more open to her and much more willing to hear what she has to say. But when it comes to me, I can feel the disgust and disappointment and he’s kind of pissed off. But there are other friends of ours around and they’re all down with the whole sex scene - everybody learn about your kink, your fetish, work your trauma. I realize he’s not going to come around. So, at that point I leave it as a lost cause and let him work out whatever he needs to work out and not take any of it personally. I head back to the complex. Up until this point, it has been a work in progress. It’s crazy. I can actually see a crane that is so tall - in fact I can’t even see the crane at the bottom, all I can see is the ladder that goes all the way up the third story. I’m saying third story, but it’s actually way more stories up than the rest of the stories because all I can actually see from my vantage point is the crane that’s holding these opaque pieces. There’s also all these construction workers putting the panels on the building. I’m horrified because they’re all hanging off these ladders that end and are just hanging in space. From what I can tell, none of them are wearing harnesses. While they’re building, the winds have picked up. It’s blowing some of the panels off and things are swaying in the wind. It’s a little bit hazardous and freaky. They’re going as fast as they can to get this thing finished, but it seems very dangerous. Then they do finish it. It’s this solid white opaque building that’s gorgeous. They all seem okay. Eventually some of the construction workers end up inside the building - part of their payment is they get to have time with some of the sex workers. I’m thinking that’s an awesome deal because it was a rather scary, life-threatening job they were doing. So their payment is time with some of the sex workers! The dream ends with me back inside this place where we’re all staying with white carpets on the floors and mirrors everywhere and every amenity you can think of and every sex toy you can think of and rooms and beds. The dream ends with me in the teaching room for the trauma-informed. There’s a whiteboard and I’m watching this older woman who is a Dom - she’s working with another older woman and they’re working out a sexual trauma that this older woman had about her brother having her give him blowjobs. I thought this was a very specific thing to show up in the dream, but that’s the trauma being worked out between the two of them. The older woman is crying and the Dom is writing stuff up on the whiteboard. She’s very encouraging and witnessing this older woman. She’s absolutely helping her move through this thing. The whole thing seems incredibly healing.",Rose,last_nights_dream

Other stores are around, somewhat like a shopping mall, but business. Downstairs there is a big theatre with a dance rehearsal in progress. People are gathering for an aerial dance class. I’m dancing in the rain down a street with a man - in a pas de deux - enjoying the thrill of being tossed, caught and twirled with such strength and grace. Another scene with blood. Another scene of a family dinner. The family is people of African descent, not a lot of money, living in a shabby but cozy home. They serve simple food. This family dinner happens once a week. The first week is awkward. I’m not really welcome because I’m not part of the family, but they allow me to stay and eat and return each week. After time, I am part of the family. Then there is a final dinner. I won’t be coming back. They will miss me and I will miss them. Another scene - a garden store. I’m collecting bags of soil, going back and forth to my car, looking for help, trying to keep distance.",Ana,last_nights_dream
410,1131,,30/03/2020,03/30/2020 00:04,"I’m on this field trip with a bunch of children - an entire school’s worth. They’re all 5th grade and younger, but not below 2nd grade - there aren’t really young children there. We’re at this state park. It’s gorgeous. There’s an open field that’s two football fields long and at least one football field wide. It’s on one side of the road that’s the entrance to the park. Trees line the road and the field. On the other side of the field there’s all forest and it’s pretty thick and dense forest - it’s dark and you can’t see really far into it. Then on the other side of the road it looks like a school with buildings that look like classrooms but also could be places or cabins where you can pay a fee and stay. I see a playground and a cafeteria or place you can eat where they sell the shitty food you’d find in parks - ice cream cones and corn dogs. There’s another building on the left hand side of the road with the big open field or meadow. The building is on the end of the field. The road goes down and stops at this huge wide river. On this side there are rocks or sands that go down into the river like a beach. On the other side are tall, tall cliffs that drop off into the river and it is deep on this side but shallow on my side. The river flows from left to right. This is a familiar river to me. So there’s tons of kids hanging around. I’m there. At first I thought I was a chaperone, but I’m not. There’s tons of other parents who are chaperoning all the kids. I’m providing supplies. I have bags and bags full of clothes for the kids to wear - the same dress for all the girls to wear or the same pair of jeans for everybody to wear. It’s really bizarre. I have a hundred pairs of them in all different sizes, so everybody has a pair. I’m also in charge of setting up and spreading out the food, but also telling people where to sleep. So I’m basically providing all of the basics for people and organizing it. It feels very much like I’m providing the most efficient way for everybody to get what they need. But I'm also participating in this sleepover campout as one of hte kids, too. So I’m not taking a parent role, even though my kids are there because while I’m providing all these things, I’m actually in my later twenties. There are some other teenagers or early twenties kids. So there’s a little bit of an age gap, but not so much. I’m definitely not in a parental role, per se. With the younger ones, I’m making sure they’re not going in the river and getting drowned. But me and the other twenty year olds are flirting, which is the craziest thing. I’m making sure everyone is sleeping and finding sleeping areas. I head down to the river and there is a path kind of like a boardwalk - it’s got wooden slats. I take this path and it’s taking me towards this other building. I’m not entirely sure what’s there. There are some laundry machines. One young man is following me. He’s blond and his hair is curly, shoulder-length. He’s very good looking in a very angelic way - the way they paint those angel portraits from the Renaissance era. He’s got his arms around me. I’m the older one, definitely showing him how everything works, but he’s very like: “I want to be with you.” I’m finding it strange because there is at least an 8 year age difference between us. I take him with me to where there is all this laundry piled up from clothes that all of these 100+ kids wore yesterday. I’m looking at it and realizing I’d rather be spending time with this person and I don’t want to be doing all the laundry for everybody and making sure they know where their assigned sleeping places are and making sure that they all eat. So I have just left food out for them to come get as they want. I have left the laundry, like “Yo parents, wash your own laundry if you want.” I leave them to their own devices to sleep wherever they want - parents you’re in charge and here are all the sleeping bags. They do, but they all end up being cold and hungry because no one is actually taking care of them now. But I still feel like I’m not the chaperone or person in charge - I don’t even know how I ended up with all of the stuff for everyone. I am way more interested in cultivating a relationship with this person, except that it’s very short-lived. We leave the building that has all of the laundry and other stuff in it. We go back to the group in this big field surrounded by trees. Everybody is milling around. There are a lot of cars parked in part of the field. I’m watching some parents drive off with their kids but not watching out for other kids. It’s giving me a heart attack because I’m afraid someone’s going to get run over. I leave this guy. He had his arm around me, we were walking side by side and at one point we were holding hands and kissing. But I left him to make sure some of the kids didn’t get run over. I turn around and he’s got a blanket over him - one of the blankets I provided. But now he’s with this younger girl who is younger than him, so I guess she’s teenage-aged if he’s in his early twenties. I’m like, “Uh, what the fuck?!” at how quick his attentions turned. So now I go back down towards the river one more time. I’m watching everybody. They’re awake and playing. Some kids are wearing the clothes I provided, but some kids are wearing other clothes because now they’ve got it figured out. Some are learning how to swim and there’s an instructor teaching them how to swim in the river. As I’m walking down the boardwalk again and there’s sand off to one side, I see that this dad has soccer balls in a huge jar. He’s showing the kids that there are three different kinds of soccer balls and they each have different amounts of energy and power. So he’s keeping them in the jar. One of them is a regular soccer ball - if you drop it, it bounces a little bit but doesn’t go very far. The next one he shows us, he says, “Yeah, look how much power’s in this.” He drops it in the jar and the jar comes back up at least five feet off the ground and you see this soccer ball make an explosion within the jar because it has so much energy and power in it. Then he says, “That’s not even the strongest one.” He grabs this third soccer ball and he drops it. When it lands, it’s in a jar again - somehow these jars are not breaking - and it bounces above my head. Every time the balls bounce, they flashlight. So it’s three different levels of power within each of these soccer balls. The last two have so much power that they have to be contained within jars. I’m kind of fascinated by it. He’s giving these kids a lesson. I’m paying attention, but then continue to walk by. Then I hear another kid (these kids are more like 12, 13, 14) shouting and he’s looking in the water. There’s a gigantic jellyfish that’s yellow with red long jellyfish arms - I don’t know what they’re called. It’s floating in the river and I’m like, “Holy shit! There’s jellyfish in this river? We should not be teaching the kids how to swim in here.” It comes up to the shore and then the fucking thing is panicking me becuase it starts to crawl on the land! There’s the boy who saw it and a couple other girls, and I’m like, “Y’all need to get away from this thing because it is crawling up the land and it’s going to sting you.” I stand on a chair, thinking it won’t be able to crawl up the chair. It doesn’t crawl up the chair, but it latches itself onto the bottom of the seat. It’s an outdoor chair that’s metal, so the seat is wire - like the crosshatch - and the back is a wrought-iron metal back. I’m like, “Holy shit! This thing is dangerous because it can crawl on land and it can crawl up a chair!” It has latched itself to the bottom of the seat. It’s giving birth and laying two jellyfish babies. I’m not even sure they’re jellyfish because they’re on land! I’m totally freaked out and trying to make sure that whatever kids that are nearby are out of the way of this jellyfish. I had been standing on that chair and then I step on another chair, then a few steps back. Then I go and tell all the parents to be careful of this fucking crazy jellyfish and don’t let the kids in the water because it came out of the water. This thing is horrifying me because it can walk on land and it’s in the water, so it’s that much more dangerous. I’m worried about the kids.",Rose,last_nights_dream

My entire perspective in the dream was from above as a giant who was moving the car down the road as if it were a play thing. I thought that this was fun and decided that I would drive dangerously swerving in and out of cars as they approached from the opposite direction in the other lane. At some point, I realized that this wasn't a dream, but was real, and that if I accidentally hit someone I would be arrested or even put to death. I kept driving recklessly and as we entered the park, I ran into another vehicle. I peered down through the tiny window of the car, and could see highly detailed modeled people, who though made of plastic, were still alive.

They invited me to sit and I didn’t want to, I wanted to go read in the sun but didn’t want to be rude. I was nervous the men wanted to flirt with me or make moves on me. One guy was signing copies of his book and tossed me his card and signed a book for me. I didn’t ask for one. Then he showed it to me, lots of foldout pages, maps and legends, tracking history of immigration of his people. I told him I wanted to do the same thing for filipino diaspora.

414,801,,31/03/2020,03/31/2020 00:02,"I am a passenger in a vehicle of some kind, I think it’s a train. I’m with other people and we are looking for our home. It’s night outside. We’re going past some pick-yards filled with old smashed up cars. Then we end up at a huge mansion in this cute little town. We walk in because it is our new home. I am most impressed with the kitchen. I love it because there are three different sitting choices - a half moon table at the end of the island with a couple chairs; a longer rectangle dark wood table for 6; and a pretty shiny off-white round breakfast nook with soft pillows on the two benches. To the right of the kitchen is a big formal sitting room and dining area. The dining table is large and gleaming white. It only sits 4. The chairs have mossy soft green cushions and the place settings are lovely - silver and cream with gold, soft green napkins. There is a fireplace with antlers on the mantel. It’s very nice, elegant, cozy and inviting. Off to the side of this large room is a small library/consultation room. Later in the dream, my mom has returned from a trip into town. She has a towel wrapped around her head as if she’s just come out of the shower. She is having a counseling consultation with a woman. The house is surrounded by a lot of space. I’m walking with my friend and housemate (I don’t recognize her from waking life). She steps on a dry place with branches and fallen leaves. The ground gives way a bit and we look at each other, astonished, and I tell her: “Keep walking!” As she keeps carefully walking, the ground continues to give way and we see that it is a mote without any water in it. The mote was dug around this house many many years ago. We are astonished. We look at each other and remember: We’ve lived in this home in a past life. This house has always been in our family and it is right that we have returned. So we continue to walk, moving the ground away with our steps and remembering/revealing this mote. Now I have to go into town for an errand. I’m a passenger in a car. The town reminds me of the outer parts of San Francisco where I used to live. I’m going to meet people for ice cream. At first I just order a regular ice cream cone. But then I see that the other people have chosen a crispy cookie cone. When I look at theirs, I want it because mine is just this soggy flour burrito wrap. I ask for the crispy cookie cone and they look at the board to calculate the cost. My order comes with four layers and each cone is $3, so it will be an additional $12. I think that’s too expensive and just take the regular one. It’s not very appetizing and I don’t love it but I eat it anyway. Now I’m being driven back with a realtor and I look out to see the windmill - it has been lit up with white lights and is sparkling and beautiful against the night sky and dark ocean. The realtor points out that they had to take away all the historic sculptures from the beach because the big giant peach was cracked and needed to be renovated. So they decided to renovate all the pieces that used to be in the carnival at the beach. I’m like, “Oh that’s sad they had to take those away.” I look out the window to the left and see that a house has been torn down. But they’re building a new house out of bottle caps. I’m amazed at this bottle cap house. On the way back to the house, we see a wonderful field and imagine going there to play and eat lunch. I know it will be a wonderful place to live.",Ana,last_nights_dream

416,1132,,31/03/2020,03/31/2020 00:04,"I’m with a man - I’m not entirely sure who it is. There’s a couple of other people with us. It feels very cultish - he’s some sort of guru and has some say over what I do and don’t do. It’s very unlike me. We are wandering through a park. There’s not a lot of people. It feels like people are in quarantine. There is a group of people that are gathered and they’re listening to music. There are maybe 10 or 15 of them inside of a tent - one of those white event tents and the musicians are in the front. My group with the guru go towards the tent - there's another section of the tent that’s been walled off and private and we’re heading there. When I get up to the group of people, I see a bunch of people I know. One of them is Maria. I see her and I’m like, “Oh my gosh! Hi!” She looks at me and is like, “Hi.” What’s really interesting is her face is really round and chubby. It’s her but her face is swollen or she’s gotten really fat but only from the jaw up. It’s a bit weird. I’m happy to see her but remembering that things did not end well with us. She’s looking at me and has a look on her face - I can tell that she’s trying to apologize. She wants to say something along the lines of, “I’m sorry things ended the way they did.” As I’m talking with her, the guru and some of the other group that I’m a part of (it feels like an open relationship type of situation, but not really because the guru is in charge and the rest of us are like satellites that are with him) are mad that I’m talking with Maria. The guru doesn’t want me to talk with her because I’m still feeling a connection with her. She’s obviously feeling remorseful about the way things ended. I can see that she’s trying to make an apology. I’m sitting down. Maria and I are sitting on these 3-legged stools talking to each other. One of the other people from the guru group comes up to me and tapes a stone onto my wrist. It’s clear scotch tape and the stone is very flat, no bigger than 2 inches long and maybe a quarter inch thick and maybe an inch in width. It’s smooth and polished - like marble or granite. So he tapes it to my wrist and is like, “The guru wants to see you. He doesn’t want you here. He wants to remind you that you are his and you need to go back.” I don’t want to go back. I want to finish this conversation with Maria. We’re talking. The tent was separated, so the guru group is in one area and the musicians and everyone are in the other. I feel somebody grabbing my foot and pulling me from the stool I’m sitting on, under the flap that separates the two parts of the tent and back into his space. Maria is a little concerned and upset because she wants to finish talking with me. But she’s also very curious and wants to know about the group. So she follows me in and I watch as the guru guy works his magic on her. It’s a brainwashing that I’m watching happen in front of me. So I’m sitting there and back in the circle talking with other friends, expressing that I’m upset and don’t want to be there. The guru is teaching and trying to give some kind of wisdom and I’m like, “This is bullshit.” I’m not impressed. There’s a woven cocoon thing that looks like a basket-weaving with reeds, the size of a birdfeeder - it looks like those ornaments that are narrow on the top and bottom and get wide in the middle and are long, and it has a hole opening for the birds to come in through. The guru is weaving it while he’s talking. All of a sudden, Maria is with me and I hear her starting to orgasm. I realize he’s making a spell as he’s sewing and completing this birdhouse weaving. She’s sort of against her will but also totally enjoying it. I’m sitting there thinking, “What the fuck?! How did this happen? When am I going to get what I need?”",Rose,last_nights_dream

420,1133,,01/04/2020,04/01/2020 00:03,"There are a couple of parts to this dream, but I’m not remembering much of the first part except that I’m in a larger house with two-stories - a little bit mansion-y feeling because it’s got an echo - like an open two-story house with high ceilings would have. It’s nighttime and I’m sitting at a table and there’s a single candle lit. A couple of my brothers are around and we have either just gathered for dinner or we’re gathering for dinner. We have a conversation, but I do not recall it. The feeling sense it left in me is that there was some discordance. The dream shifts and now I’m in a factory, sort of, like a production place - things are being done here. It reminds me of where I do stocking at the grocery store - there’s always stuff coming in and has to be put away and shelved and whatnot. There’s a walk-in freezer in this place we’re in and there’s stuff being prepared. There’s also a kitchen where stuff is being prepared. There’s a lot of making and preparation going on. It seems that the crew is mostly male from what I can tell. Some of them are people I know, some not. One is a server I used to work with named Sam. Another one is someone I work with at the grocery store - his name is Aaron. So those two are there and I recognize and know them. And Gandolf from “Lord of the Rings” is floating around. I don’t think he’s overseeing anything; his presence is just kind of there in the mix. It reminds me of Gandolf or Merlin. So the pace is a little bit frenetic. I feel incredibly out of place in this warehouse. No one has given me a job. They just said something around the lines of, “You’re on this crew. Now go help.” I don’t know exactly what to do, and it feels like every single one of my efforts is wasted because somebody else has already done the task that I’m doing or I’m not doing it correctly and somebody else has to come behind me and redo the task. I’m seeing butchers cutting meat and we are selling turkeys that need to be brined, so we are brining turkeys. Eventually I’m like, “Well I’m just going to brine my own turkey and bring it home to my family,” because that’s what I want. As I’m doing it, I’m wondering if I’m going to get in trouble because a) I’m not working and b) I’m not paying for this turkey. So I get it in its brine and I put it in the freezer and I shut it. I go back to watching people do stuff. It has switched from a warehouse production setting to a dining room. So now it’s a dining room in a restaurant or AirBnB. There are servers everywhere. The meal is over and they’re clearing the tables. It’s like when you have multiple events back to back and you have to keep the same stuff out, for efficiency’s sake - when you turn tables in a restaurant, you don’t change the salt and pepper, you just leave them on the table. All of this food and stuff are coming off and I’m totally concerned and am like, “Well, we should probably change the tablecloths because they’ve got crap on them.” But nobody else seems concerned about that. I go to help and again, same as when I was working in this warehouse, I’m behind. It’s like everybody has already done everything and there’s nothing left for me to do. In the meantime, I’ve been observing Sam, this server friend of mine. It’s still mostly men but there are a few women. So there's’ this woman that Sam has had a crush on and he has not talked to her. It’s kind of like I know and a lot of other people know - it’s pretty obvious. It feels desperate - he’s desperate to talk to her and she’s pretty oblivious. The dream gets a little weird here. She walks off a balcony and faceplants two or three stories down, kind of like she was deciding to kill herself. We all know and we go in to tell Sam and say, “Hey you missed your chance with this woman because now she’s face planted on the sidewalk outside.” It’s Merlin who goes and tells him and is like, “Hey, you need to do something now, because you’ve kind of missed your chance.” So Sam goes out and does the same thing - falls off the balcony and lands next to her. They’re not dead. I think he does get a chance to tell her, but she’s very disoriented and can’t take in what he’s saying. She gets up and comes back up to work and he follows her back up. They’re back at work. Merlin or Gandolf is trying to tell Sam very specifically what he did wrong and what he needs to do differently to get to this woman and help her and come clean with how he feels with her. It’s reminding me that the masculine does not know what to do in relating - does not know how to relate to the feminine. Merlin, the divine masculine, or a facet of him and the magician, has sort of orchestrated this whole thing… because while everyone is jumping off balconies, no one is actually dying or getting hurt. I can hear the sound of Merlin talking to Sam, but I can’t hear the exact words and it’s driving me a little bit crazy. But I know it’s on purpose that I’m being left out of being able to hear exactly what Merlin/Gandolf says to Sam.",Rose,last_nights_dream

It’s a very rural community. I get the sense it’s on an island. In real life, I’ve been to St. Lucia which is a volcanic island, and although it doesn’t look like St. Lucia, it has the feel of a volcanic island. I think that’s where I am. It’s definitely the ocean - the waters are that aquamarine, crystal clear and you can feel its vastness. The sun is shining brightly and it’s ricocheting off the water. It’s so beautiful. There’s a pale sandy shore, it’s not white, it’s just pale. You can also see that the sunlight is refracting from the individual grains of sand. We are each in our seaside community, scurrying around, gathering things. Some people are gathering shells in these wide baskets which have been woven out of some kind of frond. I seem to be circulating in between groups of people. I feel like I’m counting something. I’m taking stock or tallying. As I approach each person or small group, some people are collecting by themselves and others are gathering in pairs, maybe a group of three but no more than three people. As I approach each single person or small group, they hold out and show me what they've got, I become the watcher. I’m way up - my perspective is pulled back as though I’m a bird in the sky and I’m looking down on our small island and our community of people. Then I zoom back in and I become me in my body again and people show me what they’ve got. I don’t really remember what people were showing me. But I remember the person that had the shells and I had some kind of conversation about the shells - what kind they were and how many and what we could do with them or trade with these shells. I remember another man telling me that he found some new place to find food and he brought a few samples. All I remember now is continually pulling back from the group, becoming the bird’s eye view, the watcher and then zooming back in. the last time I zoomed out in the dream, before I woke up, I remember thinking that there was enough. Everybody had enough. There was going to be a fair exchange. I was feeling proud of the group for their resilience, their innovation, their resourcefulness and their working together as a community.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

There is a tantra retreat happening at the same time. The living accommodations are all quite disappointing and dilapidated. The mattress is old, flat, sagging and overused with broken springs and mold. The paint is peeling on the windowsill and the whole place feels like it’s falling apart. The shared bathroom is absolutely disgusting. The floors are wet with pee, the toilet paper is soggy from the humidity in the air. The people in the other workshop have left these grey innertube style structures over the bathtubs and toilets - the toilets look like big chairs. There’s nothing I can do about it because the other people were supposed to take care of their stuff. In another scene, I’m getting dressed with a group of women. Ella (from my priestess studies) is looking through my closet to help me choose an outfit to go to the dance club. She wants to find a floral drape she gave me years ago, but doesn’t know I got rid of it. She chooses a floral top for herself. I tell her it won’t fit her and she holds it against her body, and it’s clear to all of us except her that it’s too small. She thinks I’m being selfish rather than honest. My outfit is denim shorts with layered and fitted floral tops and a long necklace with a clear crystal at the end. The necklace hangs down between my thighs and I find it just very odd and uncomfortable. There’s another scene where I’m waiting at a studio to take yoga or dance.

I remember thinking in the dream that maybe this is her core energy that is covered by everything else. Or maybe this was before something happened? She asks me if I can dance ballet. I say, “I can’t do pointe, but I can dance some.” Then she wants me to dance or show her. So I start to do ballet. I leap into the air and as I leap, I start to fly. I start flying up in the air in circles, dancing around her. She’s below and is amazed. There are other people below me, looking at me and are like, “Wow!” At a certain point, I realize Sabrina can’t fly. Then I realize the things I can do that she can’t do, which has been a theme in a few of the dreams with her, even the dark ones - I can meet her power and am even more powerful than she is. I’m struck by that in the dream. At a certain point, I’m dancing and flying, then the air of the Holy Spirit goes into me through my yoni.

He gives me a green antique book with some writing of his and his name on it. But it doesn’t say Keanu Reeves, it says his long original name. I don’t remember what the name was, but it was crazy long. There was a very antique’y poetic way of asking me out and his contact information was in the book. So at some point, I remember telling him, “You know, I just started seeing someone,’ like I just started to date again and was dating one person.

There’s a bike race going on. I can’t tell if I’m a part of it or if my partner is a part of it. I have a partner, but not somebody I recognize. We have a dog together and we’re outside somewhere that’s part of the race. There's bikers going by. But there’s also this very strange element - they’re calling them land sharks. But they look nothing like sharks. They look like oversized pigs, actually. The snouts are really elongated and look like the front of a shark. They have four legs. Their bodies are pretty wide and tall. So I’m watching these bikers bike their race and these land sharks keep showing up and are the same size as the bikers. I have our dog and I’m going to take our dog out and run on the beach. My partner, this man, is pissed. He is so mad. He is like, “Why are you taking the dog out? It’s going to be eaten by the land sharks.” Then something strange happens where I am simultaneously watching all of this happen and also the person taking the dog out. Suddenly, it’s not me with the dog, it’s my high school friend, Connie. She’s the one with the dog and her partner is scolding and berating her. It’s a very gross dynamic. She brings the dog back and puts the dog in the back of the car. She lays down and she’s clearly depressed and upset about it. I’m definitely the observer in this piece, where I went from being the one in that role to observing and feeling appalled at the way her partner is treating her.",Rose,last_nights_dream
430,1335,,03/04/2020,04/03/2020 00:05,"“The Monster Outside the Window” In this dream, I’m sleeping in a room on the upper floor of a house. I don’t recognize the house. It has two windows that are gabled. In front of one of the windows, entering in the room, is a closet - it is not a very big one. It has two bars on either side of it with clothes hanging on. It’s probably about 7 feet from the internal door of the closet to the window. I can see the window outside of the closet. It’s almost like the closet, if you look right at it is a closet with solid walls; but when I’m in bed, I can see what’s outside of the window - both of them at the same time. So it’s almost like the walls have color and appear to be dense, yet I can see through them. The dream starts with me going to bed and I wake up in the middle of the night. I can see there’s something terrible - something I’m afraid of - outside of the window. I’m afraid to move in my bed. I don’t go back to sleep and I stay there until the morning. The day just passes in a blur. Then I go back to bed and again, I’m trying to go to sleep, but I’m awake because I know that thing is going to come back and it’s going to be outside my window again. In fact, I start to realize that it’s always outside of the window. Then, as I’m lying in bed awake, I start to get a little bit curious about what exactly it is outside of the window. So I get out of my bed and I open the door and I peek into the closet. Nothing happens yet. So I open the door a little wider and I go a little bit more into the closet. Now I’m just standing in the closet. I can feel its presence through the window pane. I’m just standing there. As I’m standing there, my ex-husband comes into the room. He starts making noise and stuff. I say, “What are you doing in here? Please stop.” He ignores me and comes into the closet. He says, “I have to get a shirt.” I tell him to stop, “Stop doing that, you’re going to disturb it.” But he doesn’t. Then the thing starts to come closer to the window. Then I realize that my ex-husband and this thing are in some kind of tango together. I realize that it’s not actually me - I’m not involved with it. So I back out of the closet and into my room. Then, there’s some other event, but it’s like the first night of the dream where I know I get up, I don’t stay in my room, I go and do some other things… but they turn into a blur. So I’m involved in this other event. Then I come back into the room and it’s night time again. My ex-husband is gone. I feel that thing that was outside of the window is now in the closet. But since I know that it kind of belongs to my ex-husband it’s not really there to scare me, I feel less frightened about it’s unknownness. So I try to get into my bed. This is pointless. I know there’s something in the closet. So I get up and again I creep over to the closet and I open the door a crack. I’m slightly afraid of what I’m going to see, but much less than the very first night. I open it up and there’s someone sitting in there. I don’t know who it is - it’s a stranger - and it’s not talking to me. It’s just sitting there. I stand there for a little while, unsure. Do I want to interact with it? But now I’ve opened the closet door, so what am I going to do now? It stands up and it’s a man. The stranger. Then the room shifts, it deconstructs and it’s not the bedroom with the gabled windows anymore. I’m in the front hall of a house, maybe it’s the main floor of this one because I had been on the upper floor in the bedroom. Then I’m involved with this other kind of transaction. Now the front door is opening and there’s someone on the other side of the door. A barter is going on. I’ve lost the rest of the dream.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

We are driving past caged animals - wild animals - on both sides. We see elephants on both sides. On one side, the elephants are very calm and we comment on their parasympathetic nature and how unusual it seems in this confined space. The elephants on the other side look thin, agile and strong - there are mothers and calves. Someone who works there opens the gate to allow the animals to move from one side to the other across the road. A beautiful black gazelle leaps past us into a field. We get out of the car and follow the gazelle to see it up close. In the field, we come across two warthogs eating flowers. We’re close to them and someone remarks on how unusual it is to be this close without them charging at us. Then that seems to remind the warthogs of their nature. They lift their heads and start running after us. We run away as fast as we can. There’s a huge brown cow of elephant proportions so we have to run wide so she doesn’t kick us or knock us over with her long tail. Then I see my mom and dad riding a cow like a horse. My mom reaches down to catch my hand and pull me onto their cow. It nearly pulls her and my dad off the back of the cow. The cow is still running, but thankfully they are able to pull me up and we are able to escape. Then the scene shifts. I’m in Costco with my husband. We have an empty cart and we’re in the area where people eat pizza and hot dogs, but no one else is there. I see a sign with my husband’s full name on it. He’s been called for an appointment and now that he’s arrived and we’re done, they put the sign up higher on the wall to be reused.

Then I’m in a garage with a client from waking life. She’s talking with me about a few different magic shops in town that she knows about. There’s one called The Hidden Sword.

435,1136,,04/04/2020,04/04/2020 00:04,"Multiple parts to this dream...but with a lot of the same characters throughout. It starts with my ex and I. We have the kids and he’s my ex. I don’t like being around him, but we’re there for the kids. The kids are younger in this dream - maybe 6 and 8. It's our daughter's birthday (she is the 8 years old). They’re setting up for a birthday party in this room that doesn’t have a whole lot in it. It’s a simple square room with an ugly brown carpet, not all that big. Her friends are there. It’s like last minute - I wasn’t aware this was happening - so there’s no food, no decorations, nothing. But her friends are beginning to show up. I’m wanting to vacuum the floor, get all the toys off of it. There are a couple cookies getting ground into carpet. I’m also working on a project - I’m doing some sort of hand sewing and it’s in its own project bag on the middle of the floor. This is all stuff I’m trying to vacuum up and pick up before her friends arrive, so we can set up tables and whatnot. But everyone ends up coming before I can complete the vacuuming and before I can pick up the handwork I’m doing. My ex just starts setting up tables and putting out food. It’s the grossest premade food you buy at a deli from Safeway - no nutritional value. I’m horrified because I would never feed that to my kids, but that’s what he’s got and that’s what the kids are eating. They are playing and having a good time and eating this food that is so not nourishing and gross. Then the dream shifts a little, the party ends and we are taking the kids somewhere. We’re in a van - one of those Astro vans - it’s brown. I’m observing the van driving and I see it hit a rock. We’ve veered out of the lanes on the highway and hit some rocks on the side. So I have no idea where our destination was, but now we’re pulled over and we need some help. We’re kind of out in the boonies - it’s like sagebrush and open sky and not a whole lot of houses or anything. Somehow, somebody shows up. It’s a cowboy looking guy in boots and a hat. He’s like, “Hey, get in the truck. We’ll help you.” So the kids and I get in the truck. My ex disappears from the scene at this point - I don’t see him and don’t know where he goes. This cowboy is really nice. He takes us to his home or community center where we can get some food, wash up and go to the bathroom. It’s on an Indian Reservation and it turns out he’s Native American. He’s really welcoming and really kind. I’m like, “Oh god, here we are on the reservation.” I’m feeling like, eh, the white people, I don’t feel good about being there because of our history. But the kids are fine and making friends. This cowboy is handing me these little flyers, they’re 4x6, maybe a little smaller, and holographic. On the front, they say funny things which I can’t really remember. On the back they say, “Donate your blood and you can turn this flyer in for pizza,” or some other food. Again, it’s all food that I don’t eat and am allergic to. But the kids are like, “Yes mom! Let’s give blood so I can have pizza!” I’m like, “You’re too little to give blood. You guys can’t give blood. It’s up to me.” The kids take these cards and they’re so excited. We have been in this community center, and when we go back out, everyone from the reservation has gathered. There's music and food, like a potluck or luau. There's at least 100 people and a council going. You can see the people who are on the council of this tribe. Then there are other kids running around, couples everywhere, pregnant mamas..it's just a huge family and huge gathering of the community and celebration where everyone is feeding each other. There’s music and debates going on with the council and all of this stuff. My kids are like, “Yup, let’s do it!” It doesn’t even phase them. They just take these little flyers that the cowboy gave them and take them to aunties at the tables of food. They get food. I’m just watching the aunties feed the kids, no problem, just like, “Here’s the food.” My daughter is sticking a little close to me. But my son is like, “Come on, let’s go, it’s not a bit deal.” He’s charming all the ladies and they’re feeding him and making sure he’s fed. He’s going back for seconds and thirds - he’s a growing boy, so he’s eating a ton.” I say, “But don’t you guys need us to give blood?” They’re like, “Yes, you need to give blood. You need to give something, but not for the kids.” I'm like, “Okay, I can't give enough blood because I don’t have enough Iron. So I just won’t eat.” They’re like, “That’s fine.” So I’m watching the kids and they’re fed and that’s good. I’m feeling happy about that. Then I walk around this corner to see the entertainment. As I do, I squeeze past a group of people. I’m standing where I can see and I feel this arm wrap around my waist. I look and turn my head - it’s a young Native American woman who is pregnant. She goes, “Oh, I’m sorry, I thought you were somebody else.” I look at her and say, “Oh that’s okay, it’s totally fine.” Then she says, “Well, I’m going to give you a hug anyway.” It was really sweet. We talk a little while we’re listening to the music. I keep an eye on the kids who are just now folded in, eating and running around with the other kids. I’m starting to let down my guard. I feel more welcome, like it’s okay for me to be there. The conversation is flowing easier between me and everybody else because me and this young woman have been talking about when she’s due. There is just more ease in this setting. Then the scene goes from this outdoor place to indoor. I think we have all gone back into this community center. There’s a CrossFit competition about to happen. This is where my ex shows up again. He’s going to compete. I’m like, “Oh you should not be in there with everybody else.” The first workout is double unders and he has this super fast super special jump rope. The cowboy who picked us up is the referee or the one counting the reps and telling everybody when to go. He does the countdown and my ex just has a regular jump rope. I see him jumping and not going very quick. The other contestants are all Native American. They’re doing okay, but these double unders and CrossFit are not their thing. I see my ex go to his gym bag and pull out this special jump rope and special arms. He starts jumping and it’s like he barely hops off the ground and gets 4 rotations before he jumps. He’s moving so fast, it’s ridiculous. It seems like he’s cheating, but it is graceful to watch. The timer ends and he gets 1,400 and something double under jumps. The next highest score is somebody who has around 1,200 double unders, which is still kind of amazing - I don't know how long they were jumping. This whole time I’m watching, I’m thinking this isn’t equal, but the Native American contestants are doing just as well without the special rope and arms my ex had. He only had the advantage because he had that special rope. They had kept up for the most part in the old-fashioned way with a regular jump rope.",Rose,last_nights_dream
436,1336,,04/04/2020,04/04/2020 00:05,"“The Lecture Hall” The dream begins with me leaving the house I live in. I’m going to walk to a lecture. I have a backpack on. I’m wearing a raincoat. It’s quite a hike, but that’s not unusual for me. I like to walk. The walk takes about an hour. It’s just straight up a street, block after block, tree lined and very pretty. It’s a small town. It’s like walking up Cathedral Avenue in BC with huge trees that form an umbrella - they reach toward each other overtop. So I don’t even feel the rain. It’s raining out, but I’m not feeling it on my body or my face. I’m not getting wet. I arrive at the place where the lecture is and it’s a house. I realize that it’s the house of my professor, M.M. So, I walk up to the side and knock on the door and she answers it. The door opens out into her kitchen. She’s happy to see me, though we don’t hug. We stand about 6 feet apart, respecting social distancing. There's several other people in the kitchen and they're all in some kind of process of removing outer clothing and hanging it up on hooks. Then we go down the hall from the kitchen, into an enormous university style lecture hall where there’s theatre seats and a stage. At this point, M.M. disappears and I realize that the lecture is not on the psychology topic I thought it was on, but it’s two men who are standing there and they’re kind of counting the number of people that they have. I can overhear their conversation. They’re saying that they thought there’d be more than this. But, “this is a good turnout anyway and let’s hope we can sell it.” I think, “Oh, man, I’m not here to buy anything,” and I’m disappointed. So the two men walk down the aisle towards the stage. They don’t even mount the stage yet, when people start leaving. Then the one man stands to the side and the other one gets up and stands behind the podium and he begins to talk but doesn’t say anything. More and more people are leaving until there’s only 3 or 4 people left. Then he ceases the talk and says, “Well I guess that was a bomb.” Then I’m like, “Oh good,” because I wanted to leave, too, but there were people on either side of me and I didn’t want to make a big deal about getting them to get up so I could leave. But they were leaving, so I was glad. So now I have to get my backpack and everything again. But during this moment, there’s this crowd by the door and I see M.M. again. I go up to talk to her. She’s got a man standing fairly close to her. She says, “I’m so glad to see you. It’s been a long time. I can’t give you a hug, but I can dance with you.” So she reaches her arms out and we interlace fingers. It’s the dance where the one partner spins the other partner a half turn and your hands stay clasped with your arms over your head and then the arms straighten, you move away from each other, hands stay clasped, then the next time you go all the way in so the arms are crossed in front of you, you take a few steps forward and a few steps back, you do the half turn again so your arms become uncrossed but still stay laced at the fingers. She does this a couple of times with me. During one of the times when we’re shoulder to shoulder, I say, “It’s not okay to hug, but this is okay?” She says, “i don’t know!” Then we do the step one more time. The next time we’ve lengthened arms, she releases my fingers and steps back. She introduces me to the man, but doesn’t say his name. She just says, “this is my friend.” We give each other the shoulder distance nod in recognition. I say, “This is your house?! I’m surprised that you’ve moved.” She says, “Yes, I had to downsize and I have a tenant that lives upstairs. He’s a really nice man. Just go out onto the veranda and check it out.” So I do. I open the other door, walk up the steps, look at the door outside, look at the architecture a little bit, and come back down. I’m thinking I can’t believe this opens up into a lecture hall, but I don’t comment on the size of that. Then I just look around the kitchen a little bit, make some other comments about the design and the architecture. I’m admiring it. They’re all complimentary. Then, she says, “Well, it was nice to see you.” I say, “Yes,” and tell her I need to go before it starts raining harder. So I go back into the lecture hall. Now my coat is on a coat rack - one of the tall ones that has a hook on either side and stands like a post. I begin to arrange my things. But now I’ve got two pillows and a yoga mat that I have to roll up and arrange with the backpack. So I put my raincoat on and then I roll the yoga mat up. The yoga mat is really thick and has clips and ties on it. I roll it up tight and squeeze it so the air goes out and it rolls up into this little stick. Then I wrap the clips around it, hook them and intertwine the hooks against each other so it will stay really tight. So now that’s taken care of. I put it on the bottom of my backpack. Then I put my raincoat on and think, “What am I going to do with these two pillows?” Now, I’ve got two raincoats. So the second raincoat - I fold the arms up and the hood down and I roll it up really tight and I squeeze the air out of it. I manage to get that in my backpack. Now I’ve got these two pillows. I think, how am I going to do this? They won’t fit in the backpack. I don't want to carry them. I don’t want them to get wet because they’re down-filled. So I put one against my back and then it takes me ages to reach my arm around to find the loop of the backpack. While I’m doing this, the two men that were to have the presentation are starting to gather their things up, too. The one comments to me: “Sure is taking you a long time to get your stuff on.” I don’t answer him. I just continue getting my stuff on because I think he’s just stated the obvious and it doesn’t require a reply. Then I finally find the second loop to my backpack - I get it around, I pull it against my body so the air squishes out of that pillows and I think, “Alright, I’ve done it.” Now I have to do this again. How am I going to slide this other pillow down? I consider asking the man that I just ignored if he can slide the pillow in between the back of the backpack and the other pillow. But I don’t want to talk to him. Then I see the tenant come down from M.M.’s apartment at the top floor of the house. So I go walking back up out of the lecture hall instead. M.M. is still there talking to some people who are continuing to exit. She says, “Oh wait a minute! I want to introduce you to my tenant.” She calls him the Chinaman. I think, “Wow, why doesn’t she give him a name?” He shakes my hand and I shake his. I say, “How long have you been living here?” He says, “Sixteen years.” I exclaim, “Sixteen years?!” and I look at M.M. and say, “I didn’t realize when you said it was a couple of years that it had been that long.” This is only significant because I haven't realized it’s been that long since she’s moved there with a tenant and I have not seen her. We chat for a little bit. He seems like a nice man. I ask him if he will slide the pillow down in between the other pillow and the back of the backpack. He says, “Sure no problem.” He does that. Then I say goodbye to everyone. I’m all packed up. I leave. I have my stuff. I go back out into the drizzling rainy day and start walking back down the avenue and that’s when I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

440,465,,06/04/2020,04/06/2020 00:01,"I had a dream I showed up in this house in the dark with the lights on. It was a cottage. There was a group of people already there. I knew I had been there in dreams but not in real life. It was attached to another house behind the driveway. The house had brown shingles with white icicle lights on it. I think it was winter. I was looking inside a window. There were people and they all knew each other but I didn’t know them. I think it wasn’t their house either- they were sheltering there where they were able to survive. There was an old dog bed that did not match the dog in the picture on the counter. I felt sad. There was a peanut butter jar, and I had a taste and threw away the knife and this made the group tell me (they spoke to me as one, not as individuals): “that was a rookie mistake!” But it was not friendly. It was immediately safe but also dangerous, and I could not stay. I did not fit with them. I went to the back of the house and down to a small restaurant. There was a Jacuzzi with a lock on it. I think the dream before that I was walking the streets and there were police out everywhere.

441,806,,06/04/2020,04/06/2020 00:02,"“A Seaworthy Vessel” I have built a big raft for the ocean with a group of about 5. There are other vessels that have also been crafted and will be used in the ocean, possibly for a race or competition. Then I am having lunch with a wealthy and well-connected couple. We are waiting for their son because they want us to meet. They think we will really hit it off. He arrives and there is an immediate attraction between us. The attraction is flirtatious and easy and a wonderful sense of finding somebody new with a very physical and soulful connection. We are looking forward to seeing each other again in the evening before he has to leave the next day. So there’s a sense of urgency and depth, along with loss. I leave the lunch and go shopping for clothes with my mom. It’s very busy, like a mall store, with young women sorting through clothes. I’m distracted, so she goes along with a laundry hamper style basket and fills it with different clothes, a huge variety. While I’m perusing through clothes, I see a couple young women recieve devices like you would get at a restaurant to light up and buzz when your table is ready. They go to the changing rooms in the back. After a while, they return the devices, because they were waiting too long and needed to go. Then somehow I just slip into a changing room in front of a bunch of other people because I don’t have clothes in my arms. Then my mom brings me the basket of clothes, pushing it under the door. They are all different styles and I try them all on. They’re all great and I love them all. I’m surprised about this. My son is on the outside waiting with her. At the bottom of the basket are two stuffed animals - one is a duck with two heads - one on top and one on bottom, the other is a frog or turtle book. I bring all the clothes to the front and put them down with the cashier. I don’t even pay attention to how many clothes or the price, and I just give her my card. I’m happy to have these new clothes and will wear one of these outfits tonight to meet my guy. Then near the end of the day I’m walking on the seashore with my son. I see my friend, Jeremy, swimming in the water in a wetsuit, looking under the water for sea creatures to point out to us. He gets excited and calls us over. We plunge our faces under the water and look through rocks and seaweed. We see what he’s pointing out. It’s a little puffin nodding its head up and down and holding a black plastic ring that would go around a can. Then we are all surprised by an otter who jumps out of the water right next to the penguin. We are delighted by the otter and its sleek fur. There is a sense of joy and attraction in sharing something so wonderful. Then I’m in a shop. It is Jeremy’s shop. It’s a sound healing and crystal shop (he does not own such a shop in waking life). He has pounded together different crystals to create a special one that you tap with a mallet and it emits a sound frequency that is a healing frequency needed for this time. It had to be intuitively made by a person with a combination of earth crystals. The shop is closed except for the two of us in there. The door to the hallway with the bathroom is propped open with a Himalayan crystal light. Now it is nighttime and stormy in the dream. I am pushing off into the ocean in my raft with only two of us. So we have lost our competitive edge. We bump into another raft we were supposed to be racing, but they also only have two - they have lost their competitive edge as well. They were supposed to be a group of five as well. The waves are erratic because of the storm. It’s imperative that we stay together rather than compete in a race.

443,1137,,06/04/2020,04/06/2020 00:04,"Dreams are getting weird...I’m in this dream, but I am an observer. I do not have a body, I am not taking up any space, I am just watching it all happen. There is a black man and his two daughters. He is showing them how to ride trains for free because they’re really poor and they don’t have money for a ticket. So he showed them how to get on these subway trains for free and ride where you need to ride it. They’re riding on the outside of the train. His daughters are maybe 9 and 11 or maybe 11 or 14. I’m watching them. I’m not even on the train. I’m watching from outside the train. This train is underground, kind of like a subway because there are walls around it and me. They’re on this train and it’s going in one direction. They are on a trip and traveling cross-country. But his daughters get very fearless and bold. They decide to do train hopping and take what he’s taught them and get on any train they want. Sure enough, they’re on this train and they see another train passing them and going in the opposite direction. They were heading one direction because they were heading across the country and then the daughters hop trains and the father is upset. He says, “Hey don’t do that, now we’re going in the wrong direction plus you could kill yourselves.” But it’s too late. The daughters are already on another train, so he has to hop it and get on with them, so he doesn’t lose them. So he gets on this other train. Now they go from being on top of the train down inside the train where there’s other people. There are all kinds of other people on this train. All kinds of ethnicities, races. It’s a mix of white, black, Asian, Indian, Pacific Islander - everybody and all kinds. They’re all quirky people. They have their own idiosyncrasies. They’re each working through some sort of story - they’re living their own personal story out on this train and they’re kind of interacting with each other, but it’s more like they’re bouncing off of each other. The interactions aren’t particularly conscious. It’s more like they’re each doing their own thing. They run into each other and it’s sort of like a pinball where their actions, thoughts and stories are mainly about themselves, but they bounce off each other and have an interaction. In particular, there’s a couple that I can see and am following - a white man with a mustache and shorter hair and with his partner/wife - I can’t tell what kind of relationship they’re in. The dad and the two daughters are in the mix now. I’m watching them. Now that the direction they’re going has now changed completely, he’s realizing they need clothes and supplies and food. They’re going around the train and getting some supplies. Everybody is pretty friendly and are like, “Yeah, we all don’t have a lot, but here I have this one coat or this shirt.” It seems like everybody on this train doesn’t have a lot of money, but they do have some resources. Everything they’re offering up has been well-used. But the daughters need clothes, shoes and food. And the dad’s like, yeah I could use a jacket. So everybody is offering what they’ve got. Then back to this one man with this woman. He’s wearing a flannel shirt that’s opened and jeans with rips. He knows what he’s wanting to do - he’s very focused. The train has now gone out from a tunnel to outside. I can see outside now. I’m in the train and outside the train, both simultaneously. I’m observing what’s happening in the train and outside of the train. So the train is outside and stops suddenly. Part of the tracks go through this person’s yard. Their yard looks like a big farm. The train dead stops in the middle. My thought when I see that is, “Ugh, how inconvenient to have a train in the middle of your front lawn. Then all the people start getting off the train. They’re milling about the lawn of this farm. It’s a big property. Then some of the people are going into the farmhouse and I’m watching them wondering, “Where’s the owner of this house? They're probably not going to like this.” Then that one man and the woman go into the house and they start looking for supplies. I see this other man, he’s a big beefy burly man, almost like a bodybuilder type guy. He’s with a woman, too, and she’s really big, maybe 200lbs and she has a backpack on. They see that the farmer has a horse that’s in the front lawn and they climb up on the horse to ride it. I’m like, “Oh my god, that horse’s back is going to break. That’s too much weight - bodybuilder, large woman plus backpack.” I see the horse walking, then trotting, then galloping. I’m like, “Oh my god!” The horse is fighting the whole time. The farmer comes out and yells at them to get off his horse, which is something I would have done. But the thought that registers in my brain is: “I can’t believe they know how to ride a horse.” With the whole bodybuilding persona, it doesn’t seem like something they would know how to do. Then I go back to the inside of this house where this other man is - the one with the mustache. He has found jewelry making supplies and he’s making jewelry. It’s gorgeous, raw stones and he’s soldering the silver. He’s making a pendant. It’s not his supplies, but the farmer’s that he found in this house. I can see this happening through a sliding glass door. Then I am inside the house. This black man and his daughters are in there, too, and they’re rummaging for food. The other people on the train are milling about, too, doing all kinds of things. The train has stopped because it’s stuck. But eventually, you hear the conductor yelling, “Hey, the train is back together. You need to get on. We’re going to go. We’re going to continue on.” So some of the people get back on the train, and some of the people are like, “No, we like it here. We’re going to stay here.” (not necessarily in the farmhouse, but in this area). The train continues on in its direction while another train passes in the opposite direction. I think the black man and his daughters get on the train going the opposite direction so they can get back to where they had originally set out to go to. Then the dream switches completely. Again I am an observer. I’m watching women I know - they are performers. It’s kind of like a circus. There’s a big tent. They’re in a dressing room in the back where everyone is talking. There’s lots of love and connection between all these women. They’re definitely family, they get along, some are actually blood family. It’s not a hierarchy because not just one person is in charge, but there is a synergy with one person who directs things. Things get done around her direction, but nobody has more or less power than her. This is fascinating for me to watch as she gives directions about how to do their show. It’s not actually directions. She’s asking who wants to do what - “Do you want to do this part of the show? Are we going to take a break?” Then there is an announcement that this man is coming in and he’s going to be a guest spot and do part of the show. I see all of the women perk up. Some are like, “Well, is he handsome?” But I see the woman who is the glue and directs things. She gets that look in her eye like, “Hmm, I don’t know if I trust this.” So everybody leaves the dressing room and goes out in the circus tent area where there’s definitely a crowd of people watching. They’re watching a show in a huge copper bathtub, big enough for multiple people to be in. The man comes in and he’s going to do his show in the bathtub. It reminds me of synchronized swimming and people who act like mermaids, so you can watch through the glass as they do this show under the water. So this man is doing all of it, but normally the show is done completely naked - all of the women are completely naked while they do it. He’s doing it with his clothes on and the women are wondering, “What is going on? Why is he doing it that way?” So the woman who directs and has some good mothering energy goes into the tub to do part of the show and she’s naked as usual. The man who has all of his clothes on has an assistant and she has all her clothes on, too. The woman that is directing things goes in and does her part. You can tell there is tension and this attempted shaming that she’s in there naked. It’s totally beautiful to watch her, but then there’s this man and this other woman who have their clothes. They look so weird, they can barely move because their clothes are dragging them down, especially in contrast to the woman who’s naked. Some of the other women come in and start doing the dance in the water and they’re naked. But then you see some sort of official come in and say, “You have to wear clothes now.” So they’re like, “Oh, we have to put our clothes on.” They do put their clothes on. The person who says, “you have to put your clothes on” is the husband of the woman who’s directing things. He says it because he says, “You can’t dance with that man naked,” because now in the show, they’re supposed to dance together. The husband of the woman who’s directing the show is feeling jealousy or protectiveness and he’s saying, “Don’t dance with him without your clothes on. You all put your clothes on.” So there’s this dynamic of men coming in and directing the woman and their dancing, nakedness, wildness and freeness.",Rose,last_nights_dream
444,1337,,06/04/2020,04/06/2020 00:05,"This dream begins with me standing inside my ex’s house. There’s a crowd of people in there looking around. It’s packed with people partying and I wonder, “Why am I here? I don’t want to be here?” I look and it’s like zombies, a sea of them, to try and get out the front door. While I'm strategizing how I’m going to leave, I notice there’s a baby in the crowd of people in the kitchen. No one is holding it. It’s just suspended or squished between people. It’s wearing a diaper and nothing else. I look around and find my ex and sya, “Do you know why that baby is there? Does that baby belong to anyone?” He says, “Yeah, I found it yesterday and brought it home.” I think to myself and am about to say, “Well, why aren’t you looking after it?” Then I realize, of course you're not looking after it, you brought it home to get attention, so people will think you’re a hero. But you’re not really looking after it. So I sigh and am resigned to thinking, “I’ll just sit here and watch to see if anyone is going to look after it before I leave.” Some time passes, an hour or two. The baby is crying. No one is looking after it. So I pluck it from the kitchen and I put it in my lap and soothe it. Then I look around to see if there’s anything I can possibly feed this child. I find my ex again and ask: “Do you have anything to feed the baby?” He says no. I say: “Do you have any diapers because it needs to be changed?” He says no. Then I’m holding the baby. I set it down on top of the kitchen table for a second. I’m scanning the room to see if I see any other women that look like they might possibly have something I can use for this baby. A young man, probably in his early twenties comes through the front door and into the kitchen but can’t get any farther because there’s too many people. He’s got a broom handle without the broom on the end and it has a white rubber end on it. He tucks it up under his arm and aims it at the baby as though he’s going to shoot it. He makes a fake shooting sound with his mouth. His face is in agony - it’s twisted up with grief. But then the baby starts crying again as if it’s been hit. I realize that a small tiny piece of white rubber has come off the end of the broom handle and hit the baby. I think, “Oh, my gosh! I didn’t realize that that was an actual shooting weapon or I would have picked the baby up to shield it.” So now I pick the baby up again because it’s crying and soothe it. I look and see a tiny mark on his leg, but it’s just red and it hasn't pierced the skin. Then I’m looking to see and wondering if this baby belongs to that young man. But he’s gone - he’s run out the front door again. So I’m back doing the same thing, trying to find something to change the baby and something to feed the baby. There’s water in the living room and it’s over my thighs. I’m disgusted that now this is on my body. I take the baby the way you would hold the baby over your shoulder and jostle it a little so it feels the rocking motion to soothe it. I notice there’s a big fish tank in the corner of the living room. So I wade over with the baby. My daughter’s there and she’s trying to feed the fish something because they’re rotten. As I get closer, I notice tiny white worms around the fish tank and I’m like “Ew!” I don’t want to risk these going inside my body or touching the baby. I look down to ask my daughter what she’s found to feed these fish with, but now she’s gone. So I wade away from the fish tank back towards the kitchen. Now I want to bathe the baby and I want to wash myself. But I can’t find anything in the cupboards - no soap, no towels. Everybody is still partying like mindless zombies. At this point, when I come out of the bathroom and back into the kitchen and living room, the water is gone. But I can still feel that disgusting kind of sogginess. The baby’s diaper has now absorbed this gross water. I think to myself, “Well, at least that will take some of the acidity away from its skin due to being full of pee.” There’s less people in the house now - they’ve started to thin out. My ex is standing and leaning against the mantel by his own fireplace. Then he lies down on his back on the floor as though he is going to go to sleep. There’s a couple of other people who are still there, though. At least two are women. I say to them, “Do you know anywhere I can find a diaper or some food to feed this baby?” They say, “There’s a Shoppers Drug Mart up the road.” They describe where it is and I realize it’s about 10 miles away and I don't have a car. I realize I came there on a bicycle and my bicycle is gone. I say to my ex, “Do you know what happened to my bicycle?” He says, “Yeah, that young man rode off on it.” I say, “Oh, I saw him. He tried to shoot the baby. Do you know who he is?” He says, “Yeah, he’s the baby’s older brother.” I ask, “Well is he coming back for the baby?” He shrugs his shoulders and says, “I don’t know.” So, then i ask the women, “Can either one of you drive me to the drugstore to get diapers and food for the baby?” One of them says, “Yes, I’ll take you there.” Then suddenly my ex says, “Oh, I’ll come with you.” I say to him, “Why do you want to go?” He says, “There’s a field beside the drugstore and I just want to go look at it.” So he says to the other woman that’s still there, “Why don’t you come, too?” She says, “Yes, okay.” So we’re just picking things up, the way you would look for your keys or pocketbook or something like that. I’ve got the baby on one hip, the soggy baby. Then I go back into the bathroom and think, “I could at least shower us off.” I’m still concerned about these white worms. So I think, “Well, why don’t I just shower us both off.”I’ll take the baby into the shower, we’ll put back our dirty clothes on after, but at least our bodies will be clean.” So I do that but without soap or anything. Then I come back out and am feeling a little bit better. The two women are still there and are finally ready to go. They’ve finished collecting what they need. As we stand up, now my ex stands and says, “Oh, by the way, can you guys look in this field beside Shoppers Drug Mart? There’s something I lost there yesterday.” I think, “Oh, here we go, that’s why he’s coming. He’s not helping. He just wants us to do something else for him.” He says, “Yes, it’s a small leather pouch with some grey dust in it that Joe gave me for doing a ceremony.” Although I didn't ask, my brain says, “Oh, Joe is a Native man and would be using it as pinch tobacco to thank the spirits. I wonder how my ex convinced Joe to give him that pouch and he’s lost it now in the field?”",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I am lying in the back of a car with my husband. The seats have been folded down so we can lie flat. He is naked. I am wearing a sweatshirt, leggings and shoes. They aren’t real leggings because my pelvis is bare. I’m offering my body, but still holding back with reluctance. There is a coldness about him, his body saying, “Nope, I’m done.” I feel fear, despair, total abandonment come over my whole body. In another scene I’m walking into a building with Jack. He is in waking life and in this dream, a relationship counselor. We walk in and look through the window of a door into a classroom. I see three men on yoga mats and a fourth teaching. In the next room, my husband is co-teaching with our friend, Sherry. There is a big group of people doing a practice involving rubbing their knuckles along their foreheads. I’m surprised there are so many people when they were only expecting a few. Jack tells me that the group next door was supposed to have a bigger class, but cut back to only 4, so the remaining people decided to take class with my husband and Sherry. It’s good to see my husband doing his thing and having success in his role as a teacher. Then in another scene, I’m at a wedding ceremony or vow renewal for my husband and me. When it comes time for me to kiss my husband again, he has a basket of papers and a basket of flowers. Other people are around. He pretends to draw me in, but rejects me, turning away at the time of the kiss. There is a sense that I’ve done something horribly wrong and he’s gone now.

I can see all the buildings, trees and landscape I’m familiar with. Then, the next thing I remember is that I’m at a party/celebration/gathering. All the old high school classmates are there. Somebody asks me for a drink. I’m standing at a counter that has a sink in it and the top is a butcher block that can be used as a cutting board. I turn around and reach up to this top shelf that’s in a cabinet behind me. I grab a bottle of whiskey and a shot glass. I pour a shot of whiskey for this person. I’m totally grossed out because I don’t drink and whiskey is the worst. I hand it to my friend, Ikaika. He tosses it back and puts the shot glass down. I can smell the whiskey and it’s burning my nose. He says something to me, but I’m not sure what it is. I just have the sense that I am totally included in the party. I'm not just the help making drinks. I just happen to be standing close to the liquor cabinet. I’m one of the people who knows how to make cocktails, so that’s what I’m doing. I’m now with a friend of mine, Josh, and another friend, Chris - it’s both of them combined into one body. This person’s body is totally banging - holy crap - if that could happen in real life! We’re hanging out together in a home. There’s one part where he’s just gotten out of the shower and has a towel wrapped around his waist and we’re in conversation. Then something happens and I see him through a door with a big glass window in it. He’s in a greenhouse with a plastic corrugated roof over the top. I can tell it’s a warm space. There are plants everywhere and also a treadmill. He’s covered in soap - like when you go in a carwash and the car is covered in soap with big bubbles. He has goggles on so he doesn’t get soap in his eyes. I think he’s naked. He’s asking me to hose him off. I’m doing it from the other side of the glass window somehow. There’s a glass partition between us. So I spray him down a little, then I see him go to the treadmill and start to run on it. He’s all soapy and I’m spraying water on him, but thinking this is not very safe, it’s not a good idea. But I spray him off and he says thank you. Then I come out of this dream completely and am in a more lucid time. I hear one of my guides say, “You’re almost out of it. It’s almost over. There is one more big shock, then it’s almost over.” I hear this and in my head, I can see...you know when you break down a cardboard cereal box and it folds at the bottom where the panels are...I’m breaking down a cereal box while I hear this in my head.

On his plate was a large square of corn somewhere between 4 and 8 inches in each direction. As we were eating, the corn formed a face and began to speak to us. It asked us some strange questions, which we answered, but then it asked us, ""Do you like Pythagoras?"" At this point we realized that it was demonic and decided that we had to destroy it. I took a spoon (or maybe my hand) and smashed it into pieces which scattered across the floor.   After this, I spoke to my dad about the danger of both angels and demons.

Somehow, the entire landscape around Grandpa P.'s house--the topography and every contour--was meaningful laid out and contained some sort of hidden truth. I had just realized this and was trying to explain the idea to my dad. It was something that I realized Grandpa P. had written in his book. I knew my dad would think this was nonsense even as I began to articulate the idea.

455,1886,,07/04/2020,04/07/2020 00:10,"My father was a scientist who had traveled to another planet to do research. Back at home, I was riding a go-kart around the woods where I lived. The go-kart was partly powered by an engine and partly by pedal. When you pedaled, the go-kart engine would engage and help you out, but it was still the case that the harder you pedaled the faster you would go, so if you wanted to really zip you had to put forth some effort. I was in the woods by the park and climbing up the dunes that are by the old lake bed. I had to pedal hard to get up the sides of the dunes without slipping back down. When I had gotten to the top (maybe?) I found myself in a completely alien world. It was a massive expanse of desert where the sandy clay substrate was a dull reddish orange--the color of clay.   There was no sign of flora or fauna, but I could see my dad in the distance working with one or two fellow researchers. They didn't seem particularly surprised to see me. When I was within a stones-throw away, I got out and began walking closer. There were baseballs lying around and it was clear that a game of catch had been underway. I picked up one of the balls and attempted to throw it to one of my dad's friends. It completely missed its target as the gravity on the planet was not that of earth. I believe it was significantly less as one of the balls thrown went much higher than expected.   This dream felt spiritually significant and there was something not just ""alien"" about the planet. The feeling that I've had that heaven is right around the corner is similar to the feeling I had in this dream when I came to the top of an ordinary hill and found myself in another world.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

I remember it being fall as there were leaves on the ground and there was not much greenery to be seen. It was late afternoon or early evening and the lighting was a bit dim. I hiked for a good ways, came to a good stopping point, and turned around. I hiked back to a gap or clearing where I had left my bike locked to a tree. The bike was a dull orange. As I bent down to unlock it, another hiker came up from the opposite direction and seemed to think that I was stealing the bicycle. He didn't say anything, but I was sure he thought I was taking it. I fumbled slightly with the lock, but managed to unlock it. I began riding the bike out of the clearing. The trail began to rise and ahead of me I saw that some kids were running toward me. I pulled my bike off to the side of the trail to let them past. One of them ran past, and I saw his dad and brother ahead. The first boy either had a water bottle, or had dropped one and was retrieving it. I smiled at them and was overjoyed to see a family out enjoying the outdoors together. I spoke briefly with the father and then kept on my way. I got to the end of my journey and called an Uber to pick me up. He showed up in a shiny black sedan. He was also black. When I got into the backseat of the car, he told me that the ride was going to cost $2,000. I was shocked and we both agreed that it must be a mistake. He told me that he'd correct it. We drove off onto a highway, taking an exit numbered 5. We were in a large, grey, metallic city. It was not a happy place.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

The house had belonged to Grandpa P. before his death. It was sunny and warm, though there the trees around the clearing provided more shade than usual because of how close together they were growing and their dense foliage. Many of the trees were dead, and while I wanted to live in this house, my parents told me on the phone (as I had called them on my cell-phone) that it wouldn't be safe to live there. I was looking up at the canopy trying to determine if it would be safe enough. I thought I might be able to clear out some of the deader trees.   Entering the yard of the house, it was a bit like the outside of an amusement park. There was a gate where we entered and had to be registered. There were rides in side and a expanses of concrete ground. It was still a house though, with rooms containing the rides and normal white plaster walls.   Outside in the yard there was a pen in which was our old rabbit Lopsy. I was in the cage and trying to pet her. There were a lot of places where she could easily escape the cage and we assumed she wasn't really being confined.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

This time I’m afraid she’ll know I’ve been here and there will be hell to pay. Natasha is in the room with a male therapist and my husband. They have all done some very deep emotional work of some kind and are passed out on the bed. I don’t sense anything sexual, though. I rush in to tell them that we must go now! They’re too slow to rise and I keep urging them on, trying to convey the sense of urgency. They slowly start to pack up their bags. At first they just have a couple small bags, but as they pack, it seems more suitcases and piles of clothes accumulate. I’m really getting worried and panicked. The suitcases are overflowing with clothes and not closed. There are drying racks full of clothes. There’s no way we’ll get out this time without her (Ursula) knowing we’ve been here. I’m terrified at the possible repercussions. In another scene, I am in a small conference room of a hotel with sliding glass doors. My son is with me. Other people are there, too. I’m needing to teach a yoga class over Zoom, so I’m pulling up the class on my phone, wearing my headphones, trying to teach to the people on the screen, and chasing after my son. Some people are doing yoga, others are on the beach hanging out, others are in their home or driving their car. It’s quite unmanageable, but somehow I keep teaching. My son escapes and jumps into the pool. He’s having a great time splashing about and the people in the pool are watching us both. There’s something about shoes later on, but I can’t recall. Another scene: I am in a cafeteria and it is crowded. I’m with two men and am attracted to them both, but we cannot hear each other speak.

461,1139,,08/04/2020,04/08/2020 00:03,"I’m watching these two men. There's been a gathering of Native Hawaiians and they were all making lei for each other. It’s beautiful. But now I’m watching this man I know, Stan - he was an upperclassman for a few years when I was in school and he had a twin brother. He’s standing in front of a huge loom, the size of a garage door. There’s this other man who is a stranger to the culture, not raised in Hawaii, but he really wants to know how to weave this loom with flowers. It’s kind of like he’s trying to learn the native ways. I’d say these men are both in their late 20s, early 30s. So this man that’s trying to learn, he’s a stranger to me in the dream, he has picked a flower - it’s a gorgeous purple flower with maybe 5 petals that are long and spiky and the stamin in the center are also long and really skinny and you can see the pollen at the tips. He’s trying to weave this entire loom with these purple flowers. He’s doing okay under the instruction of Stan. I’m feeling frustrated watching him because that’s not a flower that Native Hawaiians ever wove with or made lei with. So I’m like this guy doesn’t get it - he doesn’t understand the meaning of each flower that the Hawaiians would use. But he’s gotten most of the door woven. He keeps messing up. I go to try to help him complete it. Parts of what he’s woven falling off the frame. I’m trying to help him keep it taut. I started out observing, but now I’m part of the dream. I’m trying to show him how and the other guy is trying to show him how, too. He doesn’t get it. There’s a part of me that’s like, “This guy is a little bit mental, he’s slow on the uptake, he’s not understanding how to do this.” Then Stan suddenly turns into a black cat and is so affectionate with me. This is funny because cats are not always affectionate. But as a cat, he’s super affectionate with me and I can feel he’s still waiting for this other guy to complete the weaving. This woman shows up, her name is Audrey (she plays the guitar and she’s an incredible musician). She is trying to give more pointers to the guy doing the weaving, but also mentioning: “Oh my gosh, I’ve never seen him do that as a cat. I’ve never seen him rub up on somebody so much and be in your lap and try to be so affectionate.” I am a little bit curious about this. It seems like the cat wants to be turned back into Stan, but I’m not entirely sure what he needs, except for that the weaving needs to be finished. The woman does tell the other guy who has been doing the weaving: “Just so you know, we don’t use that flower for that and that’s why the spell is not going right. Then the weaving is finished and we leave it where it is hanging in this loom over a garage. Audrey is showing me some rings that she has. This whole time the black cat is on me and with me. She has pulled down this tupperware container from a shelf above the garage door. There are all these rings in it that are all gold. She says: “You need to take a ring, this is what the cat is trying to tell you.” She shows me one of the rings she’s wearing from the container. It’s pure gold and really thick, and segmented like those watches you can slip on because they’re elastic. I’m like, “Okay I’ll find one.” I’m digging through and looking for a silver one, but there aren’t any silver ones. I’m a little bummed because I want a silver one, not a gold one like the one she has on. In this same plastic container, there’s underwear and sports bras. She’s saying, “These are ones that I used to have, but I’m giving them away, if there’s anything in here that you would like.” I’m going through it and there’s nothing I like. They’re the wrong colors or the wrong style. So I leave it. Then the dream shifts. My friend Aila, who is part Native American, shows up in the dream with Audrey. We leave this garage area and walk out to her porch. Her kids are with us. But her son is sick - he’s not feeling well. We're all supposed to be getting in a car to go somewhere. We walk out the garage and we’re on a smaller porch. We’re looking out across a lot of land with cattle in the background, and to the right, a low and long building with corrugated roofing on the side that slants up - like half of a manufactured home. There’s also a pack of dogs, almost 10 of them. We’re sitting on the porch and it’s time for us to leave. Aila tells her kids to go get in the car, but her son is sick and they both go, but I’m like: “I don’t know if he should be going with us. He’s not well. He could get something and get more sick. Or he could get other people sick.” Aila is sitting in a big wicker chair with a big round back - it’s her porch furniture. She takes her binoculars. We’re discussing whether or not her son should go. She says, “Oh my god, every time I’m in a crisis point, or something like this happens, this dog always shows up. It’s name is Baxter.” So she’s looking through her binoculars and I look to the pack of dogs. The dogs are all different - big and small, all different colors and breeds. Sure enough, there's this dog that wasn’t there before. It has a bandana around its neck. I think that’s the one she’s talking about, but I don’t know because there are 10 different dogs and I haven’t seen any of them before. It seems very significant to her that this dog shows up any time something like this happens.",Rose,last_nights_dream
462,1339,,08/04/2020,04/08/2020 00:04,"“The Plant Hanger” It’s something like a conference, but more like a festival. I don’t know many people in it and I feel lost. I’m grateful to see that my sister-in-law is there, so we group together. She accompanies me as I move from place to place among the throngs of people. When it’s over, we stop somewhere and pick up some kind of plant. Then, I meet my friend, Michelle. She invites me back to her apartment. But my sister-in-law doesn’t come. She says she has somewhere else to go. The apartment is located on the upper floor, above a store. It’s on a very busy street in a city. I’ve been in this city before in a dream - this is the street where I saw my grandmother coming out of one of the shops. We go up the stairs to the side of the shop entrance and down a very small hall into her apartment. The kitchen is off to the left, the living/dining room is straight ahead, like an L-shaped room around the kitchen, and off to the left is the bathroom and two bedrooms. We sit down on the couch in the living room for a few moments. Her young son is there. I’ve never seen him in person before. I’m watching him play. Then, Michelle says to me: would I take a look at her plant window and help her to move all the plants in front of that window and get them hung in that place because they’re dying. So we go down to the bedroom and she shows me the window. The light that is shining through is radiant and it dazzles my eyes. I can’t even look at the window because the light is so bright. So I stand to the side of it and turn my head toward it and look that way. I see that there’s actually a sheer curtain hanging from a rod in front of the window. I didn’t notice it before because the light coming through was so dazzling. There are two plants hanging from the curtain rod. The ceiling is really high. While I’m looking at this and strategizing and thinking, hmm, how are we going to do this, she comes in and has this big vase, about 2 feet long and with mosaic on it. The colors are brilliant, mostly purple with some black, but the paint is peeling. She said: “I wonder about putting this in here, too.” As soon as she sets it down, there's some kind of reaction with the light coming through the window. All of a sudden you can see a whole lot more detail in the painting on it. But because the light is so brilliant, you can’t tell it was cracked before. I say, “Oh yes, definitely bring that in here and put it in front of the window.” As she did that, everything else in the room lit up with an internal radiance of its own. So I say to her: “That is one really high ceiling and I can’t imagine your husband having to put 16 plant hooks in the ceiling. Do you even have a ladder? So it might be better to just put 2 hooks in and we’ll hang 2 wooden dowels across, then hang the plants from those. We can stagger them. I’ve done this before in my own place.” So she agrees, then needs to go back to tend her son. So I take some measurements. Now I have in my bag, big spools of twine that I’m going to cut and start weaving into plant hangers, like macrame. So I go back out into the living room after taking the measurements and she says: “Why don’t you have tea first? I’ve made some homemade cookies.” I do that and again we’re watching her son play. We can't really have a conversation because every time we start one, her son comes up with a toy and starts talking and suspends the conversation. Then she asks if I’ll watch him while she goes into the washroom. I say, “Sure.” So I’m talking to him and lying on the floor. He’s moving trucks around or something. He hands me this toy and I notice that it’s got a plunger on the inside that you pull out then push - like a big plastic version of a gun. It was red and yellow with all these other floating pieces of color on the inside. I accidentally push the plunger and it squirts him in the eye with water. He lies down on the floor as though I’ve hit him. I understand that I’ve accidentally started playing with him with this squirt thing and I didn’t mean to squirt water in their house. So I get up and put it on the counter in the kitchen. While I’m doing this, Michelle comes out of the bathroom and she picks her son up and puts him on her hip and follows me into the kitchen. She’s doing something with one hand while she’s holding him with the other. I notice that there’s so much noise. I look over and see that there’s two televisions on and they’re both playing something different. I ask her if I can turn one of them off. She says yes, so I do. Then she says, “While you’re there, turn the other one off, too.” I look at it and don’t understand how. There’s a labyrinth of buttons and I don't see anything that’s obvious with a power switch. She says it’s the fourth one down from the top. So I push it, but the buttons are really small and my fingers are big. I accidentally push the second button first, and the television reacts and some other things happen simultaneously. She sighs, exasperatedly and comes over and turns it off herself. She sets her son down on the floor in the living room again with the toys, and says, “I need to go back in the bathroom again.” So I sit down with him. While I’m doing this, her husband comes in. I’ve never met him before. He’s surprised to see me. He sets down his suitcases, then asks if I know where the cookies are. I say, “Yes, they’re in the kitchen.” So he goes in there. His son is still playing, but now he’s making utterances and they’re really deep. I notice that he has a really deep voice. I’m trying to decipher what he’s saying. Now the dad is in the kitchen and he’s talking. I can’t understand what he’s saying, but I notice that his voice is deep, too, and think to myself: “Oh, that’s where the son gets his deep voice from.” Then Michelle comes out of the bathroom and she goes into the kitchen to talk to her husband and says something about there being three different kinds of cookies. She’s trying to get him to take one certain kind, but he’s ignoring her and piling up a plate of three different kinds and starts to eat them. Now I’m feeling uncomfortable because I’m in their family dynamic and I don’t wish to be. I just want to make the macrame hangers for the plants. That’s when I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream1
463,1340,,08/04/2020,04/08/2020 00:05,"“Grey Stone Staircase” I’m outside. The landscape is not a river, but a stream, maybe 50 yards wide. There’s a bridge over top that's made of grey stone and cement. The part you would walk over is no longer there, only the foundation is there. The grey stone part of the bridge spreads down the banks of the stream on either side of it, as well as going down and up the stream. It’s really, really high. There are stairs carved out of the stone. When you climb up to the top, you can see the air - it’s whipping around. I can feel my hair whipping across my face. The mist from the river is mixed in with this air, so my hair quickly turns into small ropes and is slapping against my skin. My clothes are slapping against my legs. Looking down creates this really strong sense of vertigo. I’ve been told to climb up here, yet the stairs aren’t safe. Once you get up to the top, you walk a little bit and look straight down. There are vertical steps - so not stairs on an incline, but vertical, which is really dangerous, especially in this kind of wind. The water current is one big current and it looks like it’s muddy and murky because it moves so fast all the time, so all of this stuff from the bottom of the river is stirred up, so you can’t see through it at all. There’s other bits of debris, like logs and twigs and other natural items from the earth. I can see a few people way down there. They're just looking at the stairs but not moving. I’m supposed to climb back down these vertical stairs. I’m trying, but at this point, my son comes into my room and shouts at me.

Aila is trying to organize a ritual and gathering. She’s trying to gather the people to do ritual. She’s also trying to gather the people in protest. The gathering is happening on a train. We are all getting on this train. The train has a destination, but I’m not sure where. There are men and women. We are gathering in a town and we’re trying to gather because the powers that be - those in charge of the town - are actively trying to suppress us, suppress our rights. I just have the sense of them being the bad guy - and it’s men. We’re all on this train and there are police officers who are trying to interfere and interrupt. Aila’s kids are with her. Mine are not, but I know where they are. Along with the other townspeople, there are also a bunch of younger men who are teenagers or early twenties. We’re on the train and gathering for the ritual, but it’s taking a really long time to start. As I watch, the younger men get off the train. They are not there to support. Their excuse is that they have to go to their practices for their organized sports, whatever that is. I’m watching and I see Aila’s partner Austin who is this very tall cowboy with the boots, the hat, the buckle. He gets off the train to go rather these younger men who are basically deserting. They are deserting their wives, girlfriends, mothers and even fathers - the older grey beards - who are on the train. Aila is still preparing for ritual for all of us to take part in. But Austin leaves to go get these younger men. I leave because I realize my kids are not with me and I want to go get my kids - it’s really important that they be part of this. Both Austin and I are headed in the same direction, but are not going for the same reasons. We exchange a few words. We head towards a lagoon in the ocean. I’m facing the lagoon and to my right is a break wall - it’s just a stone break wall with cement poured over the top so you can walk to the end of it. On the far side of the break wall is the wild, wild ocean - it’s totally untamed. The waves are huge and it's windy. Then on the other side of this break wall is this lagoon with a glassy surface and you can see down towards the bottom and you can see the animal life growing in it. The lagoon has another boundary. It’s not quite a break wall because it doesn’t break the surface of the ocean, but is maybe a reef or manmade. It creates a curve. Actually the whole lagoon is a circle because the break wall on one side is curved and this wall underneath the water is also curved. My kids are there. I can see my daughter and son are playing in the lagoon - the safe side. I’m watching as Austin walks down the break wall on the wild side. He dives into that wild ocean and I watch him swim out to a rock that makes it relatively shallow. He stands up on the rock. He’s having this moment with the sun shining down and illuminating him, and the water is glistening off his skin. Austin in waking life is a very tall, thin person, but in the dream he has all these muscles. He comes back to gather the young man. In this lagoon, my daughter is playing with one of my hula sisters from when I was younger. She was younger than me at the time. They’re playing together and you can see that my daughter is white, white, white and my hula sister is mostly Filipino - so you can see the super blond hair and the dark hair. My son is also playing in the water. I’m making sure they’re both safe and not going too deep. I have this feeling of being very protective of both of them in terms of whether they can swim or not. It’s okay that they’re playing. I don’t have any concerns about who they’re playing with. I think that because I’m watching an interaction happen between my daughter and my old hula sister. They’re definitely working something out. I’m not concerned about that part at all. I’m just concerned that both children don’t drown. I’m also watching Austin trying to gather up some of these men. Some of the young men who left the train are here at this lagoon. They're not at the practice like they said they would be. They’re actually jumping off the lower submerged wall. One section of it has a structure built on top of it that looks like a carnival booth and they’re jumping off the front of it into this lagoon. They’re having a grand old time, but definitely not doing what they said they needed to do, which was go to practice, and they’re definitely not supporting everybody on the train. I’m watching this happen and by this time I’ve swam out to the center of the lagoon and am standing on one of those rocks that lifts you up out of the ocean. I’m watching these young boys and have feelings of disgust because of their choices. Then I turn to look back at the entrance of the lagoon and I see Aila come down. She looks so weary and grief stricken and tired and exhausted and sad. I’m concerned and don’t know what’s going on. She says, “The train was raided by these police officers.” I’m seeing police officers with those helmets with the shield and the bat. She says it was raided and they kicked everybody off the train and they did not let us practice and we never got to the ritual. I had seen her start to light a candle and she had her feather and was smudging. She says, “We didn’t get to it. We weren’t allowed to gather. The police broke us up.” I can feel the frustration and oppressive nature of this event happening and also her exhaustion and grief. I feel feelings of guilt because I wasn’t there to protest against it. She is saying how they tried to arrest her and they arrested so many people. I have these conflicting emotions because I am completely furious and boiling the water around me, and also guilt because I wasn’t there - I had gone to go find my children because the ritual was taking so long and I was concerned about them. I notice that she wants her children and her children are with her. She’s hugging them. Her attention is just on Austin and her children. And even though we are the best of friends, she’s sort of shut me out. I can feel it. It feels hurtful and also at the same time, I am completely understanding because it’s the thing that she’s always working towards - some sense of equality. To be able to bring a community together in ritual like that and to have it shut down by the man is just exhausting. The dream ends there with me feeling pretty shitty.",Rose,last_nights_dream
471,1341,,09/04/2020,04/09/2020 00:07,"“Macro-Level Choices” This dream begins where I am part of this diagram, so I’m watching what feels like a macro-level perspective of different groups of people’s food choices. What I see with my eyes is a big bluish grey, but not a chart...it’s like I’m inside the chart. I realize I'm looking at patterns of people at an anthropological level from around the world and the choices that they make in food. I’m watching them like small dots. I’m wondering what this is. I look at them and study them for long enough. They’re moving. I see almost like an arc, a pendulum, that swings from the cluster of dots of choices they make, and I’m not even sure that they’re all food related - I don’t think they are. They’re clustering. Then one of the dots will swing out like a pendulum, then pause. It’s moved into this other category of things that they’ve learned. The learning is an evolutionary succession. In the dream, I seem to understand the macro-level implications of this without needing to know the exact words or categories of each choice. My thinking brain is in wonderment at realizing what all these small clusters of activity arrive at - like an aha! Then I move from realizing that some of them are food choices. The dreams shifts from a macro-level to what is happening right now on the earth. Then I arrive in a restaurant. I’m looking at people’s food choices. It starts at a table with a woman I haven’t seen in a long time - Margie is one of my daughter’s friend’s mothers. I haven’t seen her since my daughter was in Grade 8 because the kids ended up going to different high schools. Margie sits down and makes some kind of comment like, “I thought we were friends, but you never contacted.” I express surprise at this and say, “Yes, I live over here now and work every evening as well as in the day. I don’t have time for that kind of thing.” She seems to feel amenable to that explanation and starts talking to me about her family. As she’s talking, this other young lad, maybe 17, is hovering around the table and moving things. He’s getting his backpack and he’s putting things in it. Then he slides into the role of server and is cleaning some of the plates away. Only Margie’s daughter’s plate is left. Now I’m thinking he’s some kind of older step brother and wonder if she has remarried since I knew her. But I look at the young man and he has some features that look like Margie’s husband. So now I’m wondering if this young man is maybe a child of the previous marriage of the husband, which means they could still be together and I’m just seeing this man grown up. Then the scene shifts from the table in a restaurant. I’m now in the kitchen in their house. People are packing up and clearing away dishes from the table, still. Margie has asked me if I’ll come over for tea. I agree to do this. My own son has somehow been invited to go back and forth from my house to hers, which is actually something she would do - organize families on this slightly macro-level as dinner is going on because she is an accountant. He’s now only 7 and he has a scooter. There's the question of how he will get his things from my house to hers on this scooter. I tell him to try it right now: “Put all the things you have with you in a bag and we’ll weigh it. Is it too heavy to swing from one handle of the scooter?” It is. It will pull him off balance a bit. So I say, “Why don’t we roll the bag and I’ll bungee cord it to the back of the scooter. No one uses that space anyway. Then it will keep the mechanics more balanced.” Margie says, “Oh yes! That’s a really good idea!” My son is now on the road and he gives it a couple tries up and down and says, “Yes, it works.” Now I'm back in the kitchen - in the thought of the kitchen. The dream is shifting me through thought patterns. The young man is now ready to go and he hasn’t said anything I ask him if he needs a ride because he seems to be hovering. I ask him how he’s going to move from Place A to Place B. He declines the ride. Now, the dream pattern shifts and I’m in a restaurant and serving tables, moving food from underneath the heat lamp where it’s cooked in the kitchen out to the tables - I’m coordinating that. It tells you where to go because it has the name of the server on the paper beside the food as well as the table number. So I just do this for a little bit. Then my shift is over and I’m sitting in the breakroom counting up money and adding that up when one of the cooks comes in from the kitchen and says, “So what are you going to do now?” I realize I’m not on the schedule for next week and the rest of the staff seem to know this and are questioning why this has happened. Each person, there’s probably 5 or 6 people who come into contact with me and tell me they’re surprised by this, and that I was doing a new job, and they are sorry to see me go, and then some questions about how they’ll keep in touch with me. I’m wondering, thinking, “Oh so it’s not just me not knowing why I’ve been let go.” I decide after all of this to go into the office to see if I can ask why. I’m looking for closure. The part of the administration that’s responsible for scheduling doesn’t know the answer to that question and evades me when I ask direct questions, but doesn’t seem hostile. There’s the energy of feeling that person doesn’t know why they’ve been requested to do that either. So, I leave, put everything in my pack, make sure I’ve left nothing behind, and say final goodbyes. And here’s this young man again from the other thought pattern - the guy that might possibly be Margie’s stepson. He’s leaving at the same time, but now he’s asking me if I need a ride. I say, “No thank you. I’ve got a car in the parking lot.” So I walk out with my things and put them in the car. I notice he’s putting his things in a red car. When he leaves, it’s really noisy. Then I get in mine. Now there’s snow on the ground. I’m testing my brakes. The brakes aren’t where they should be. So I gear down to navigate my car out of the parking lot because I have to make a right hand turn. Gearing down works and gives me a little extra time to figure out where the brake pedal has been moved to. It’s weight over on the left in a really odd place, where the clutch would be. But I’ve got it now. I have to make another right hand turn. Suddenly there’s a bus. The whole left hand lane is stopped, so I go even further left to go around. It’s okay even though my tires don’t really have traction in the snow. Now I'm driving through a city. I start job hunting. I stop at a few restaurants on my way home after applying to three different restaurants. They all say they don’t need anyone. Now I’ve driven to the complete opposite end of town and am back in the house where I would meet Margie for tea.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

We went shopping and I was struck by a display of black wide legged pants and suspender-like things with unique designs up over the torso and shoulders and neck. Some had white shirts underneath as part of the outfit, but I was drawn to a dark striped black and burgundy one. The mannequins were facing up with chins up. There was an emotion attached to this outfit like when I saw it it meant something - a sentiment that was uplifting. (and in real life I’m about the farthest thing from a fashionista). When I went to try it on, they didn’t have my size so I just got the pants but I wanted the top so much that I left and returned later, but they still didn’t have it.

One involves a plastic Easter egg. My husband and I have parked the car on the side of a street. We’re going to a restaurant. My son is in his carseat. We get out and open his door, but leave him. We get the stroller out of the back. But for some reason we can’t take him and the stroller at the same time. So we decide to leave him in the car with the door open and take the stroller first. We think the restaurant is just up the street. As we are walking down the sidewalk, I keep looking back over my shoulder to see if it’s okay to leave him in the car. Then we keep walking and walking until the car is out of sight - the restaurant is further than we thought. We finally see the outdoor stairs across the street. So we go cross the street and go through the gate. We see a nook for the stroller. But now we are concerned that someone will come steal the stroller if we leave it to go back and get T. So we pull it just inside the gate leading to the stairs to the restaurant. I see that we can lock the stroller with a big caribenier and the smaller caribenier or our car keys. So we somehow lock it up to the gate. It’s taking a long time. While we are doing this, families come in and go up the stairs. We follow them up to get reservations and a table because we are concerned there won’t be a table by the time we get back with T. Someone asks if we need to make a phone call about our child. We tell them no. They say we can make four calls on our insurance. We look at each other and are worried we left him, but insist we are okay because we don’t want to reveal that we’ve left him in the car by himself. But we are concerned he may no longer be there. But we don’t rush back. We are looking at prepared foods behind the glass refrigerator doors. We see chicken, curries, fermented foods and such in plastic containers. They aren’t nicely prepared, though. A lot of time is passing.",Ana,last_nights_dream
478,1141,,10/04/2020,04/10/2020 00:06,"It’s twilight feeling. I’m observing a couple of people - two men who I have a feeling of affinity or affection for, or maybe there is a familial tie. There’s a young girl that we are responsible for, or taking care of. I don’t know if she’s a daughter or younger sister, but she’s important and it’s imperative that we keep her safe. There’s a gathering of people. We’re trying to find her a coat to keep her warm. We set her up so she’s in one spot and she gets her coat. She’s trying on coats. We are outdoors and it’s cold. We snag a coat from a rack of coats. There’s something so special about this girl. She has a light shining from the inside. Everything around us is twilight and dull looking and dirty, but she’s not that. She’s a brighter light. So we get her this coat and make sure she’s warm. One of the men feels like she’s adequately protected in this little area that she’s in. So he leaves her for a second so she can get a sense of autonomy. He and the other man - I think they are brothers - are closeby. But they don’t exactly have their eyes on her because she disappears and they start to panic. Someone tells them that the last time they saw her, she was in a shop with pretty clothes. It’s an old-fashioned shop - Victorian Era - with all the details on the outside of the building and large ceilings. It’s definitely a high-end shop from that period. I go inside and am observing as the brothers go inside where these people last saw the girl. They’re interviewing the shopkeeper. She’s a woman who only speaks French and she’s got very well-tailored bespoke clothing on, old fashioned jewelry that looks like costume jewelry, but is real - huge oval-shaped diamond earrings with emeralds all the way around. The place itself exudes high class sophistication. This is where the young girl was last seen because the front room of the shop - the showing area - is windows from floor to ceiling and it’s also an alcove that juts out into the street so that people can see what’s being sold in the shop. If you see the mannequins in the front, you can look past and see these tall mirrors where people can look at themselves where they try on clothes. But it’s all on display so people walking by can see in. So definitely, there’s a sense of expensiveness being on display or shown - if you can go in that shop, then clearly you have money. So the men go in and ask the proprietor about the young girl. I can see that the young girl had been there and the woman had shown her a few pretty dresses, But the young girl’s interest was in a pair of earrings that were really stones, very shiny and rather big, even though the young girl didn’t have her ears pierced. The woman says she gave the earrings to the girl.Then the girl comes out from somewhere in the store. The men are relieved that she’s there. They bundle her up and take her away. I can tell that was a doppelganger - that wasn’t the real girl. As I watch the men leave, I look at the proprietor's face and has this weird smug look. I’m like, “Oh no. That was not it. She’s got this girl somewhere and she’s doing something to her.” So the woman who owns the shop leaves the front area and heads through a door and down some back stairs to a basement. I’m following her. Again, she doesn’t know I’m there, so I’m still just observing. We get down to the bottom of the stairs. It’s a production area where the clothes are sewn. She has a lot of young women working for her. The conditions look okay, but there’s definitely this air of her being in charge and they’re working for her. Things look pretty clean, but I get the sense she’s not paying them very much, if at all. They’re filling the role of slave. This is the part in the dream where I start to poke around because I have the feeling that she has that young girl locked up somewhere down in this basement area. There’s one door for me to look through. But the dream ends, because I never find the girl. I’m left with the sense that the girl is down in the basement in some kind of dungeon room or closet. She’s locked up and this woman is evil.",Rose,last_nights_dream
479,1342,,10/04/2020,04/10/2020 00:07,"“The Arms Dealer” This dream setting is a busy small town, disproportionately overrun with criminals and crime rings for the size of its population. My consciousness has filtered down and is inhabiting a man who is involved in explosives. So my consciousness is inside this man who is in a store. It appears to be a bookstore that sells other sundry items. But his contact is the employee who works in the store. So he’s not there to buy books. I realize I’m not in my own body because I see my arm and it’s a man arm with a man hand. I look at my chest and am wearing a leather jacket that’s not mine. So I hand the store employee a piece of paper and it has three ingredients on it that my own consciousness suddenly recognizes as a recipe for gunpowder. Phosphorus. I can’t see the other two names, but that’s what I think. Then, he talks to the man behind the counter and sets a meetup time where they are also supposed to put their gunpowder in a warehouse that’s going to be picked up by someone else that night. That’s the point I realize they’ve both been hired by someone else to do this. Then the man exits teh bookstore door. He goes out. He turns right, goes one storefront down the street, and the building says, Scotts Decorating, but it has round cafe tables out in front. He sits down with his other two buddies and shares what he’s done at the bookstore and the meetup time tonight, and says, “Okay, does everybody have it clear what their roles are?” They nod and agree. Then I notice I have this dry cough. One of them says, “Eh, shouldn’t you bow out of this because of your cough? Aren’t we not supposed to jostle this material or there’s the danger of it exploding?” Man consciousness me says, “No, it’s okay. It’ll be fine.” The part of my own consciousness that’s trapped in there says, “You have to be kidding! Why are you in denial of this? You can’t have any cough. It’s not supposed to be jostled once.” I feel frustrated inside this guy’s consciousness. Then, he has a few things that he’s gathered and puts his arms around them and carries them. It feels like the way it would feel as though you were carrying two bags of groceries with loaves of bread in them with one tucked under each arm. I compare it to this. Then he walks up the alleyway and into his house. I notice that the house is really overcrowded and has toys and books and stuff everywhere - belonging to someone who never cleans up. Then he goes into the kitchen and the rack they use in restaurants for putting dishes on and then putting them through an autoclave machine - he sets three loaves of bread on the dish rack and puts them in the oven, but doesn’t turn it on yet. He’s still got this dry cough, and I think, “Wow, isn’t this guy going to take care of that?” But he doesn’t. Then he sits down at the table, ostensibly to wait while these things do whatever they have to do in the oven. Then the part of the man that’s my consciousness starts to take over and the man consciousness starts to go away. Now I’m me and I’m sitting there looking around at this mess and thinking, “Ugh, I have to start cleaning this up.” Then across from the table, Omar appears. I tell him, “What is wrong with these people? Why is everybody in denial? There's so many other choices that people make. I don’t get it.” He nods his head and agrees, then asks me if it’s okay if he uses my bicycle from the garage. I say, “Yeah, do you know which one it is?” He says, “Yeah, I think so. It’s the one your ex-husband’s been using.” I say, “What?! What are you talking about? Why would either one of you want to use my bicycle?” It’s got the two white bars that go down and purple - it looks like a girl’s bike. He says, “That’s not what it looks like now.” I say, “What does it look like?” He says, “Well, your husband modified it. It’s got a motorcycle seat on it. And he took out the hump in the middle, so you can sit upright on it.” I’m starting to get riled up because he never asked me if he could do that. Then I look back at Omar and say, “This is the problem! He never respects my boundaries and he always does these things without asking first. Do you think it’s unreasonable that it upsets me?” He says, “No that is a normal thing.” Then he makes reference to his ex-wife and he says, “Even in my marriage, we asked each other for permission.” Then he starts laughing and he takes a piece of paper and shows me - it’s written the way you would write out a script in a play with the one person’s name, then the colon and the line then the other person. There’s 10 lines of just one-liners. First it’s him and his ex-wife, him and his ex-wife, yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, all the way down. Then one of them throws their hands up in exasperation and says: “Okay fine!” So he just hands it to me and I read this. Then he’s laughing and says, “Well at least it’s agreement.” Then I’m laughing, too, and say, “Yeah, it’s better than just taking it without asking, then modifying, then just walking away again, leaving it in the modified form so I can’t use it anymore.” Then he says, “Alright, well I have to go to work.” So I follow him down the hallway. As I’m passing through the kitchen, I look at the store and think, “Why is it at 77 degrees Celsius?!” I look with alarm and think, “Oh yeah, that’s from the man consciousness body.” I see the three loaves of bread in there and they are starting to disintegrate with the heat. It’s vaporizing the plastic bags, and I think, “Oh, isn’t that going to melt and cause some trouble in there?” But the temperature is so high that it just vaporizes. Then I realize I have to leave that there because this is the man consciousness’ house. But when I get in the hallway and go to say goodbye to Omar, I see two jackets. I realize one is the 4 year old boy, one is the 8 year old boy, and I look at Omar in alarm and say, “What are they doing here in this house?! They’re not supposed to be here.” But the part of me that is also in the man’s body sees that they belong to his kids. The consciousness that is me suddenly categorizes the overcrowding of stuff and not tidying up and putting away is from his kids. He’s making this money and also has this dual role of taking care of his family even though he’s doing it illegally. At that moment, he’s simultaneously opening the door and there’s my own two cats. They get out of the house and start to go up the street which is now a different street. It’s crowded with people and families. Kids are playing in the snow and it’s wintertime. Everybody has on snowsuits. There are toboggans and some ice and people are skating. I see my one cat has been interested by a bird. There is a group of people that are around my other cat and they’re putting snow on him and patting him with the snow and he’s enjoying it. So I get her first - I catch her just before she leaps into the air to take off after the bird. But I know I can’t carry them both at the same time. So as I’m walking back to what is now my own house, I see Kathryn, one of my students, and I ask if she can hold my cat for a moment while I get the other one. She says, “Oh no, I’ll just grab this one.” And she gets the second cat while I still have my first cat and am putting him back in the house. Then she sets him down for a second while she frolics off and does something else. I just think, “What is wrong with people that they just can’t follow through?” Then I put my tiny almost brittle cat back (her spine is uncomfortable when you pick her up and she gets squirmy) in the house and pick up my other one - he’s much heavier. I can feel his fur and his heavy body and his skin. So now they’re both back in the house. Everybody is safe and it’s just my house. My dream ends there.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

We’re together and he’s wanting to go from one island to the next. So we’re on the Big Island and trying to get to Maui. At least that’s the impression I have. But the setting doesn’t look like the islands I know. We are driving in a car and there's a baby in a car seat - I think it’s mine and his, but I’m not sure. I’m trying to tell him how in the past, I had island hopped. I would take my car and drive it down this really long stretch of road and catch enough air to hop the channel - a very wide expanse of ocean between the islands. Somehow I’m trying to convince him I can do this. He’s very harsh. I’m trying to live up to expectations. It’s very strange because that is definitely not how I roll in real life. I’m driving the car to the place where I know we can catch enough air to ocean hop. We get to the end of the road - to this spot where I know I’ve done it before. There’s a huge wall rising up out of the ocean. It’s painted in colors of blue to look like the ocean. There’s actually ocean that comes over the top of it - water has been pumped over the top to make waterfalls. I’m shocked because it was definitely not there before. The times I had tried it, the road went off the edge of a cliff so you could catch some air. Now the road goes down and hits a shore. There's no way to catch enough air to get off of that and over this huge wall that’s now in front of us. I can feel that he is questioning me and what I’m telling him. He’s suspicious. I take the car and I get down to the bottom and see this is not happening. So I turn the car around. We head off to the right to an old dive bar. I say, “Maybe there’s somebody over there who can help us who’s done it before.” So we park and we go in. It’s totally dimly lit and smoky. The food is greasy and gross. We sit there and the woman who comes up to take our order reminds me of a friend of mine. She’s like, “Oh yea, I’ve figured out how to get over that wall. It takes certain skills and some special tools.” She’s also mad about something. She’s got revenge on the brain. She says, “I’ll show you how.” There are other people in this dive bar/diner breakfast place. They all look seedy and suspicious - rough around the edges. As this woman is talking to us, she’s super bitter and resentful. I can't tell if it’s because of where she works or the people she works with or what, but she’s definitely holding a grudge. She has her apron on and she’s holding her little notepad in her hand. We are trying to order some food and the baby is with us and sitting in its car seat - so strange because I can’t tell if this baby is mine or ours or what, but we’re taking care of it. She offers to go with us to get the car over the wall so we can go from one island to the next. It’s really important for us to go to Maui because I get the sense that it is a place where we will be free. So, she offers to go with us. Her and the ugy I’m with start hatching a plan and it’s kind of violent. She’s like, “yeah, you’ve gotta blow up this part of the wall.” So one of us has to swim under the waterfall part and plant these little grenades down low in the sand. I’m down iwth all of this, but another part of me is like, “this is fucking insane. All of it is insane. What is going on?” We all get into the car. At this point other people have joined in on the plan. They are her people. So she is following us with these other people in a car, or maybe we’re following them. We’re heading back to that part where the road stops down near the ocean, but you can see the wall. She gets in the water with a knife and what I assume are grenades or something. A bunch of other guys she's with - her crew - get in the water. I see the guy I’m with get in the water. I’ve got the kid in the car. Then I’m also going in the water. I don’t know who’s watching the kid at this point. We all swim out to this wall. You can tell this wall was built by humans and it’s a tactic to keep us fenced or hedged in. Now all of us are totally intent on blowing up this wall. There’s still an edge of violence, anger and rage coming off the guy I was with. But now you can tell it’s a suicide mission for the woman and she’s giving up her life for this. Her crew - all the dudes she’s with - same. This has turned into some sort of “for the greater good” cause. I’m treading water and don’t know how this is going to work. At this point I’m mostly watching because I don’t have an active role in bringing this down. I’m not quite sure what my partner is either, but he’s got an important part to play. All I can see is that the woman has died under the water. Before she dives under she says, “I hope this serves,” or something like that. I watch her dive under the water and she puts the grenades down at the bottom. The wall explodes and she explodes - actually, she disintegrates in front of me. Somehow I’m fine even though I’m in the water - I’ve backed up enough that this isn’t going to affect me. I watch a portion of the wall come down. Then me and the guy I’m with swim back to the car and we back way up the road in the car. He’s still like, “this better work” and he’s going to blame it on me if it doesn’t. At this point, “I’m like, dude, you guys did all that crap. If it doesn’t work then I don’t know what to tell you.” But the urge to be free is really strong for both of us, so we’re both willing to try anyway, even though he seems completely ready to scapegoat me for whatever doesn’t happen. I’m a little pissed off about all that. So we back the car up all the way up and get as much speed as possible and somehow manage to launch over the broken part of the wall and make it to Maui. At this point, the dream completely shifts. Now I’m on the top of a hill. There’s a sports store where I’m working. Down below is another type of store - it looks like a UPS shipping center warehouse or something like that. To the left of that is a gym. I think I’m working in the sports warehouse store. I’m trying to get a good selfie, but in some of the pictures, I’m naked from the waist down and in some of the pictures I’m completely naked and in some of the pictures I have all my clothes on. I have no idea what I’m doing or what that’s for, but apparently I’m trying to get a good selfie to post on instagram. As I’m going back to work after this, I run into a friend - I think it’s an old classmate. He’s like, “Oh my god, I didn’t know you worked here.” I’m like, “Yes, I’ve worked here for a while. It’s a cool place to work.” He’s like, “Did you know that our friend Levi works down at the shipping center?” I’m like, “Oh no, I didn’t know he was down there. Sweet. One more person for me to sleep with!” He’s like, “Yeah, Kahenu works at this store with you, too.” I’m like, “Oh, I forgot that Kahenu was here. Awesome. One more person to sleep with!” This guy is pointing out to me all these people I know and I could sleep with. I’m totally stoked about it. Somehow, Jennifer Lopez shows up. She’s a fitness instructor for all the female employees. I’m watching her doing a workout and they’re all doing it with her. They’re all badass, totally kicking ass, covered in sweat from head to toe. They do have all their clothes on, but it’s bootie shorts and sports bras. For part of this workout, J Lo is in roller skates and some of it is coordinated because some of it is part of a music video. I watch them all working out, dripping sweat. Then she gets her roller skates and starts skating down the hill because this sports warehouse is at the top of the hill. All of these women, at least 25 if not more, are following her down the hill as part of this music video. I’m observing all of this and not making contact with all the people. I see Levi coming in and out of the building, but I don’t actually talk to him. I see Kahenu and start walking behind him. He turns around me and sees me and his eyes glaze over then get wide and he actually sees me, then he gets suspicious looking again. He turns around and keeps walking. I’m behind him and like, “Hey you know me! Don’t pretend you don't know me.” Then the scene shifts one more time. I’m in a home, but now I’m in the observer role. I’m watching this woman who is pregnant with her third kid interact with the husband. The husband could give two fucking shit about her or the kids. She is trying so hard to engage him. She is being a super good mom. Her two little boys are probably 4 and 6 or maybe 5 and 3. They’re a little bit of a handful. She’s maybe 8 or 9 months pregnant and definitely putting on a persona of the cheerful, happy, bubbly wife. She’s also really, really short, maybe 4’8 or 9 - not that much taller than her kiddos. Her husband is going off to work and she’s saying, “Hey, have a nice day, honey!” His face is glued to his phone. I can tell that he’s on the phone texting a mistress or scrolling through pictures of other women. I have judgment around it. I’m also watching her trying to keep him engaged, and he’s just like, “Yup, yup, going to work, bye, see you later.” I see him leaving and her trying to engage her two sons in play and learning like a home or unschooling situation.",Rose,last_nights_dream
483,1343,,11/04/2020,04/11/2020 00:03,"“The Disc, the Irish and the Owl” This dream I think I am in some kind of consciousness of one of my best friend’s from high school. I’ll call her Ellie. She died of cancer in her thirties in real life. The dream setting is I’m in outer space on a big round disc. It’s flat and shiny on one side and rough and rocky - the rocks are black with granules in them, like sand, that seem to be picking up a little bit of stellar light. There are lines on top of the disc that radiate out from the center towards the periphery. In the center are a few people. As I get closer to the disc, I’m standing on it in one of the radii. There’s my friend, Ellie. She takes me around the disc and I seem to gelan that there are twelve of these radii. Each one goes towards the periphery and there’s a door on the periphery. I go into some of the doors and see people. The first one I go in is a washroom. There’s various people in there and they’re trying to get something sticky off their hands. I feel a little confused as to why I’m in here - I don’t know what I’m supposed to discover or look for. So because it’s a washroom, I go into one of the stalls and decide to sit down on the toilet and see if I can urinate. I do. Then I take some toilet paper. It’s sticky! So, I wipe myself, but then it won’t immediately leave my fingers and go into the toilet. So I get another piece. I try to wash the first piece off my fingers, but it too is sticky. I rub my fingers together to try and get it off, put it into the toilet and it does. It disintegrates a little, but there are still pieces on my fingers. I dress and go to wash my hands. I notice that there’s little bits of shit all over everything. Now I don’t want to touch the taps because I think that will get on my fingers. I can start to smell it now and it’s disgusting. I just want to leave that area. I think there are little bits of shit on my leg and the back of my jeans and on my arms and clothing. Just little tiny pieces. I can’t find anywhere to wash that’s also not covered with shit. I come out of the bathroom and look at Ellie. Then I look down at myself and it’s all cleaned. So I wonder why she’s taking me through these experiences. She sends me down to what would be the 6 o’clock position. We had been standing at 12 and this washroom was about at 2 o’clock. There are people in some kind of friction, perhaps arguing. I don't get involved with that. Instead of going all the way around the clock, I come back up the same side I went down towards her. Without saying anything, I communicate to her that I’m really not enjoying this experience. She says, “Let’s go back to my house for dinner.” She’s from a large Irish family with 6 kids. We appear in her house. A few of the kids have a friend, so there are a large number of people in the kitchen. There were four boys in that family, two of them were twins and then herself and her sister. The twin boys each have a friend over and there’s one extra friend. The older two boys are in the den watching tv. I look at the friends and think that they’ve been smoking. The mom puts the meat on a plate and puts it on the table. I think to myself that there’s not enough for the number of people that are there, but I’m not very hungry anyway. So I don’t take my plate and line up to get food. The boys and their friends do. They take almost all of it and there’s just Ellie, her sister and me and the two parents who haven’t eaten yet. They tell me to take my plate and go get some. So I take the saucer from underneath the tea cup, so it’s a very small plate and I just put a little bit of meat on it, a tiny bit of potato and some gravy. Then I turn around and there’s this whole other plate of meat. So I say, “Oh, I didn’t see that.” They say, “Oh that’s okay, here, take another piece.” Somebody puts another forkful on my plate. So we eat. Then the boys and their friends go back outside for a little while to run off some of their energy. I go into the sisters’ room and see that it used to be the pantry because there’s not very much room to walk around the bunk bed. Somehow or other, Ellie’s sister has managed to sit in this little tiny space and she’s playing with some plastic toys that are lined up on the floor. She seems to be happy. I go back out. Now I feel like I have somehow become Ellie because she is gone and I’m just there and her family is treating me as though I am her. I go out into the kitchen, clean up the rest of the dishes. Then I check on the boys - I go into the den. The mama is in there as well and someone comes to the door and she knocks on it and asks the mom for some help. The mom lets her in and offers her some food. The woman accepts the offer, takes some and asks the mom if she will take out her stitches. So the mom gets some first aid things, gets her food, takes out her stitches, wraps the food up for her, sends her away out the door. As the woman is leaving, she says, “I’ll see you again in the morning.” I think to myself, “Wow this family gives so much to other people.” Then I leave the den, go back out into the kitchen and the boys come home. I look at them and their eyes are red. I think they’ve been smoking and I wonder why no one else seems to comment on them. But one of the twins looks guilty and puts his head down and doesn’t meet his mother’s eyes when he walks by her. Now it’s nighttime. Everybody is getting ready for bed. The whole family is home. I go into my room. I see an owl. It’s looking in the window at me. I realize it’s a pink owl - that’s the name of the species. I like a cigarette and smoke it. So, now I’m confused. I realize that Ellie smoked in high school, so I must be her. I lie in bed, watching into the night and I see the owl fly off towards some celestial body in the sky. Then it becomes morning. I haven’t slept. I just stayed in my bed. I only had one cigarette, but the room is smoky. I get up in the morning and instantly the bedroom changes into an eating area again. There’s all kinds of extra people in it - everybody has an extra friend. There are extra adults who have come with the parents and there’s food on the table. The meal is shared around again and it seems to keep growing from the plate. Even though it doesn’t look like there’s enough food to satisfy everyone, there seems to be enough. Then the food is cleared away and the dishes are brought into the kitchen to be washed. When I’m out in the kitchen, the final scene I notice is one girl that was very nasty. Her name was Lynn. She’s also sitting in the middle of the kitchen. I remember she was a person who tried to insert herself into the friendship that I had with Ellie, but it didn’t really work. There were no ties or anything in common. She’s sitting there and no one is talking to her. I just walk by her, noticing her presence, but don’t speak with her. She is not nice. I don’t look at her and don’t want to interact. I continue washing dishes and then wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

486,812,,12/04/2020,04/12/2020 00:02,"I am at a teahouse - it reminds me of Samovar in San Francisco. I’m enjoying tea with a man and looking at his hands to see if he is wearing a wedding band. I have a memory of walking and talking with him and seeing a wedding ring. Now, his left ring finger is bare and his right ring finger has a silver band. Then I excuse myself to go to the bathroom. I walk in and am so disgusted. There is diarrhea all over the floor and big sticky gobs of shit everywhere - toilet seat and floor - and an especially disgusting yellow mucousy looking one dripping off the handicap bar. There is toilet paper strewn all over, too. I still have to pee. I end up getting shit on my hand. Then I’m trapped in this repeated portion of the dream, where I am trying to pull my pants up. I have one of my son’s diapers on and as I’m pulling the pants and diaper up, I keep smearing poop on the outside of the diaper’s right panel. It’s gross. I’m trying to repeat the scene in the dream to make the poop disappear, rather than deal with cleaning it up. I am in this bathroom with all this shit for a really long time. The dream shifts. I’m at a restaurant, sitting at a table all by myself. I’m looking out across the other tables and I see an acquaintance, Liz, and her husband. She is wearing a revealing black and red snake skin dress that displays her body and all her tattoos. She’s also wearing high red shoes. She’s flaunting her body. She’s looking back and forth at me and my husband. I see that my husband is sitting at a table near her. My husband is sitting with another person - this person is both the man I was enjoying tea with and a woman, somehow. Liz has a haughty look about her, assuming things aren’t going well with my husband because I’m sitting alone and my husband is enjoying the company of another person for dinner. Liz gets up and walks around to my husband’s table to say hello. All the while, her chin is lifted and she’s looking back and forth between my husband and me in this “knowing” way. It’s extremely uncomfortable. Her husband is also looking back and forth, more curious than haughty. The dream shifts again and I’m in a store. I have two massage tables set up near each other. I’m on probation and they’re deciding whether to imprison me or not. A man comes in - he’s the one who makes the decision. He lies down on one of the tables. Another woman who is also in charge is on the other table and the tables are actually right next to each other. We move the tables apart a bit. I massage his neck and head. He gets up to take care of some work. I tell him his scalenes and upper trapezius muscles were very tight, and I tell him what I did. Even though the work was good, they decide to imprison me. They lock me up in a room. At first I’m quiet but then after they leave, I bang on the door. The man from the tea house is there on the other side of the door. I ask him to help me, but he won’t.",Ana,last_nights_dream1

488,1344,,12/04/2020,04/12/2020 00:04,"“The Greenhouse” This dream begins in the house I grew up in for a little while. I’m standing in the driveway and I see my ex-husband drive up. He’s in a van and he comes out of the van. He’s loading things from the back of the van onto the driveway. I see his dead son, whom I never met in real life, get out of the van with him and sit on the driveway. Then my ex is busy with something at the other end of the driveway. Now there’s a hill where the back up the van is, going up to where my ex is busy. His dead son is trying to climb up the hill to get to him, but he can’t because he can’t walk. He was crippled in real life. So I go over to help him. I put my arm around his waist and my other hand is digging at the earth and I’m draggin him up with me so he can get there. Now it’s muddy and I keep sliding back down. We finally make it to the top and we’re both covered with mud. I see the son is beside his dad. I turn around and go inside the house to clean myself up. As I’m doing this, I notice that mud has been tracked into the house - into the kitchen and dining room. I want to clean it up and wonder how it got in here. I realize that his dead son has been walking through the house. I have something in my hand - I think it’s a cloth to wipe up the mud with. I notice that already there’s potato bugs and worms crawling around. The worms are like maggots. They’re stretching themselves across the floor, then shrinking up into smaller things. They’re migrating rather quickly. Then the cat comes in and starts walking though it. I’m like, “No! Stop, stop!” The cat goes backwards, but doesn’t see where it’s going and it falls all the way down the stairs. I’m like oh no! I run down the stairs and pick up the cat. It’s fine, but I feel horrible for yelling at it. I’m cradling it in my arms and see that it’s got two blue pieces of paper in its eyes keeping its eyelids open. One of the papers is frayed enough that I can just grab it in between my fingernails and pull it out. The other one is still in there. The cat starts to squirm and wants to get down. The ex comes in and says, “How did this mud get in here?” I say, “Well, Luke must have tracked it in.” He glares at me and gets really angry and says, “Don’t you dare say that name out loud.” I’m like, “What are you talking about? He was here. Didn't you see him outside at the top of the hill?” Now he’s really mad at me and tells me I’m a liar and stop saying that. So I say to him, “You didn't see him?” Then he storms out of the house. Then I remember that Luke told me to get vinegar to pour on it. So I go into the kitchen to get vinegar out from underneath the sink. I pour it on top of the mud that has the maggots and stuff in it. They all die. Then as I’m cleaning up, the dream deconstructs. I’m suddenly in my maternal grandparents’ house. I’m in the process of planting a garden. Their house is huge. It’s like a mansion down by the shore of the lake. The greenhouse has long raised beds in it and really tall domed windows that arc over the top. They’re really dirty. There’s an old garden that looks like it hasn’t been tended for a while. I leave the greenhouse and walk across the grounds into a shed and find some tools. But as I open the shed door - it’s creaky and there are cobwebs. I find a hoe and some shears. I take them back to the greenhouse. I start to till and aerate the earth with the hoe. I notice that some of the plants that decayed and died have seeds in them. I’m making sure that I shake the plant - agitate it a little, so some of the seeds go into the earth as I’m hoeing. Then a man comes up - I assume he is the gardener. He is wearing a uniform and he questions what I’m doing. I tell him I am restoring the garden. He starts giving me some instructions. I say, “Did you used to be the gardener here?” He says yes. I realize that he’s also dead. He can’t do what he’s instructing me to do. So I listen to him. I ask if he knows where there’s any vinegar. He says, “Yes, there is some here. I will arrange for it to be delivered to you.” So I start to till up one side - there are two long raised beds, 30 feet long each. As I till the greyed earth on top, I see there’s rich black earth underneath. I feel inspired by this task. Then I see that some kind of delivery has appeared. I remember that I also asked him for some balck earth. So there’s a bag of black earth and some vinegar. There’re also buckets, cloths and a sponge mop. I think, “Great, I can wash these windows so the sun can come through.” I do that. It looks beautiful. Then on the other side, there’s a child - I don’t know who it is. I start showing them how to till up the earth so that seeds can be planted in holes, then how you can make the raised be up around the small plants, then you’ve got a little line between where water can go and people can walk if needed. So this child is helping me, but I still don’t know who it is. At the end of the day, I end up with some tall seed flowers in the back, some sustainable things we can eat coming up, as well as some herbs. There’s soup herbs, soup vegetables, fruit, nuts, pollinator flowers and natural insect repellent flowers. I picked red, yellow, orange and purple flowers. So it’s going to be a beautiful garden. We’re not all done, but it’s just too much to do in one day, so we leave. The child disappears. I’m walking across the grounds which are quite large. It takes a little bit of time to walk. When I get to the other side, I’m at the road. I walk up the road. I start to go through the outskirts and through old suburbia with 300 year old trees. I come to a house and realize it’s a rental. There’s a bottom floor for rent and top floor for rent. Suddenly a real estate agent appears and is describing when the tenants are leaving. The bottom floor is going to be empty today, the top floor tenants aren’t going to be leaving for a couple weeks. So she asks if I’m interested in the bottom floor. Since they are in the process of moving, it’s okay for us to go in. I really like it. I love the treed lot. There’s lots of natural shade over the sleeping area. The bedrooms are large and I like how the bedrooms are separated from the activity part of the house. So it will be good for sleeping. The kitchen is nice and big - there’s enough space for eating and a prep area. So I tell her that I’ll take it, but I’m also wanting to put a catio outside of the entry to the backyard so I can put my cats in it and they'll have lots of space to climb and run. Now the current tenant is there. Suddenly he has something I can easily use as a catio. He has a strange creature in it. At first I think it’s a dog, but as I get closer, I realize it’s some kind of rodent about the size of a small dog. I think it’s from South America. He’s a very sullen man - he doesn’t look like he wants to talk. I do ask him what kind of pet that is. He doesn’t answer me. He keeps the same expression on his face. We go back into the house and now I realize that I need roommates for this because there are four bedrooms and I can’t afford it by myself. There's the question of who will be the roommates. The real estate agent is interviewing some people. Two of them I know there is no way I can live with. One is someone I know and have actually lived with before, and I say, “Yes, that will work. Please interview her.” Suddenly I’m moved in and I’ve been living there for a little while. I have two other roommates. I feel like they came with the house. The one roommate’s bedroom, when I’m trying to sleep, they’re sleeping area moves out like an extending wall in a motorhome. When he goes in to sleep, the bed extends over the feet of my bed and I can’t stretch my legs out when I'm sleeping. So I don’t like this arrangement. I contact the real estate agent and say, “Okay, it’s been a couple weeks. Are the other tenants getting ready to move out?” She says yes. So I look at their place. It’s a little smaller, but I will still be able to keep the catio for my cats. So my dream ends where I’m saying, “Can we either ask these two other guys to move out, or is it okay that I just transfer my lease to the other side of the house?”",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

Our relationship was strained and we weren't ""in love"".   I didn't know what to do, yet I wanted our relationship to work.

I decided that we would have to have a serious talk and figure out what we could be doing better. I realized that there was a specific area in which I wasn't doing a good job. In the dream, I spoke clearly to her and formulated a plan for our next attempt at fulfilling sex. I want to say that the problem was that I wasn't as kind and affirmative as we were making love, but as I do not remember the words I spoke, I can't be sure.

490,1882,,12/04/2020,04/12/2020 00:06,"I was with some friends and we were trying to escape from our unknown pursuers. They were close behind us as we ran across open fields and grassland. As we climbed a hill, we saw a church building. It was old and dilapidated, and we entered hoping that they would not follow or would fail to find us. It was dark and musty inside with few hiding places large enough for me. I may have been a child, but I was larger than the others who had found nooks and crannies in which to stow themselves. I spotted a square hole in the back wall of the church, but it was just too small for me to squeeze through. I may have ducked behind a wooden railing at the front of the church, but it was no use. They had found us. We managed to slip past them out of a back door and run down a steep grassy hill behind the church. I could see my black horse a hundred yards away. We ran past and as we descended, it was only me and a girl. She was 10 years old or so, and I think I was not much older. I think that I was a boy, but I am not sure. We came to the edge of a steep hill, so steep that it was almost a cliff. Looking down was a small coastal town and directly before us, a dirt path in the grass descended sharply to the water. It had two wheel tracks as if it were made for vehicles. The girl hopped on her bicycle and took off down the hill. I was scared she would crash and hesitated before following on foot. As I watched her descend, I saw that she was heading toward a ramp which was attached to a small shed such that the ramp was flush with wall of the shed and came up to the roof. The problem was that the roof had an overhang such that I was sure that the girl would hit it and crash. I tried to warn her but she neither heeded me nor crashed. She made the jump and landed in the water. I was so convinced  that she couldn't have made the jump that I took her bike and tried it myself. I may have even called her back up from the water in order to prove my point. I remember explaining to her pedantically how what she had done could not have worked.  Eventually I too joined her in the water and we began to swim away. It was then that I realized that we were actually fish trying to escape from fishermen. I saw what happened previously. Two fishermen stood far above on the clifftop and threw two fish down into the water. The fish were us. It reminded me very much of scenes from the Ghibli film Ponyo. The water was bright blue and sparkled with a magical silvery white light. Then they prepared their fishing rod harpoons and began to shoot them at us. We swam out to see as quickly as we could, but my companion who had veered away to the left was snagged and taken. I sped up and was rushing through the waters at an incredible pace. I could feel the water rushing past me at what must have been 40 miles an hour. I felt and saw a harpoon dart streak past me and sped up again. The next dart hit me and before I could tell if I was trapped, the dream ended.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

But something happens that opens up an entire set of bleachers and suddenly more people are able to be there. I’m watching from the other side of the stadium. In my mind’s eye I’m seeing this area full of people watching a concert. It’s my birthday or something because I’m being celebrated or maybe it’s a wedding. In the next scene, I’m in a building in a hall - like you would rent to throw a birthday party or luau. There’s an alcove off to the side and a kitchen where you would put dishes. I’m still being celebrated somehow. The party in this hall is in my honor. But in this kitchen alcove are dishes from floor to ceiling - kind of Alice in Wonderland’esque because there’s a bunch of teacups, saucers, bowls, and spoons and they’re all dirty. My ex-mother-in-law is there and saying, “I know we’re celebrating you, but I’m sorry we didn’t get to these dishes and you’ll have to wash them all.” I tell her, “Don’t worry about it. I got it.” I don't have a problem washing the dishes. I’m not upset about it. Then I don’t know what happens after that. Now I’m in a studio but also a bathroom. I’m talking with my old boss from the pole studio. She’s trying to teach us how to do clock-legs the correct way in this studio/bathroom.

494,1345,,13/04/2020,04/13/2020 00:03,"“Locked Out” In the dream, I am supposed to teach at the Yoga Studio. I have loaded my car up with the props and driven to the town where the studio is. The town is actually really pretty, like a turn of the century town, probably built around the railroad. There are still remnants of that in the architecture, cobblestone, and gaslights on the street that have been converted to electricity. I meet the staff of the Yoga Studio at the coffee shop across the street. We chat about some upcoming themes. I cross the street with them. I’ve parked my car behind that building. They unlock the Yoga Studio and we go in to teach. We set up and I teach a yoga class. I come out and a man is sitting there. I don’t recall him being inthe class. We have a little conversation. I know him from university. One of the other staff comes out and suggests to the owner in front of me that my class was insensitive to someone’s trauma. The owner lets out a guffaw, because if anything, I’m known for my sensitivity to that kind of thing. She says, “What do you mean? Can you describe it?” The other staff member lifts her arms up towards the sky, bends her knees a little bit and says that someone’s thigh may have touched their belly in that pose. Again, the owner says, “Well if someone is that sensitive to themselves, then they shouldn’t be coming to class.” Meanwhile, I haven’t said anything, but I’m surprised that things have gotten this far where sensitivities are so cloistered that they can’t even be in a yoga class and we keep changing the world to adjust to that level of sensitivity. I’m kind of mulling that around in my mind thinking, “Is there any way to make the class more trauma-aware to body touching? Or has this gone too far?” So I’m thinking about this as everybody gathers up their things and leaves the building. By now, it’s nighttime. The owners lock the door and get in their car. Then I realize I don’t have my keys. I cross the street quickly and am yelling their names. I realize there are three cars with people in them and none are the owners, although I didn’t see them drive away. So I can’t get back into the studio to get my keys. I cross back the street again, which incidentally has a lovely median with a beautiful garden of flowers you can see in the dark. Now there are Parisienne cafe tables that only fit an espresso cup and saucer - maybe three or four, with people sitting there. I am hesitant to say anything to them. But I don't know what I’m going to do. I have no way to get in my car. I have no way to get home. It’s dark. I don't have my wallet. I don’t have my purse. I don’t have my cell phone. So I know the studio is not going to open until morning. I don’t know the studio owners’ phone numbers by heart. But this one man turns around and says to me, “Um, are you locked out?” I say, “Yes, I am. Sorry to trouble you, but I’m wondering if it’s okay if I use somebody’s phone?” I need to look up a number. The woman sitting in front of me - she’s probably a 20-year-old girl - hands me her cell phone. As I take it into my hand, I notice the buttons are plastic and raised. Even the action of bringing my finger from the bottom to the top sets off this string of numbers on the screen and I don't know how to erase that and I’ve never seen a cell phone keypad like this. The man beside me reaches over and corrects it for me. Then I dial 911, but every time I touch it, it enters four nines, and eight ones. I mimic what he did - I run my finger up from the bottom to the top and it goes away. I try it three or four times, and it’s so sensitive no matter how lightly I touch it. Then I realize, “Oh! Wait a minute. 911 is emergency. I need 411.” So when I punch in 411 lightly it goes in immediately. I think, “Oh there’s some kind of resistance to the phone to having 911 dialed for it. How interesting is that?” The 411 goes to some kind of opening where you have to speak and say the name, and it will automatically pull up numbers. So I do this and say the studio owner’s name. Then a screen pops up and I have to move my finger along the sliding scale for the distance I want covered as they search this name; otherwise, 9,000 versions will come up. So I do that. I slide the ruler around. I find the border of the town where I think she lives and I slide the ruler there. It comes up with 20 numbers. I have no idea which one is hers. I get discouraged. I tell the woman, “Thank you, but here is your phone.” So now I don’t know where I’m going to sleep. I know she lives close to the studio. She hasn't asked me if I need anything else yet. I stand there and then start to go up the street. All of a sudden, she’s in front of me. I see that she goes up an alleyway. I don’t follow her. I don’t see where she goes. I wait a few minutes. I’m in a parking lot behind the stores.There are only two levels of this building - the store on the bottom level and the apartments on the top. I choose one balcony. I think it’s hers because I know she has a cat and it looks like a cat would live there. There are some boxes piled up around. I climb into one of these boxes and think I’ll just stay here for the night. It’s not that cold out. Then, my dream shifts for a moment. That same staff member that said my classes weren’t sensitive to body-touch - it’s morning and she’s also sleeping in a box. We start to have a conversation when I look over and see three balconies down, a man hanging onto a blanket and another man trying to pull him up. The first man looks like he’s still asleep. As I stand up, I notice we’re not just one floor up from the ground, we’re 60! I get this big sense of vertigo and I can’t balance on my feet. It’s snowing out. His eyes and lips are blue and he either looks dead or frozen as though he’s stayed out all night long. The other man is pulling him up. The first man’s hand is stuck to the blanket and the other man is pulling him up. Now she runs out through the apartment, which is now hers, ostensibly to go down the hall to bang on the front door and ask if they need any help. But very quickly, the first man pulls him up and over. I think I should go tell her, but I don't because I realize by the time I get there, she’ll already know this information So I just wait till she comes back. Then the scene shifts back again. It’s just me outside this other young girl’s apartment. The balcony door is open now. I can see into her kitchen, which is really messy. There’s a washing machine and dryer, as well as a sink. It's very tiny. There’s laundry on the floor and things that haven't been put away on top of the counters. The cat comes in and I see it. It’s trying to climb up this stack of things because there’s a food bag up there. It’s going to feed itself. But as it is climbing up this stack of parcels and dirty laundry, the pile collapses and the cat slides down. I am just standing there, amused by this, watching the cat navigate through when she comes through the door to pick the kitty up. She sees me and says, “Have you been out there all night?” I say yes. She says, “Oh come on in, you don’t have to stand out there.” So I come in and ask if I can use the washroom. She says yes. Then the scene flips and it’s like a replay, only I'm outside and her house is this little tiny house in the middle of the desert. There are men on camels and they’re fighting and having some kind of war. Now both of us, the girl and I , are trying to race towards her house for safety before one of these warring guys hits us with whatever they’re throwing at each other. We do and now we’re back inside. Inside the house, I look down and think I’m okay to teach wearing this. I have stretchy capris underneath a wrap around sarong. My shirt will do and I have a jean jacket on top. I think, “Alright, I’m good to go. I can teach my morning class. I’ll find my keys in the studio, then return home and all this will be just fine.” The girl and I leave. She’s going to the morning yoga class anyway. We return to the studio. As we’re walking, I imagine that I see my keys on the studio counter. But I don't actually enter into the studio. My dream ends there.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I don't recall what it is we were doing there, but as I looked out across to my right, I saw a church building towering above us. It was where the old, red gym building is. Between us and the church was a house with a chimney. I saw smoke rising from where the chimney was, but something made me think that the smoke was not coming from the chimney but from a fire in the church behind it.   A voice in my head told me that the chimney was there and that the smoke had to be coming from it, as if to quiet any suspicions that the church was on fire. I turned away to my dad and brother who were in front of me and to my left. They were climbing over things on the roof. When I turned back to the church, I saw that it was going up in flames. It had caught fire quickly.  Within a few seconds, the roof of the church was engulfed in flames and burning debris had already flown toward our building the edges of which had already begun to burn.

I told my husband on my gosh I know him, I used to love him but things fizzled and he became manipulative and I got scared and left.

498,1346,,14/04/2020,04/14/2020 00:02,"“The Professor’s Car” This dream begins and I have my friend's daughter with my extended family on vacation. She has a few special needs and I am caring for her. She’s a really sweet, innocent child. She is innocent to the extent that she will trust anyone. We go to a number of places on a roadtrip - it lasts a week. I feel like we might be somewhere on the Eastern seaboard of the states by the temperate climate and the vegetation and trees, as well as the hills. It is quite beautiful. We visit some scenic places as well as some historical places. My friend’s daughter is a pleasure to be with and explore with. My family begins to find an affection for her. At some time, both of my ears become sore and infected. I can’t hear anyone. I’m sleepy and I’m not feeling well. For the past two days of the vacation, I can’t wake up and I stay in the travel van. At one point I wake up and my stepmother has put cotton in my ears and I wasn’t even aware of it. Then when we get back to where we’re staying I still sleep. They ask if I’m okay. I say, “Yes, I think I just need to sleep.” The vacation is over and now I return my friend’s daughter to him. When we get back to his place, he’s cleaned his apartment from top to bottom. He’s planted some beautiful plants in his bathroom - some look like cattails and bulrushes that are growing up from something in the floor around the toilet. The bicycles are all moved from the kitchen. I note that one of the bicycles is worth thousands of dollars. It’s got something for someone to sit on on the back of it, but the construction and design of it is so heavy that it takes two people to pedal it. So there is that provision. Where the bicycle chain and gears would be, there is a case overtop of it - to protect the inside of the legs of whoever is pedaling it. Then there’s another one of a different design, less expensive, more sporty for his son. So he says, “Would you mind waiting here just a little bit longer while I take these down to my garage space?” I say, “Yeah, sure.” So his daughter gets settled in her room and she’s happy to be home. She also doesn’t want me to leave. I tell her that I’ll see her again. My friend comes back up from putting the bicycles away and asks if I would like to see the car he has. I say, “I thought you didn’t have a car.” He said, “Well I did, I just couldn’t find it. But now that I’ve cleaned, I’ve got space for it and the bicycles.” I say sure. So he’s already removed it from the garage. The son stays with the daughter and my friend takes just me out for a ride. He says, “I thought you would enjoy this. I wanted to thank you for taking care of her for the week.” The car on the outside is a mint green. I notice the car’s age. It must be from the 1970s. It’s a Ford Metro. We get in and there’s chrome and teak on the inside. He presses a button and the dash expands upwards. It’s just beautiful. Everything is made of wood - the dashboard, it wraps around the driver’s side, the passenger’s side, goes all the way to the backseat; it’s on the inside panels of both doors and looks hand carved. There are these different controls. The steering wheel is a combination of teak and chrome as well. He’s pressing buttons and starting things. The car starts to take off and it feels like it’s gliding over the road. I also notice that we’re going at a fair speed and it’s not rattling or shaking. I comment to him that it’s really impressive how it drives. I say, “How is it possible that you have a car this old and this good of shape?” He says, “Well, I hardly ever drive it. It doesn’t have very much mileage on it.” I think, “Wow, that’s really preserved it. This is exceptional.” We stop at an ice cream place. Here, I stand still. There’s an outdoor table, like the kind that comes up to your chest. It’s got a small round dias on the top. I’m doing something here with my ears. I need to take the packing out, putting it in plastic and throwing it away and replacing it. I have privacy. While I’m doing this, 2 or 3 young women (not teenagers, maybe early twenties) are grouped around the car and he’s talking to them. So I linger a little longer over my task. Then they walk off. But he’s still talking. So he directs what he was saying to me. I catch the last two or three words, but they’re muffled. He says, “You weren’t listening to anything I was saying, were you?” I say, “No, I am. But I couldn’t hear what you said first. I was way over there. My ears are really sore and I just can’t hear. Would you mind repeating it? Is it about the car?” But he doesn’t and he’s a bit peeved that I didn’t listen. So we both go into the store. It’s just a regular gas station. I don’t need anything, so just linger around the doorfront. He picks up a few things and we get back into the car. We drive a little further. I’m asking him about the car. We return to his house. I get out before he parks the car in the underground garage and go back up to the apartment. Then I just give his daughter a hug. By that time my friend has re-entered. He thanks me again and I just say, “See you later, “ and leave. Then I walk back from his apartment to the house I’m temporarily sharing with my extended family. Now, I’m working in some kind of school, preparing lessons. While I’m in the building, I notice my friend’s daughter. She’s attending the school. I’m concerned about the treatment she receives from the other teachers. I suspect that one of the other teachers may be harsh with her. I’m trying to figure out if this is true. I’m keeping an eye on these things. The other teacher I’m suspecting is an older woman. She’s wearing a plain simple dress. She looks like Jane Eyre. At one point, one of the students or an assistant of sorts, is helping my friend’s daughter in the washroom. When they are finished, I say, “Excuse me. Do you mind? I just need to talk to you for a second.” She is acting hedgy and fidgety. She doesn't want to stand too close. I’m saying to her: “This is important. I would appreciate it if you would give me your full attention and stand still.” So she does for two seconds. Then she starts looking around again. I say, “If you’re uncomfortable with this, we can make an appointment. But I thought we could just talk here for a second and then you can be on your way. Is there somewhere you need to go?” She says no. I say, “Well , are you able to stand here for a few minutes?” I can’t figure out why she’s fidgeting. I’m wondering if she needs to use the washroom. I ask, “Is there somewhere else you need to go?” She says, “I’m just not supposed to be talking to you.” I think, “Oh this is weird.” She is the assistant for the teacher that I think might be being abusive and she’s been instructed not to talk to me. I think this is significant. Then I tell her about my rank in the school and she needs to sit there and listen to me because I’m starting to feel like the other teacher has her assistant covering for her. Now I’m really suspecting that she is as abusive as I think she is. So I pull rank. The student stands still. I read her something and tell her it is part of her job, it is her responsibility and she signed a paper to report any abuses or marks on the students that she sees. If she does not report it immediately, she is also subject to the abuse. So I can see her face as I’m reading this. Now she is paying attention. Her eyes widen and I think she knows something. So I tell her that I’m going to be watching her. Then she leaves, looking alarmed. Then my friend’s daughter is still in the washroom. I go in and check her, but she doesn’t have any marks on her. I tell her that If anything happens, she is to come see me right away and I’ll take her home to her dad.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

Traveling through Asia as a college kid, following in with an anarchist gang and getting into a lot of trouble. Fleeing a penitentiary sentence I escaped to an island and found my true love. He didn’t believe in marriage or monogamy and I found space to allow his love in my life and not have it be the center of my life. I accepted his conditions. I raised our child kind of solo with him in and out for long periods of time. He ran a hostel on the beach which is where I met him. There was never a sentiment of hate or resentment. At some point I decided to leave the island with my kid and travel back to the states and settled down there for a while. When the child grew up I returned to my nomadic Ways and wandered back to the island. There were no phones or anything like that but I found my love at the hostel and we settled in together there until he died. This dream spanned from age 18 to 70. I was grateful for what I had. I didn’t control or expect anything, which is weird, because it is not how I am in waking life. I woke up missing him. I accepted a lot of limitations, particularly with my lover, and surrendered to it - having a beautiful life with and without him.

She is looking around the room. I look down and see two snakes. At first I assume they are just plastic. They are both black, yellow and red. One is primarily yellow, the other is primarily red. Then I look more carefully and see they are alive. I stop for a moment and think this is impossible. But they are both stretching out towards my mom and one has its tongue out as if tasting the air around her leg. Then I realize they are alive and I urge my mom to stand back because these snakes are alive. She quickly moves back. Then, we realize it’s a test of some kind. One snake is poisonous and the other is not. Which one is poisonous? We are trying to remember by their markings.

We are talking about family dynamics, particularly our parents’ dynamics. She tells me that her mom told her that her dad would never leave because it’s too complicated. Somehow, her saying this reassures me. Then someone comes and ties back the lavender with bungee cords to tame it and help guide its growth, so it doesn’t overcrowd the hallway.

I just came in and there was only one space and I just stood here.” Then they proceeded to go and tell other people that I cut and I’m not a good person. I was getting so upset because I didn’t do it on purpose, I came in and it was the only space to go to. Then at a certain point, some guy came in. He was telling a story and he had the loudest booming voice, as if he had a microphone, but it was his normal voice. I think he was a famous actor. Everybody was enamored with him, but I wanted to be as far away as possible because his voice was so loud and it was hurting my ears. Then someone said to me, “You know, you should probably leave. These really aren’t your people. These people aren’t good for you or on your frequency.”",Mary,last_nights_dream

He’s not away for very long, just a couple hours. So when I enter the apartment, the door is not locked. In fact, it’s ajar. The dog is just lying down on the floor. He has birds in a birdcage. The birds are making a really loud noise. As I approach the birdcage, I notice the door is wide open. The cage is rectangular, 2 feet long, a foot high, and a foot deep. So the door is 2 foot by 1 foot and is open. Yet the birds don’t try to leave. The song is not the song they would normally make and this puzzles me. There’s a mixture of birds - pigeons, song birds, sparrows. None of them are making their song. It’s this rapid alarm noise and they’re all making it despite different species, which also puzzles me. I wonder if they’re afraid of the dog. But I’ve been in this apartment before visiting, and I know that the birds and the dog will sit together on the floor, so I don’t think that’s the reason. So I feed the dog. Then I wonder why he hasn’t asked me to feed the birds. I look around to see if there’s any food and there isn’t. Then I’m curious about this noise they’re making again. And I wonder why they don’t fly out of the cage because they sound afraid to me. As I get closer to the cage, their noise stops. As I back away , it gets louder. I wonder if I should stay to comfort them. Then the dream just ends.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream1

In the story, she has a childhood nightmare and she's written a story about it as a 20-something year old person. She’s taken the idea to go back through her own story in order to ease it or release it. I’m one of the people that is in the story with her. We go down to the shore of the lake and there’s a prearranged yellow inflatable raft - like an expensive Zodiac dinghy. There are three or four others with us. We get into the dinghy and we’re dressed for whaling. We are wearing rain gear and waterproof boots that are zipped into the rain gear. In the story, that I become aware of as we’re moving through the water, her father is a whaler. She has nightmares about some things that happened when she was a kid and went whaling with her father. We get closer to the area we’re supposed to be. At first I see everything from far away and I feel a fear and my heart rate is starting to build because out on the water, there are giant metal things. They look really small right now, but I’m already thinking that they are going to be really big and we are going to be really small once we get closer.I’ve never been whaling before. I question agreeing to go on this excursion. Obviously, we get closer. Then there’s this circle thing that other people in dinghies are gathering around. It’s like a large buoy. As we approach, we’re not allowed to go any further. We have to wait with these other people and we are just kind of circling around this really large bouey. The buoy is probably 30 feet tall - I can’t even see the top of it. We’re waiting for someone who has organized this to arrive. I notice that the other people in the dinghies all seem to be seniors. I wonder if they’re here as tourists. Finally the person that’s organized it arrives and I don’t see who they are. People start being able to leave out through the gate. We are now moving from that area out towards these large metal things. I feel really anxious and horrible as I can see there are hooks. I think to myself that the whales must have hung from these hooks. I’m just in the space of horror as she’s conversing with the organizer of this excursion. The dinghy gets closer to them, and as I thought, they are really large. We are quite small. The seniors in the other boats are pointing at them and oohing and awing. We circle around them. The dinghy goes a lot slower. Then we start to reverse the direction and go back. We get out of the dinghy at the buoy. Now there’s reef and shallow water vegetation and a pier. I just get out on foot and continue on.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream2
507,1349,,15/04/2020,04/15/2020 00:07,"“The Board Meeting” In this dream, I am in a townhouse complex. It opens and I’m having a day to myself where I realize I can do whatever I want. I’ve decided I’m just going to play my guitar. I get my guitar out and am setting it up. I see out my window that my stepmother is leaving. Through the window, although I can’t hear her voice, she tells me that she’s told the board of directors that I’m going to take her place for the day and be the secretary and record her notes. I’m annoyed and then she’s gone. I don’t even have time to tell her this is my only day to myself and I didn’t even agree to this. Now instead of having the day, the board of directors is filing into my house. I notice that they’re the seniors from the day at the whaling place when they were just there as onlookers at this whaling equipment and remarking over it. This also annoys me. The meeting starts and they’re talking about things. As I’m recording this, I’m noticing that no one is really sharing the conversation. No decision is being made. They’re just talking about everything. They move from one thing to another and it’s taking an extraordinary long period of time and it’s unproductive. I start doodling on my page and not really recording anything. Then they get to a conversation where someone has brought up that they smell marijuana in the complex. I think to myself, “Well, of course you do. It’s legal in Canada now.”They’re talking about the smell. They don’t like walking through smells. I think to myself, “yeah, I’ve smelled it for about half a second when I’ve been in a canoe on the water and no one else is around. I’ve smelled it for another half a second when I’m walking on a sidewalk to the grocery store.” So the clouds of smoke from somebody’s house half a mile away have drifted around like other smells do from the kitchen and people’s bathrooms. I’m thinking, “How much longer are they going to go on talking about the smell and they can’t even do anything about it. This meeting is unproductive.” So I set down the pad of paper I’m writing on and I wander off to a different area of the room. I actually get my guitar out again and wonder if they can hear me. I start tuning it very quietly and no one says anything. Then I start playing a song. Then I hear on the agenda that they’re talking about someone who has asked for a refund of $26.57 for something the board processed that they shouldn’t have. I think, “Oh, that was me! That was years and years ago. I’d forgotten about that.” So I set my guitar down and go back to the table. I’m listening to the process of their conversation and wondering if they just talk about this at every meeting for three years and never get it off their list? I wonder if they’re going to get it off their list this time. I don’t even care about it now and it’s a small amount. I’d forgotten about what it was for and as I’m listening to the conversation, I’m thinking, “Oh yeah, they shouldn’t have charged me for that. So one of the men that was on the whaling excursion, he's sayinsaucerg that she’s right and they should reimburse her the money. He doesn’t realize it’s me. Someone else from the board says, “Well, where will the money come from?” I mentally roll my eyes and think, “Geez, they don’t even have a treasurer.” Then someone else says, “We need to put in a request for that.” Then I just wander away from the table again, thinking, “Wow, they will never get anything done. Maybe they’re just here because there’s nothing else for them to do.” I go back to my guitar.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream3

509,740,,16/04/2020,04/16/2020 00:01,"This dream had a documentary tone. I was on a televised agriculture mission, but then approached by an androgenous person from a neighboring community. They wanted to switch places. When they recognized her, they knew they could switch and get to know the other community. She said yes, knowing they needed a break - knowing more in an omniscient way. It starts with me in a women’s camp environment - it was a futuristic settlement. Everyone wore farmhouse settler dresses and also face masks. This is a landscape I’ve been dreaming of all month but haven’t remembered any details until this episode. I discovered my twin doppelgänger and they had dominion over a galactic camp nearby. They looked like me - their appearance was female but they wore a burdensome huge mask covering head, face and shoulders with interlocking hydraulics spiked around the base. They’re in prairie dresses, but wearing steampunk style masks. You can’t tell who they are because they’re dressed the same and covering their faces. People aren’t addressing each other by name and interacting all day, but not in a personal way. They discovered me from a televised program I was on about agricultural excursions into the reaches of the community borders and asked to do an identity swap. I agreed but was scared. There was a salon area of town with “bars” like downtown but they were only big enough for 2 people each - like a redlight district. These are social distancing bars with screens at each bar, so you can join other people in conversation. It’s psychedelic with bright lights, but it’s dumpy, everything is falling apart. It reminds me of Blade Runner. Mischievous activity is afoot. There were men there. I was doing some restoration work on a building and my two nieces were underfoot chasing each other while I worked. I was stuccoing a building but in a beautiful artistic way with different plant dyed materials and kind of a dancing live art piece. There was a beautiful man dancing and I really wanted him. We started doing the tango and it was very sensual and stimulating. I was breathing heavily and filled with desire but told him I had to go finish my work and I ran home.",Tita,last_nights_dream

We see a mama and baby swan, a rodent/marsupial mama and baby, and another mama and baby animal. He points out a small black bat struggling in the water. We are watching it as it splashes. He’s asking me about it: “Is that a bird, mama?” I tell him it’s a bat. I’m concerned it could have rabies. Other people and kids come by. They are climbing around the rocks. A woman holds my son and then gives him back to me saying he pooped in his diaper. I’m surprised because he’s potty trained. But I do see that her dress is soiled and so is his diaper. I take him away to change even though he wants to stay and play. We return to the cottage. I see Trina, a friend and former boss. She says, “Oh, I need you to run an errand for me. I need you to carry my pet wombat to my other house.” I take this wombat with me on the trip and it is climbing all over me. It’s quite cuddly, cute and soft, like a baby. I arrive at her other house and see a lot of people. They are soaking in hot tubs by the lake. There isn’t a spot for me here. Then Trina’s husband wants to show me something. It’s a restaurant or storefront under construction. He wants my opinion about the flooring and decor.",Ana,last_nights_dream1
511,816,,16/04/2020,04/16/2020 00:03,"I am at a dance rehearsal. It’s the first rehearsal, so we are just learning the choreography. It’s really beautiful and dynamic with lots of interactions and refined contact improv. It is mostly men with just a few women. Then we all fall to the ground. We’re waiting for the next instructions. I’m next to my friend George - he’s gay and black. I look around through slitted eyes because we’re supposed to have our eyes closed. The choreographer instructs us that in the next few moments we are going to sit up and kiss people. This is a necessary part if we are going to remain in the cast. I’m not pleased about this. George whispers to me that now is my opportunity to get out. Somehow he slips away. The rest of us sit up and before I know what's happening an Asian man has pulled me into an embrace. His eyes don’t converge and it’s unsettling. One eye looks up and the other eye looks past me. He pulls me and I can feel him grab my lip with his teeth. I don't like it, but it’s not too awful. He continues to kiss and I try to kiss back because it’s what I’m expected to do. Then I feel his hand reach up to touch my nipple and I’m horrified by it. It feels awful. I hate it because I’m still so sensitive from nursing. So I push him away and think, “Fuck this, I’m not staying for this no matter what.” I quickly walk away and am in a library. It’s dark, no lights on. I’m wandering around as if it were a maze, and I’m trying to get lost so they can’t find me. In one aisle, I hear them talking about how I just got up and left without explanation and I need to come back. I’m wearing my fitted dance clothes. I notice in my hand a big wad of paper towels. I’m trying to figure out what to do with it because I don’t want to hold it or be found with it. I don’t have a pocket. I also don’t want to leave it on a bookshelf and there are no rubbish containers. I try to tuck it into my hair to hide it.",Ana,last_nights_dream2
512,1144,,16/04/2020,04/16/2020 00:04,"I’m heading home to the home I grew up in on the Big Island of Hawaii. I’m in a car. There are people with me, I think my siblings. It’s pouring rain - the kind where the roads are flooding. To get into the street that turns onto my cul-de-sac, we go over a stream. The stream is directly under the road but has come up over the road. I have to park the car. The siblings in the car are with me, but we’re not interacting - they’re kind of shadowed in the background. I have to get across the water to get into the cul-de-sac, so the car is parked. There are all these road workers here to help us. I get out and they’re very specific in showing me how to cross it. They’re going to help me get over it. They say, “This part right here is deeper because the water has worn so much of the road away. But we’ve put some rocks down right here for you to walk across.” I get the sense that there’s also a small child with me because I’m being extra careful because I have to help them get across, too. I think it’s actually my son. The workers help us across this water and it is pretty deep, but because the rocks are there, it only goes up to our knees. Then we cross over and get onto the road. It stops raining and there’s no more water, but it is wet. We walk past a neighbor’s house. They have strawberry guava growing in their yard and it’s ripe. So I stop and I pick a bunch to eat and a bunch to take with me to save for later or turn into jam or jelly. I show my son and he’s eating some of them. We continue down the road. We walk down the road a little bit and turn right to head down the street to my house. So, we’re walking that way. We’ve hit the end where there’s a stop sign and we’re turning down to the right. To the left, I can see the horse pasture my friend used to have her horses in. I am recognizing all the houses and am like, “Oh, I’m home, I’m home!” It feels good and normal. Then I’m walking down the street to our house. It’s different. Now my brothers have shown up. I don't think my sister is there, but we haven’t interacted yet. We get to the house. The house is different. The first thing we do is we all go into the backyard to see the stream because the stream we grew up with was such an important part of our lives, but we’d heard that our neighbor Andy had dug out his side of the stream. We get there and I look at it. The far side is a big wall that he dug out. It used to be that you could walk down the slope of our backyard into the stream and you could cross it to the other side and on the other side was a hill. There was a cow pasture and a barbed wire on the other side that you would have to cross, then walk up this hill or ridge. At the top you could see far out to a lava desert. But now, in the dream, that hill doesn’t exist. It’s just a rock wall. Instead of being flat where you could see the layers, it’s pebbled - you see this sometimes when you dig out all the layers of rock. The rocks are round and stacked on top of each other. They’re jutting out of the wall. My brothers are really sad that it’s been dug out. But I think it’s beautiful and also say, “Oh my god, I dreamt about this. I dreamt this happened to the stream.” It’s created caves on the far side underneath the wall and I think it looks beautiful now. But my siblings are really upset. We turn around and it’s time to go into the house. My mom and dad are there, but the house has been changed. They live in separate parts of the house - my mom lives in the big part. Somehow there’s a sidewalk or the road is in between or underneath forming a causeway, and you have to cross the causeway to the part where my dad lives. My mom and dad are kind of getting along. They’re a little snippy with each other. But it’s clear that my mom never goes into my dad’s side. You have to go up these stairs and then walk across this causeway and it opens up into a room that’s above everything. The room looks like an attic and there’s enough stuff that it could be an attic. There are all these paintings, photographs and pictures nailed to the wall. What sticks out in my mind is that this little causeway I walk over is just plywood placed over a bunch of joists and it’s not particularly safe and the thought crosses my mind, “Oh my dad is old and he shouldn’t be walking on this kind of floor where you have to walk on the joists so the plywood doesn’t tip up at the corners and come off.” It seems strange to me. My brothers are with me and we’re all going. Now my friend Dorian, who I grew up in this neighborhood, is with us, too. He’s there and keeps asking all these poignant questions. I can tell he’s trying to help me and my parents reconcile. That’s his role. He has a very loving presence. My whole life he had a loving presence, always very kind. This is radiating from him. So I look at this place where my dad is living. He says, “Do you like it? Do you like the way it’s decorated?” I’m looking at all of these pictures. The walls are made of plywood and not painted, so the pictures are fading into the backaryd. There are all these pictures of ships and oceans with clouds over the top, like old-fashioned oil paintings. For whatever reason, the colors used for all three paintings match the same shades and tones of the plywood walls and they’re fading into the background. So I look at him and say, “If you paint just this section with all the paintings white, you’ll be able to see the paintings better.” He crosses his arms in the way he used to and puts one hand up to his mouth and does the thing he used to do - stop and think and nod for a little bit. Then he moves out of the picture. Now my mom is front and center. We’re in the same space, but now the space has transformed and it’s hers. So my dad is there, but it’s not his space anymore. She has work to do. She always had work to do when we were growing up. There’s a computer on a desk that’s now in this space and piles of paperwork. But she also has piles of makeup. She says, “Oh I have to get to a trial. Doyou think you can help me look good for this trial?” When I was growing up, I always thought my mom did her makeup so shitty because she never changed the way she did it from the 60s - weird blue eyeshadow and clumpy mascara. She just didn’t have a lot of skill with her makeup. So in the dream, she’s asking me to do it, because she knows I know how to do makeup. I’m looking at all this makeup she has. She has ten or twelve of the exact same eyeshadows and lip creams and all these things she wouldn’t wear because they are way too bright - they’re not the right color. She also has this makeup brush I need to use. So I put all this foundation on her face to smooth out her skin. It’s thick and way too much. I’m like, “Mom, if you’re going to have me do this, y0ou need to trust me and let me rub this in.” So I take this brush and I’m trying to rub it in. She’s sort of fighting me about it and I’m getting exasperated. I say, “Stop, let me do this. You asked me to do this. Stop.” My friend Darisu is there and he’s like, “Yes, let her do this. You’re going to have to trust her to rub the makeup in.” I finally get her face to be a blank slate with all the foundation. It takes a while with this one brush. In the meantime I ask her why she has twelve of this one compact. She looks at my dad and says, “Well, he was trying to order me a surprise, but he ordered like twelve of them and now I have twelve of these things I never use.” In my head, I think, “That was always your relationship. He was always trying to do nice, kind things for you, but he got it wrong by just a little bit. It would have been lovely if he had ordered the right amount and the right shade of these compacts, but instead he ordered twelve of a color you can never use. But instead of you communicating to him that you didn’t like that, you just got annoyed with him, rolled your eyes and totally disrespected him.”In the dream, I’m watching that dynamic play out. I want out of it. It’s not my business. I can tell it’s them. I was thinking it was just her normal hoarding habits, but it turns out it came from my dad, at least in this aspect of the dream. We go to where her eyeshadows are because it’s time for me to do her eyes. She has a ton of different colors. I know that is actually her. In this part, she just wanted all of these things for herself. So I pick out an eyeshadow. What’s fascinating is I pick out this blue that is dark blue glitter, drag queen style. She’s looking at me and I’m like, “Just trust me.” So I goto put it on and she keeps flinching and moving out of the way. Dorian tells her, “You have to hold still. You have to trust her. Let her do this.” In the meantime, I’m concentrating so hard to put this eyeshadow on her and make her look nice, I get the sense that we’re running out of time because she has to hurry up and get to the trial. There’s also a part when we had gone into the house, there were a couple of cats. These cats are small like house cats but their fur looks like a cheetah - wild cats - and there’s one here. I’m talking to it and looking at it. It’s talking back as a sentient guide in this dream. It’s acting like a human. It’s got a pink underlayer. It’s fur is almost holographic, so it turns pink when it moves, but it still has the cheetah spots. I look up and there’s this cat print or motif in this attic/annex that she’s in that has all her makeup, work desk and other stuff. It’s very striking to me, because at one point in the dream, the cat wants to be held. I’m holding and petting it, but it’s purring and chewing on my finger and telling me stories. When I’m doing my mom’s makeup, I see this cat print everywhere - on the pillows, the wall, upholstering of a chair. She’s wearing some, too. I finally finished with her makeup and am not sure if this looks good because she wouldn't let me do it the way I wanted to do. But she’s gotta go. She says thank you and goes off to the trial. Then the dream changes completely and I’m with a friend. She’s a business coach. She takes me to one of her client’s houses and her client is doing quite well and so is the client’s husband because they live in a really nice house. I can see the ocean out of the windows and off the balcony of their house. The inside is very modern looking and minimalist, so there’s not a lot in it in contrast to my parents’ house. There are beautiful wood floors and tall walls with tall windows. The walls are painted grey and the furniture is black. It’s all elegant, very understated and minimalistic. There’s a gathering of people because this woman is telling her story of how she got to be a wealthy business woman. I’m in the audience. She talks about how hard she works and how she couldn’t have done it without my friend who is the business coach. Then the business coach says, “Why don’t you talk with Cinnamon?” So now I’m talking with this woman and her husband. They want to know what I do and how I got to what I’m doing. I tell the whole story of all the different aspects of my life that came together to this point of where I’m a priestess who helps people be in their bodies and how that happened through me getting a degree in exercise science and nutrition. She says, “Oh, your story is very similar to mine. The only difference is I’m making a ton of money.”I look at her and am like, “Yup, I just haven’t cracked that money thing yet. Haven’t figured that out.” My coach is like, “Well, that’s why I’m having you meet her and tell the story because i wanted you to see how exactly similar the two of you are. You could do it at any point.” The husband was listening to the story and very supportive. Both of them are people of color. She may be Asian and he could maybe have some Arab blood. In the meantime, I can hear and see the ocean. It’s gotten stormy outside and there’s whitecaps on the water. But even though the house is very close to the edge of the water, I feel safe. I’m not too worried about the water coming up, but I can see it spraying up on the windows, which is very interesting. There’s a seagull outside trying to find a place to nest and land out of the wind. This is happening while she is telling her story and I am telling my story. Then at some point, I am sitting down. There is a sense of magic in this dream - as if these two people are my guides or my guides are orchestrating it or there are guides in the audience. I turn from our conversation and to a computer. That’s where I’ve been having conversations with other people. I look at the screen and see my friend Maria. She and I are having a flirtation through the computer screen. I can’t remember all the things we said, but I get the feeling of space and distance between us that is happening in real life - we are no longer friends in real life. I’m asking her, “Where are you? Why aren’t we friends? Why aren’t we hanging out together?” I don’t remember her response. Also, somewhere in the dream, I’m having a conversation with my dad and he’s talking about Doug who is a guy who used to work for my mom. They have a condo that they bought together with somebody else. My dad keeps saying that Doug owes him money for the condo. I keep saying, “Nobody has any money. What are you going to do about it?” My dad says, “Well the option has always been that he can pay money or do somworktrade to live there and his roommate can pay money.” I find it interesting that work trade is on the table as an option for living in this condo.",Rose,last_nights_dream
513,1350,,16/04/2020,04/16/2020 00:05,"“The Swan Costume” In this dream, I’m in Spain, I think. It’s a warm balmy country and although I don't see the ocean, I feel it in the air. The place I’m in is a palazzo. Everything is made of stucco -hardened and painted these warm brilliant colors like deep red and deep orange. The floor is also made of the same thing, but it’s painted a deep grey. IIn this dream I am Spanish. My skin is darker, my hair is a dark brown. I work as part of a family and with my family in this palazzo. My father is a police officer. He’s investigating some kind of credit card crime. He has stolen credit cards tucked into a book that’s like a photo album that closes with a zipper and is leather. Sometimes he asks me to get it and move it from its secure location up to where he is because he is missing some aspects of this case. The other thing I do is I get him some other materials. It’s like he’s training me to be an investigator. So I do this running around the palazzo in different rooms on different floors for him. Then at one point, in the dream, it deviates. I’m in a different country. I'm a different person. I’m in a kitchen scene where I’m trying to get my sibling to help me with the dishes. There are two sinks - one on an island and one on a counter. There are piles and piles of dishes. My sibling keeps only washing one dish then sitting down on the floor. I keep washing 50 then turning around and there’s only 1. My sibling is supposed to be doing this at the island and I’m supposed to be doing this at the other sink. Then I’m putting them away in a pantry in a slightly different room around the corner. At one of these times in the pantry, I have a plant. It just suddenly appears in my hand. I’m trying to figure out where it goes in the pantry. I open up a cupboard and it has all these wooden slats that would be part of blinds - like the California shutters you close over your windows. It’s a historical chronology of the evolution of a slat of a blind. I think, “Oh, that’s kind of interesting.” I look at it. I have the plant in the other hand. I think, “Hmm, now the seeds from the plant are gone.” I’m moving the slats on the shudder in a cupboard and it’s chafed the seeds out and collected them. So I close the cupboard board and put the bare plant on the counter. I turn around and now there are more dishes on the island. My sibling is doing nothing. I speak sharply to him. I refresh the water in the sink and put the plug back in. I notice that there’s 4 inches of unwashed cutlery in the bottom that he's been pretending to do. I speak sharply to him about that. Then I do some of it myself, but am thinking that if I keep doing this myself, he’s never going to learn to do it. So I put fresh water in then turn the tap off and tell him he needs to do his work if he’s ever going to get out of the area. I go back and finish my own. I’m disgusted in the dream by the sludge in the bottom of the sink and the pile of food bits and organic waste in the plug that I have to pluck out and dump. The dream flips back to the other scene where I’m in this palazzo in Spain. Now, the day has progressed and it’s almost nighttime. My father’s gone. I don’t know where he is. I’m suddenly supposed to be helping these people find costumes for a masquerade. They come in and I’m at the end of the palazzo. There’s a really long bar of clothing hanging from it. People are coming in one at a time, saying what they want to look like. I go through the clothes hanging from the bar and I hand them one and they just walk away with it. It’s not a line up and not a popular thing. I start to look through the clothing. I become absorbed by the feel of the material. The satins are really dark, the black is really inky and they feel smooth under my fingers. Then this woman comes up. She says, “Do I have something that will make her have a more shapely butt?” I think, “I don’t know.” I start looking through the clothing and I find something. She says, “How do I use this?” Now I’m wearing black gloves. As I’m looking through, the knowledge comes to me and I say, “You put this part on and it pushes your low back down into your butt, which loosens the skin a bit. Then you put this part on and it pushes from the hamstrings up to fill it.” Then I warn her that it says on the tag to be very careful because this can be hard or dangerous for your low back. Then there’s a costumed part that goes around the upper body. It kind of looks like a man’s lapel from a suit. So she takes it anyway and walks away. Then I’m concerned about this. I go to try and find the mother - she’s not my mother, she’s just another part of the family that works there. I tell her that someone just wanted that costume. She doesn’t reply to my question. She says, “I have something I think you would really like. Wait here for a second.” She goes and gets it. It’s white. She says, “Here, feel this.” I feel it and it’s got form to it. It’s white. There’s a feathery feel, like the way feathers would feel on a white bird if you just ran your hand over the top of its head and down towards the back with the grain of the feathers. It’s not stretchy material. It has form to it like a ballet dancer’s costume. She says to go try it on. As I do this, I see her nephew come in. He’s a man. He sees me holding that in my hand. Then he looks down. I feel there’s some kind of disapproval and also some attraction in his eyes. I go into the bathroom and put it on. I make sure I go into the small bathroom only made for only one person because I don’t want anyone else to see me in this, but I do want to see what it looks like. It has a full length mirror in it. So I put it on. I like the way it contrasts with my brown skin. It feels really nice when I put it on. It has a little bit of weight to it. When I turn around and look in the back, first I notice there’s a bikini line on my body which is at odds with the line of the costume. The back of the costume comes up like a thong and there’s a big scooped part that goes up over my hips from the leg. Because it’s got form to it, it doesn’t sit on my body - it doesn’t cling to it. It moves a little bit when I move. I’m slightly concerned about this because it’s a bit big for me. But I turn around and it’s also got these four other pieces that are about maybe 8 inches long, curved gently like an “S” the way the downstruck in treble clef goes. They’re also white and they’ve got downy feathers around the top. I realize they’re to frame my eyes. They tuck in with little straps at the top of the costume quite nicely and stay there. So the one curved in sits on the top of the shoulder and it goes up the side of my neck and then curves again gently underneath my eyes towards the inside of my nose. There are two on each side - one goes to the inside of the eye, one goes to the outside of the eye. I actually really like these and I spend a few moments admiring the craftsmanship , the velvety feel of them and the way they fit over the top of the shoulders. I like how they feel around the outside of my eyes. They kind of hide the eyes, too, because it’s like a masquerade. Then I turn around because I’m concerned that the costume moves a little bit of its own accord when I’m walking. Now I notice I’ve got these really high white heels on. I’m wishing there was some carpeting on the floor because they’re quite slippery against the painted stucco and that makes me feel a little nervous. But as I turn around and check out the back again, I bend over a little and think I can't bend over in this and have anyone see me because you can see more of my anatomy than I want roving eyes to be looking at. But as I do this, I feel myself turned on. I feel that move from my body as I look back at the front view in the mirror, I feel heat between my legs and a warmth in my yoni that’s spreading outwards. I can feel the beginnings of an orgasm and this wakes me up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I jumped or fell back into the water and sank down a few feet below the surface. I saw the ducks swimming about and noticed that one or two of them were dead.

They will be invited to a feature release party. I see a friend arrive. She wants a table where she can see the entire cafe and all the people. We order our tea then go sit at our table to wait. After we finish our tea, we leave and get in a car with a bunch of people. My parents are with us. We drive to a slaughtering lot. I see a hide of a mother cow hanging from a hook - they milked her completely dry then exploded her. There are cows, sheep, pigs and goats on conveyor belts, packed closely together and lined up for their death, but they aren’t being killed for food or any other useful purpose. They are lined up from smallest to largest. We are on a private tour and I’m watching these animals going past me on the belt. There are horses, cows, then elephants. I’m shocked at seeing a big pink pig with tusks next to an elephant - the same size as the elephant. It’s depressing to see all of this. I continue walking up a ramp. I go into an upper room and see lambs and baby unicorns. They have IV tubes wrapped around their legs - they are either being poisoned or resuscitated, I cannot tell. They do look sickly. Someone comes in and says, “Oh, you’ve found the babies! I hope you are enjoying your tour!” I’m watching as these clusters of unicorns play together, but they do not look well. I walk out the door and down a ramp. I am looking out over the whole lot. It’s unusual and depressing. Then I see these huge crystal geodes that are partially submerged in the ocean - they’re purpose is to be amphitheaters for shows. We have each been assigned one to represent our energies.

She asks me if I can move it. I apologize and say, “Yeah, I’m trying to go through all this.” Then I ask her what stuff she’s talking about. I look at it and the stuff she’s talking about is gold whiskey decanters. They’re all different kinds and shapes and they’re valuable and they’re all empty. People have given them to us. I never filled them because I don’t drink whiskey. I didn't throw them away because they were gifts. Some of them I haven’t even looked in. So she’s indicating them. I pick them up. These ones are squares - six squares made of gold with rings on the top that you pull on and the decanter slides up out of the square gold carrying case. That’s when I notice they’re empty. Then I realize that he’s taken some of them, but only the ones that had whiskey in them. So I think, ”What am I going to do with all these?” Then I open the door and in the hallway, some sales rep from a whiskey company has set up a display of different kinds of whiskey. I think, “Hmmm, I wonder if I can just set all the decanters up there when they’re not looking and they'll just think it’s part of the display.” So, now I’m busy with that.

522,1352,,17/04/2020,04/17/2020 00:07,"“Getting Ready to Cast Off” I’m on my friend Lynn’s sailboat. She’s invited a bunch of people to crew for her. We’re going on a trip. As is typical, if possible, people are supposed to get down to the boat early, unpack, get everything ready, then cast off. So I’ve got a small pack with my clothes and necessities in it. I go to where I’m sleeping on the boat and arrange everything. I unpack and secure it so nothing is going to fly around. Then we’re waiting because the wind has died down. We’re waiting for the wind to pick up. There’s a dinghy. Normally dinghies are just the bottom part of a boat. This one has an inflatable mast and sail on it. It’s really silly. I’m on this dinghy and it’s tied off to the middle of the ship. At first I’m just standing on the inflatable outside part. I’m hanging on to the mast and sail. It’s going from one side of the boat, around the bow, down the other side of the boat, to the stern, and it goes back up, around, and down. I’m just lazily going around and around like this. Then I think, “Hmm, I could actually fall asleep here.” I’m in danger of doing so. I think, “Well, I better not fall asleep.” So I lean back for a little and create a little resistance on the rope. Again it wanders from port to bow to starboard to stern and back. I do this for a little while. I think, “Well, I really don't even need this inflatable sailboat.” I twine the rope around the soles of my feet and I climb up it a little bit. Now, because of my body weight, I’m going around from port, bow, starboard, stern quite a bit faster. I’m starting to swing around it. The inflatable dinghy has now just disappeared - it’s not in the dreamscape anymore. I’m swinging around on this rope. I’m really enjoying this swinging part. So I move with the momentum, the way you would do with your body if you were on a swing. I’m moving with my core in order to get it to move faster, and I’m flying quite quickly through the air now. I start to laugh because it feels really good to do that kind of play. I do it a 7 or 8 times, then I can feel the rope starting to pull on the skin of my palms and feed. So I decide to do it just one more time and the next time I comes around midship, I’ll just swing in and land on the deck on my feet, which I do. I pull the rope in so it doesn’t get tangled on anything. Now I’m wondering what else I’m going to do. I notice that on the lower part of the deck, are two or three boxes pushed up underneath. I take them out and they’ve got paints in them. There's blue and orange and white. I think, “Oh those are nice contrast colors. Maybe I’ll paint rocks.” So all of a sudden, there’s another person who I actually work with, though I’ve never sailed with her - I don’t think she sails. She’s been invited to go on the boat. I’m surprised but glad to see her. I look over at what she’s doing to pass the time and she’s painting rocks. I think, “Well this will work. I wonder what kind of paint she’s used.” I kind of go up tentatively because I don’t want to interrupt her. But she looks up from her work and I say, “What kind of paint are you using for that?” She tells me that it’s an acrylic. I ask her if she brought it withher or bought it. She says, “No, I just came back from Michael’s Craft Store, although Lynn made a rather big deal about not wanting anyone to go there. She called me on the phone first to tell me this because they’re doing something that’s against her politics. But I decided I was going to go anyway.” So I ask her where it is and she says, “Here, it’s on this map and it’s marked with an X so that we don’t go there.” I look and I notice that closeby is a Dollar Store and they probably have paint. I don’t want Lynn to know I’ve gone to Michael’s as well because she’ll be upset. So I think, “I’ll just go to the Dollar Store.” As I’m walking to the Dollar Store, I don’t have any shoes. I’m in my bare feet. I can feel little stones under the sand. I start to look at the stones and see really incredibly ones - some shaped like diamonds, but they’re just stones and I pick a few of those up. Now I’ve got a bag. There’s another one that’s the same blue as the paint on the ship on the top. I think the bottom of that will look really nice with the orange color on it, so I put that in the bag. Then I look at some other stones. One has a fossil of some kind of feathery fish spine. I think that will look nice - I’ll paint the raised up portion one color and the background another color. I put that in the bag. Then I pick up one more. It’s got this funny symbol on it that looks a little like a menorah. I put that in the bag. Then I’m walking to the Dollar Store. I go in, find paint and paintbrush, and put them in the bag, then walk back. Now the wind has picked up. I stash my paints underneath the deck because I think we’re going to cat off. But we don’t! It’s quite windy. Lynn comes out and she says she’s been sewing something. She asks me if I’d like to make something. I say, “Well, I suppose I could use a cotton top because they stow away nicely when you’re sailing and they also hold the water so you can jump in, get wet, and they hold their shape and it’s very cooling. So I’ll make one of those.” So she tells me to go back under the deck and look for some material. That’s the end of the dream.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream2

We were at the top of the resort walking through some terraced ponds where ducks (or some waterbird) were swimming). The ponds were surrounded by concrete and were smaller than swimming pools. They were shallow and we either walked directly through them or on concrete paths. There was some interaction between myself and whoever was with me (mother or brother) and I ended up jumping or falling down to the lower terrace. It was 6-10 feet down and I was worried about it not being deep enough. I looked down at some white birds which I think were on an even further terrace which was longer and skinnier and more rectangular.   Across from the terraces was a long walkway directly to the edge of a large lake. We walked down it maybe half of a mile till we got to a cluster of cabins to our right. This is where we were staying. We dropped everything off and began unpacking We left later and went out to explore the resort. Later we went back to go to bed and while looking for everything that we needed, and not being able to, I realized that I was in the wrong cabin and had unpacked my belongings in the other one.   The next day we got up and walked back along the pathway to a large white building on our left which was a petting zoo of sorts. I went up to the door and tried to figure out to open. It was also white but had a mesh of wires and a circular window. I couldn't figure out any opening mechanism but eventually someone showed me that it was opened like a castle gate, straight up by pulling up via the metal meshwork.   We got inside and walked further into the building which looked like a large warehouse with tall white and concrete floors. I saw that there was a small building in front of us which contained a men's and women's restroom. My mom said that she needed to use one and I did as well.

Yet we had decided to trust him and go to his house, though I cannot imagine why. His house was dirty and dilapidated as he had not been there for some time. He told us that the police were after him, falsely thinking that he had committed some crime. To escape, he had dug a hole in the ground roughly 4 by 4 feet in which he had created 4 large tunnels. He had gone through one of them and figured that this would throw the police off since they'd have to split up. Now he was back at the house and was preparing to leave again.

It was a small flip-phone and I was having difficulty pulling it up as I was mistyping or forgetting the name of the song. Eventually I handed the phone back to Evan and he tried to find it, but he couldn't either. Or more accurately he gave up in frustration. That emotion was clear. We gave up and decided that instead of bothering with this we'd go to the beach instead and go for a nice walk.   We got into his car where we joined up with my brother and drove to the beach. It was a bright and sunny day and the perfect temperature for a walk outside. We pulled up to the gate and office where we had to pay for our entrance pass for the state park where the beach was located. The woman in the security building looked into the car and told us that because of recent events (covid19 presumably) that only 2 people at a time could go walking on the  beach. I think it was then that I suggested that they could go without me and I'd visit the various shops on the little strip which we had driven past. But they would have none of that and insisted that we stick together.  We drove away and found a bar. We entered and within we saw two very large biker-looking dudes. They were heavy set with long golden curly hair which fell past their shoulders. They both had beers in their hands and were clearly drunk. One of them spoke to the other mentioning the percentage of water in his cup and how that was tied to him being or not being drunk or dehydrated. The whole question as to whether or not beer is hydrating or dehydrating. :) We went to the upper level of the bar where there was a balcony which overlooked the parking lot outside. It was then that we noticed there were cops positioned around the building. The bar was going to close shortly and the cops knew that the two drunk guys would be going out to their large black pickup trucks and attempt to drive home while under the influence. They would then arrest them. There was no escape for the bikers and they knew that there was nothing they could do for as soon as they left the bar they would be arrested.   One of the bikers came up to the balcony where we were, pulled out a machine gun and began mowing  down cops, focusing specifically on the cop car that was parked in the lot. His continuous fire on the car eventually caused it to explode killing the cops taking shelter around it. Then one of the cops, a large black man, flew up to the balcony and shot the drunk guy dead. Then the cop came over to me and whispered quietly in my ear, ""Please don't wipe me from the world.""  What he meant was clear to me. I was dreaming and we both knew it and he was asking me to keep him alive in the dream for as long as I could. If I had wanted to I could have woken up or written him out of the dream and he didn't want to die. I realized then that I was dreaming and that I and my friends didn't have much time left. At this point I only remember being with Daniel, Jared, and possibly Doug and my brother William.   I decided that if this was a dream, I should at least make sure everyone had a good time before it ended. I took everyone into a grocery store which was connected to the bar and we rushed through the store and began to fill up shopping carts with candies and sweets.

My breasts are engorged as if I haven’t nursed in a while and the milk is coming out so fast, it’s almost choking the baby. Then I’m with my parents. I’m outside on a street. There’s a curb and a bunch of stand up paddle boards stacked. There’s a bunch of water coming down the street. It’s flooding again. These stand up paddle boards are stacked outside of a store and they’re starting to float off. These boards are a product that once you use them for their initial use, they turn into something else, then turn into something else again. I think it’s quite clever that the people who own this store have managed to figure out how to make items with multiple purposes. So the stand up board changes into a tank for a toilet, which is super efficient and only needs very little water and one flush, then also turns into an indoor house plant or a decoration. I am getting the sense that the products this store is putting out are amazing because each product is 3 different products within one. I’m standing in this street that’s flooded, trying to restack the boards, because I think it’s important for people to get on board with a shop and people who can figure out how to be so efficient and not waste materials and provide the basics of what we need because a stand up paddle board seems like a good idea when the streets are flooding. Then, the dream shifts. There’s a lawn. I’m standing on the side. There are a bunch of people mingling on the lawn - mostly white people. But there’s a Japanese family - mother, father, son. They’re a little bit away from the rest of the crowd and it looks and feels like it's a bit awkward and they aren’t being welcomed into the crowd. But they’re making do because they’re talking with each other Isee the father pick up a pinecone to toss at the son, for him to hit with a bat or catch, like baseball. The dad is in a suit. Everyone on this lawn is very well dressed. All of a sudden, the scene changes. I’m at a Japanese baseball game - in Japan, Japanese players, Japanese crowd. They’re so athletic. I’m watching the pitcher pitch and the batter sprint. I’m taking in their very athletic movements and noticing how in American culture we’re very snobbish and don’t think that others are as athletic as we are. But clearly these Japanese players have major skill and are even better than our American players. I’m also noticing how attractive each one of them are. I’m like, “Wow! I should be dating a Japanese baseball player!” Then the scene shifts. There’s a Japanese woman with jet black hair, down to her butt, straight, shiny, gorgeous. She’s in a skirt suit and I notice she’s wearing a wedding ring. She has a clipboard and cellphone. She’s clearly very busy, runs a lot of things, is very important. She’s walking down a sidewalk under trees. It looks like she’s walking outside the baseball stadium towards the owner’s booth. I watch as she sits down in there. The dreams shifts again to something else and I’m not actually in most of it; I’m just observing again.",Rose,last_nights_dream
533,1353,,18/04/2020,04/18/2020 00:06,"“Spirit People” I’m teaching my group of yoga teacher trainees. One of them has arranged for a field trip. The field trip is three yoga classes in a row and they’re all different. She gives me the address and we gather our group together. We’re on foot. The address is an arena - like a recreation center. I wonder about this for a moment because it seems temporary instead of a quality class asI had outlined to her. I wanted qualified teachers with experience. But I don’t say anything. I’m just trusting her. We enter the doors, go up the hallway and it’s on the top floor. She says, “This is where we’re supposed to go - my contact is up here.” We enter in the doors at the top floor. The contact is an MC and we’re at a wedding. He asks us for some kind of identification and why we’re here. At this point, I look at my student who arranged this field trip. I’m waiting for her to speak up. So she does, and she says she was the one talking to him earlier and arranged for us to attend the three yoga classes. He says, “Wait here. I’ll be back in a moment.” So he leaves us in the room. Then he returns and says, “I don’t know who you were talking to, but no one is expecting you. You are welcome to join in the first yoga class, however.” The first yoga class is all the bride’s family. They’re all dressed in wedding attire. The instructor is taking us through a few postures - the way sometimes a vacation instructor that’s never been trained guides a group of tourists to what they think a class might be. At this point, I’m figuring there’s probably not even two more and this is a waste of time. Then, all of a sudden, the waiters are coming out and they’re serving food. They’re putting it all out on this long table. We - my class - know we aren’t included in the wedding, but they sit down at a table near the back. I’m suggesting we leave. But they’re just sitting there, unresponsive. At this point, I overhear someone from my group - they’re standing behind me - commenting on the brilliant red of this person’s hair. I look and it’s someone I recognize. I didn’t know her very well, though, and I hadn’t seen her since high school. She sees me looking at her and our yes lock. She recognizes me. I think I’d better get up, so I do. I go over to her and her arms are outstretched, so I give her a hug. As I’m hugging her and saying, “Wow, I haven’t seen you in so very long,” I realize in my dream mind that she’s dead. We don’t have a conversation, but I hug her and I feel her hug me back. Then she releases me and I move through the crowd. I’m seeing more people that I haven’t seen since high school. They are recognizing me first. I feel obligated to go and sit down for a moment. The first time I sit down, there’s a woman who I have contact with through Facebook, but I don’t know her - we don’t have any close conversations. She’s telling me that her husband likes her to drink alcohol. I think to myself, “Oh, that can’t be good and why don’t you say something...you’re passive to this?” Then her son comes up. I just know it’s her son - a boy about 13 who looks exactly like the husband. My only comment is: “I can tell whose son this is!” I say hello to him and he smiles. He starts talking to his mom and I use this opportunity to get up, say goodbye, leave them and go back to my group. Now I tell my group, “Alright, it’s time to go. We don’t have anything to do here.” So my group exits the building with me - back downstairs, outside, walking along the sidewalk, and then all of a sudden they’re just gone. I look down and I’ve got a ceramic flower pot in my hand. The saucer is part of the pot - they’re attached. I think, “Oh, this isn’t mine.” I know where it’s supposed to go, though. It belongs to this man who owns a store at the end of the street. So I go in the store with the pot. I just reach over the counter and say, “Hey, I think this is yours.” He looks at it and says, “Oh, I haven’t had those for a long time - a really long time! Thanks for returning it.” I give it to him. Then he follows me out the store with the pot. I’m at a stoplight and trying to cross at the light. He hands it back to me and says that he can’t accept it until I’ve walked it across the street and back. So the light turns green, I walk across the street. Then I’m waiting and it looks like he’s going to disappear back into the store and I’ve still got this pot I’m trying to return. So, I turn around and the street is a T-stop. So instead of waiting for the light to turn green on the one side, I run up the sidewalk and across the street on the other side because it’s green. Now I have to cross the street again to his store. The light is green and I keep walking, go back into the store and leave it there, then run out before he can say anything. Now I’m crossing the same street again. I go down the street and it turns into R Street. I’m walking into Mandy’s house. Near where the boots and shoes go, I see a pair of wet jeans with mud on them that looks like it’s been there for ages. There’s another pair over by the sink. There’s a sheet on the floor in front of the sink in the kitchen. I hear a voice coming from the bedroom in the other room. I go into the living room. I’m just hearing the voice and deduce that it’s her brother. Then, I go back to the kitchen and start picking up all the wet muddy clothes, put them in a pile and set them in front of the washing machine in a room off the kitchen. Then Mandy is there. She takes out a platter from the freezer. It’s covered with seran wrap. It’s a Christmas dinner that never got eaten. She sets it on the counter to thaw and takes out a half-eaten thing of cranberry sauce. I think, “Oh, she’s trying to recreate a Christmas dinner!” So, I ask her if she’d like some help and she says, yes. I go down the hall and there’s drawers - just the drawers, not the sideboard - of my own sideboard stacked in the hallway. I get out my own Christmas tablecloth and some nice dishes. I put them on her kitchen table. From somewhere, I get a full thing of cranberry sauce and put it in a dish. Then I go back to my sideboard. I open up the cupboards and get my two brass candlesticks and put those on her table. Now the platter has thawed. I put it on the table and it’s renewed - ready to eat again and not frozen. Then I set the table and her brother comes out of the room. He’s got hair like Mo from the “Three Stooges” but one piece of his bangs has been gathered together with an elastic - it’s lying down - not sticking up - and flush with the rest of his bags. I wonder at the significance of this small ponytail on the center of his forehead. Then my dream conscious mind realizes that he’s dead and she’s making this feast to try and get her brother to stay. I’m just helping. She, her son and I sit down at the table. But her brother, instead of sitting down at the table, approaches the table and drifts off. She keeps trying to get him to come back, using various pieces of conversation to engage him and they work for a few seconds before he drifts off again. At this point I realize that there’s nothing else I can do there. I leave their house. All of a sudden, I’m back in the rec center and sitting across the table from Omar. I look down and I’m wearing my own wedding dress. He’s dressed in a tuxedo and sitting in front of me. He’s talking to me about something and I don’t understand what it is. He holds up a champagne glass. I get my own. We clink them together like a toast. Then suddenly we’re in our bedroom and making love.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I’m at the door and talking about a book I’d like to show to Justine. Justine is waiting at the door with another book, but her face is partially obscured and I didn’t recognize it was her. We walk into the coffee shop and sit at a table next to the door. It’s drafty and I want to move to another table. I look over and see a big round table that looks like it has been prepared for us. There are pink frosted pastries at each chair. The frosting is uniquely created for each person. We move over to the other side of the coffee shop, but instead of sitting at the round table, we sit at chair-desks. Then somehow, I look away and look back and it’s no longer just a line of desks, but multi-leveled bleachers packed with a huge choir. People are dressed in robes.

538,1146,,19/04/2020,04/19/2020 00:02,"The felt sense of this dream is sticking with me - a panic from the coronavirus. I’m in my home, but it doesn’t look like the one I grew up in. It’s warm out, like Spring. The ocean is around in the background - I can hear it. My parents are there along with a dad and two sons who I grew up with. This dad was my dad’s business partner when my dad opened a restaurant. He was a chef and a referee for soccer. I’ve organized a talk because they’re trying to take away our rights. It’s a big community. What’s most striking is this place we’re having the talk is this open lawn - a communal area with grass, trees and shrubs - pink camellia blossoms - and white picket fences everywhere and white folding chairs where we are all sitting. I can feel how everyone needs to sit down and listen to this. I have an agenda and really wanting people to listen to this talk that’s happening, which I feel like I was a part of putting it together. My mom and dad are there and I have this feeling that I have the talk for them to listen to because I want them to grasp a point. I’m upset about something. The talk starts. Coronavirus is happening in the dream. We’re afraid we’re all going to be sick, but we’re wearing our masks, but sitting way too close to each other. People are complaining about not having their freedoms and liberties. The talk is going according to an agenda and people are wanting to say, “enough with this social distancing, isolating and taking away our rights.” But then Bob and his two sons come along with a bunch of other men and boys. They’ve all had the coronavirus and their mothers and wives have died. They’re up in front of us and trying to tell us what it’s like to have this and how devastating it is. Bob is saying that even though he and Sarah were divorced, Sarah came back from a trip to the UK with her partner and didn’t know she was sick. She was cleaning silverware at her job at the hotel before she came down with it and she and her partner died. Of course everyone who was at the bank where he had been and using the silverware got sick and some died and some didn’t. Both the boys got sick. They look pretty pale and wan. I hear one say it was the first thing he ever had to recover from. He’s not looking like his full healthy self, neither is the other son, and neither is Bob. They give their talk to all these people. There are a bunch of mothers in the crowd - moms with their babies and young children. My brothers show up at one point. They’re sitting next to me. I have my kids with me. There is so much community in this dream - people I know - and it’s shocking to hear Bob and his sons talk about it and see their sorrow at their loss. The dream goes from this outdoor area to a home. Part of the reason I was calling the meeting is I was protesting that my home was being taken away. Now my ex- father-in-law is in the dream and he’s trying to kick me and the kids out of the house. I’m like, “We don’t have anywhere to go and the coronavirus is out there.” Then Bob and his sons who’ve all had it (we’re not sure if they’re contagious or not) need a place to stay. My parents offer them our place to stay. My brothers and I are trying to set up a place for them in the attic. The confusing part is all of the different people that come in - sometimes it’s my parents, sometimes my siblings, sometimes my ex, sometimes my kids, sometimes my friends including one of my friend’s from high school, Nani who I haven’t spoken to since we were Juniors - she’s one of the friends sitting near me. All of these people I know are coming and going, and sometimes I’m talking to my dad and sometimes I’m talking to my ex-father-in-law. Emotions are swirling a lot and I don’t know if I’m mad at everyone or happy to see them or scared for them. I know the feeling of upset I have for Bob and his two boys is big. I’m so worried about their experience and I know the fear is real. But I can’t tell how I feel about all the other people that keep showing up. They keep coming and going and playing these roles. The last part I remember is being in this attic of a home and listening to Bob and his sons talking about what it’s like to have the virus. I’m making a place for them to sleep - laying out bedrolls and sleeping bags. But I’m aware that I’m not wearing a mask and should probably be wearing a mask. The whole time I should have been wearing a mask especially when we had gathered for the community meeting. I’m very concerned about it. Bob speaks eloquently about what it’s like to lose your loved one because you didn’t believe that the coronavirus was real. That’s what I woke up with.",Rose,last_nights_dream
539,1354,,19/04/2020,04/19/2020 00:03,"“The Road Trip” This dream begins with me in a car. My lover is in the backseat and a mutual friend is driving. We’re about to embark on a road trip. We drive by my kids’ school first. I want to check and make sure that they both leave and are on their way home to where they will be taken care of. So as we drive by, first I see my son. I wave to him. He waves back and walks in the direction of home. I know he’ll be fine. Then I see a whole lot of other kids - you know how kids at dismissal time come out in a pack, there may be a few stragglers at first and a few stragglers after the bulk of kids leaving. So we drive slowly. The bulk of kids is gone. I say, “Hang on, I haven’t seen my daughter yet.” A few more kids come out of the school, then I see her. I wave and she waves me over. So I get out of the car and walk over right to her. She says, “Mom, I have something you’ll need.” She hands me this really long sanitary napkin that has a tail at each end. She says, “You’re going to need this.” Then I realize I do need it. But I don't know how to attach it to my body. I go into the school bathroom and I put it inside my underwear. But these tails are so long and I’m trying to fold them in so they don’t stick out. I’m worried it’s going to travel. It feels uncomfortable and bulky between my legs, and I don’t like it. However, it needs to collect blood and I feel myself bleeding. I walk back out thes school, give her a hug and she goes in the same direction as my son. I get into the car. Now I’m uncomfortable and some of the excitement of the road trip has been replaced by the anxiety of this uncomfortable, bulky and insecure thing between my legs. However, I continue on down through the road. The scenery is flat. You can see a lot - miles and miles of flat. There’s a little bit of steppe at the horizon. We drive for a long period of time until we run out of gas. We pull into a gas station. While my friends are tending to the car, I go into the washroom. I check to make sure that this napkin is still where it’s supposed to be and it is. I’m still concerned about these tails. Now I’m wearing overalls and the back part goes way down past my waist. I look in the mirror and I can see the top bit of my underwear sticking up. I think to myself,”Wow, my underwear is really high today. Or is this going down really low?” I’m not really minding that, except that I’m worried about these tails. So I reach in behind and I tuck them down in again and I want to make sure that no one can see them. I get back into the car and we are driving again. The flat landscape starts to turn into what looks like a town. My friend, the driver, says, “We’re almost at the theatre.” So we take a few more turns, get deeper into the town with more city scape. It’s quite old. The architecture, although I’ve never been there, looks Austrian - like a Hapsburg theatre would’ve looked like. It’s beautiful, intricate architecture. We park the car and walk in. The theatre has a giant arched doorway and as soon as you walk in, it’s got a hush where the soundproofing is perfect - you can’t hear any of the outside world. We walk down the carpet and we sit in the seats. I can feel the springs are perfectly loaded to absorb some of your body and they’re all cushioned so you don’t feel the spring itself. It just feels like you’re sinking into this hushed luxury. It’s a play. I don’t see any of the play in my dream. As soon as it’s supposed to start - the orchestra hasn’t even started yet - the dream shifts. The play is over. We’re instantly back in the car. Now I want them to stop at a gas station again because I need a different way of collecting the blood. They oblige. I don't tell them what for, I just ask them to stop at a certain place. I go in and I collect something that’s much more suited to my needs, go back into the washroom and get rid of the thing in the compartment designated for this kind of waste material. I put on something a lot more sleek and comfortable for me and securely attached. I get back in the car and we drive back through this same landscape. The driver drops my lover and I off at my door of my house. I go in. My son has fallen asleep in the living room on the couch. My daughter is upstairs in her room. So, my lover and I sit on the other couch. He falls asleep instantly. I have a cat now on my lap and am cat-paralyzed. I think, “Well, there’s nothing to do here for a moment, so I’m going to look and see if there’s anything on tv.” I look down and there’s two things that interest me. One is a show about aliens, but history. Another is about this magical realm. The title is in Spanish: Tiende. I choose one of them - I think it’s the Tiende one - and I turn on the tv and I watch for a little bit. But now I'm getting uncomfortable because I don’t want to keep sitting still. The cat jumps off my lap. I get up, go back into the washroom, wash myself, and tend to my physical needs. I’m still bleeding, so I tend to that. I go back to the couch and sit down. My lover stirs a little bit and he reaches for me and pulls me over. We engage in a long deeply passionate but slow kiss. I can feel how sleepy he is and I’m starting to get tired. So the kiss completes itself with some kind of acknowledgement that there is mutual sleep to follow. I go upstairs. He’s back asleep on the couch. I get into bed and then wonder if he’s going to get cold when he wakes up. There’s no blanket down there. So I go into the spare room, get one of the blankets to cover him with it. When I go back downstairs, he has removed all his clothing. I cover him up. He says to me, in Spanish, now that I have come down with a blanket he has taken his clothes off. He says, “Como?” Then he falls back to sleep. I go back upstairs and that’s when I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

He was shocked at my presence because apparently this never happens, someone just arriving in Asgard without being called or brought there. ""I found my way..."" was all I answered, and Thor appeared and was strong and handsome (totally rugged beard type - my jam) and I looked down and was dressed in the traditional garb of Asgard, with white flowing dress, gold jewels and long locks in my hair, like a Greek goddess I shimmered in the light of Asgard. In the distance I could see a very advanced civilization, a combination of spirituality and technology and nature, all in harmony. And Thor reached down and gently lifted my chin toward his face, and kissed me… and I woke up in my bed. It felt so real, like I was actually there, like Asgard in not a Myth, but exists in the current universe, light years away, and it's as if I traveled the Bifrost (Rainbow Bridge, Time Portal, Stargate) to the home world/planet of Asgard, which is part of the original 9 worlds (or the Tree of Life).

I’m with another man, I think it’s my ex, but I’m not clear. We’ve just experienced something that took a lot of energy. We have backpacks on. I think we need to get somewhere. We’re hiking to this place and there’s definitely a lot of traveling. We’re walking down roads and through towns. My younger brother is getting tired. As he gets more tired, he gets younger and younger. At some point, my ex drops off - he can’t keep going. I’m yelling at my younger brother that he needs to keep going. I don’t know what the urgency is and I don’t know where we’re going. I just know that we need to keep going. At this point, we’ve walked into a Waldorf school. My little brother collapses. As he’s regressed in age, he now looks like my son - somewhat of a transformation. It’s an open area where the kids are all playing. My son is now 8 or 9, maybe a little younger. He’s crying and he can’t keep going. I’m telling him we have to keep going. A teacher comes over. She looks like one of the nannies I grew up with, Sylvia. She had curly blond hair and looks Scandavian with rosy cheeks and pale skin. She comes over and starts talking to my brother/son. She’s telling him it’s okay. I say, “Okay you can have a short rest and then we’re getting back to it.” She comes over and talks to him. I get really pissed and am like, “What the fuck are you doing? Don’t coddle him.” He’s just breaking down completely. Her voice is soothing and nurturing. I can see that that’s what he needs. It finally dawns on me that he does have to stop. He can’t keep going. There is a sense of danger which is why we were moving so much. But he just can’t. He’s done. She’s speaking to him soothingly. I am being a total bitch and raging at both of them telling him he has to keep going and telling her to shut the fuck up. Then she turns to him and speaks to him in another language. I don’t understand it, but he does. I see him calm down - he stops crying and shaking. When I look at her again, it dawns on me that he has to stop and she can help and nurture him. I probably need to stop and rest, too, but I have to keep going. The dream shifts. I’m with a woman but I’m not sure who it is. We’re walking. There’s a big large screen tv. I sit down in a chair and look at the tv. I can’t tell where we are or what’s around us. All I can see is the tv. It says, “For black folks only.” I’m like, “Oh, that’s interesting.” But I go ahead and turn the tv on. It’s Will Smith’s face live. He sees it’s a white woman and he says, “What part of the sign did you not get?” He’s incredulous, exasperated and annoyed that I couldn’t follow the directions. In my mind, I think, “I just wanted to see what this was.” But I’m totally being disrespectful. Then my friend and I get in a car. There are a couple other people with us now. We’re racing because now it looks like city streets and a multiple 3 or 4 lane road and skyscrapers on either side. There are trees planted in the medium and they’re green, so it’s Spring or Summer. It’s warm out. Cars around us have their cars down, like convertibles. We’re kind of racing. We’re going to a place. College students and black people are in cars around me. Again I feel like I’m not supposed to be there. I was not invited. We race until I’m out in front. The scenery changes from city to ocean and beach. Now I’m with these white college kids. We get out at the beach. They all have backpacks on because they’re going to camp there. I’m not invited to that either. At this point, I’m an observer watching.

I then turned around in the aisle and found William standing there. He looked like something was wrong and I (and James) began speaking to him about the difficulties of being transgender. James left and William and I walked out of the church together continuing the conversation. William's transgenderism was taking place in a video game that he was playing where you could obtain different personalities, and so the question turned to how difficult it was to change that personality. We were outside of the church and approaching William's van in which he had his gaming server. He explained that it really wasn't that difficult to change personalities and all he had to do was apply a production patch and reboot the server and that it didn't cause any issues. He got in the van and left.  I walked back out to the drop-off overhang in front of the church and ran into Aiden who was holding a cup of some liquid (apple juice I think, but possibly coffee) and was going to see if I could get a ride with him. He was on the phone though, and so I didn't get a chance to speak with him. I also saw his umbrella in a rack out front to the right side of the door.  I walked back inside of the church to look for others who might be able to give me a ride. I didn't find any rides, but I went down a hallway on the left in search for a restroom. I spoke with one of the students there, for the church had now turned into Hogwarts, and he asked me which restroom I was going to. He mentioned that there were two of them, and I said that I was going to the older one which wasn't as nice but was more spacious and had a small office built into it. I went down the hallway and around a corner. I descended a flight of stone steps, opened another door, and found myself in the bathroom. It was large and spacious with stone floors and 3 or 4 large stalls each of which was the size of a small room and had walls on several sides. Each stall had a hole in the floor maybe a foot in diameter which was used as the toilet. All of the holes were filled to the brim with either sewage or urine and there was nowhere one could really use the restroom. The place was disgusting, dank, and creepy.  I went back upstairs where I found Peeves at the top of the staircase. He asked me if I had seen the secret room behind the staircase in the restroom. I had not, but as soon as he said that I remembered having seen it. He said that there was some creature which lived in it. I was afraid, but I was so curious that I was considering going back down to look for the creature. I knew that this would be incredibly dangerous. Instead, I went to Albus Dumbledore's office and waited there for a few moments to ask him about the creature. When he arrived, appearing to my left behind his desk, I told him that he needed to tell me about the creature, and that he didn't have much of a choice because if he did not, I would find out for myself anyway. I hoped he would tell me and spare me the danger of doing this by myself. And he did.  Dumbledore, who also represented God, told me of an ancient eldritch wolf which lived in the depths of the school and which had been using its magical power to keep the place running. The wolf was old though and would not survive forever. He then placed a very small dog in my hands which I pressed against my chest. It was the size of a stuffed animal and was the wolf to which he had been referring. Or it was at least a sort of avatar of the real wolf below. There was something very mystical about the wolf. I stroked the head and back of the animal as held it to myself.  After this, the dream transitioned and I was standing outside of the Hogwarts Express as I began loading it with my belongings. Hermione Granger was with me as were my immediate family. I was Harry Potter at this point or at least identified with him. As Hermione passed me to load the rear end of the train, which was really a car with a sunroof, she dropped her glasses. They lay on the ground and I was going to pick them up for her, but she gave me a meaningful glance and kept walking past. For some reason I knew that this exchange meant that she liked me. We were in the 3rd book and it was as if a narrator was telling me that in this series of events, we realized that Hermione liked me much earlier on than in the original story.  When I went to look at the rear of the car-train, I saw that there were a pair of square, brown glasses with some form of embossment lying out in the open. I figured Hermione must have had a spare pair. Everyone else was in the car, and as it began to pull away, I jumped into the back just in time. The gait of the car opened both up and down as with some jeeps, and I was holding onto the inside handle on the lower piece of the gait. As the car-train sped up, I was barely hanging on and was sure that I'd be thrown off. Eventually, I was able to steady myself and finally with some effort managed to clamber on top of the roof of the car and sit on top of the sunroof. I wedged my feet and legs in little depressions on the roof of the car so that I could steady myself.  At first I had to use my hands to keep myself steady and each time I let go I would almost topple off of the top. But as we traveled I gained confidence and was able to let go completely. I raised my arms triumphantly in the air and when I did I looked up. I saw that I was in a heavenly realm. It was a huge expanse of green grass extending as far as the eye could see in any direction. The sky was bright blue and dotted with bright white clouds, and off in the distance in front of us were blue mountains hundreds of miles high. It was truly magnificent.  My parents who were driving the vehicle realized that I was on top and stopped the car. This threw me off in front of the vehicle and sent me rolling dizzyingly through the grass. My brother jumped out of the car and came to me to fight. Not seriously, but to roughhouse and play act. I was too dizzy and could barely stand up to face him, so I rolled about and threw myself in random directions lazily as if I were playing around, but really waiting to regain my balance. When we did start fighting, it was as if we were dancing. It was perfectly choreographed. We were weaving in of one another's grasp. One of us would land a perfect kick to the other's chest and he would go somersaulting backwards. Or we would flip the other harmlessly over ourselves. We stopped because we were so shocked at how beautiful and well-timed our movements were.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

550,1355,,21/04/2020,04/21/2020 00:03,"“Dancing Shoes” I’m in a shoe store with two friends - Jay and I don’t know who the other one is. I’m there because I need new dancing shoes. There’s a pair that I’ve been looking at for a number of months. I’ve decided that I need to buy them now. They’re professional dancing shoes. So they’re black and suede, the toe comes to a bit of a point, there’s about an inch and a half heel that’s got a sturdy base and one strap that slings over the top. I tell the salesperson which pair of shoes I want to try on - there are a lot of pairs in the window. I let her know that it’s a size 7. She comes out with two different kinds of shoes. They’re both flat with crepe soles. I’m like, “No, that’s not the right one.” I indicate the shoe again. So she takes the flat shoes with the crepe soles and comes back with something that looks like a running shoe on a crepe sol.e The only thing they have in common with the shoe I’ve indicated is that they’re black. I say, “No.” I get up really close and I lean over as far as I can and I lengthen with my arm and my finger and that’s as close as I can get to the shoe and I’m still about 4 inches from it. I say, “This one.” She says, “Oh I know the one you mean.” I explain that it’s for dancing and you can’t dance in crepe soles because they stick to the floor. She says, “Oh yes, yes,” then goes into the back area and again and comes out with something completely inappropriate. I’m trying to explain to her what a dancing shoe is. She says, “Oh, I think we’re out of that one.” This time I follow her into the place where the shoes are. She takes what looks like a long hem of a sweater with hundreds of button holes that are only about a couple centimeters apart and inside each buttonhole is a tiny dime-shaped piece of metal with a number on it. So she’s looking up the name of the shoe on a piece of paper and looking at the coordinating number, then referencing the coordinating number with the buttonholes that have the same numbers, then if there is a corresponding dime in the buttonhole, then the shoe is in stock. She looks up the pair I want and that buttonhole is empty. I say, “Why didn’t you just tell me you’re out of them?” She just doesn’t seem to understand and doesn’t reply. She says, “Well, we haven't had them in stock for quite some time.” Then I say, “Well, why do you have them in your display window?” She says, “I don’t know.” I ask her if there’s another store in the city because this is the only store that carries dancing shoes to my knowledge. She says there’s one in a neighboring town. She could call if they have some. She does and they don’t. I leave the store disappointed. I leave the mall. I go out and sit on the front steps and I get out my phone and I put dancing shoes in the search bar and hit Go. There is another store. It’s across town. So now I’m looking up the TTC transit system so I can get there. It looks like there’s no connecting transit that will take me to that store. So I go part way there, then I get out and start to wander around. I’m wandering around the city. I get the impression that I’ve never been here before. So I’m looking to see what they have to offer. I’m looking for something cultural. As I’m looking, I’m sitting down on the front steps of some kind of building. I notice there’s a man behind me. He’s doing something where he’s moving rapidly. As I turn around over my right shoulder, I see there’s a dog leaning against the side of the building. The man looks like he’s trying to sneak away and I think he’s abandoning his dog and leaving it for me to look after. The dog looks really sad. I call the man and say, “Don’t leave your dog. Look, he needs you and you need him.” The man comes back and gets the dog and they leave together. Then I get up because I don’t want anyone else to think they can abandon their animals to me. I am just a visitor. I start to walk down the sidewalk. I still don’t know where I’m going because I didn’t have enough time sitting on the front steps of the building to figure out where I was going next. I come upon a college student, another guy, and a third person of color. This third person is wearing a jean jacket. The first man starts a fire. They all pull up fairly close to it and sit cross-legged. He starts telling the other two a story about society. He’s telling them that right now we’re living in a slow-ocity. The guy to his right looks fascinated and repeats the word, “slow-ocity” to himself a couple times. The person of color says, “Oh, slow-ocity, hmm” as though he’s considering it. Then above them. There’s a balcony of a two-storied building that is probably a storefront on the other side, but I can’t see it. They’re in a back alley. Two women come out of the door to the balcony. One’s just a white person and the other is a person of color. They’re both dressed in bathrobes. One of them takes off her robe and lowers it halfway to her waistline. She’s wearing clothes underneath. She starts to sing without words. The guy that’s sitting around the fire is interested in this. He gets up and resonsd and they start talking to each other. He hands her something - I don’t see what it is. She smells it and then licks her hand, then wipes her hand on the inside of her thigh. Then the guy leaps over the railing. Now he’s in some kind of regalia - it’s African of some kind. They’re dancing together. It’s really upbeat and feels sexual to me. They go off into the apartment and the other woman is still standing on the balcony. This leaves two people sitting around the fire - the guy that was explaining society and the other guy that’s fascinated with it. The guy that’s fascinated has a plastic bag in his hand now. It’s big, about two feet - like the kind you’d rake yard waste into - and has twigs and leaves in it. He smells that every once in a while. They finish their conversation and I wander off with the guy who had the bag of yard waste, but it’s disappeared and I don’t know what happened to it. Now he’s turned into Mario, a guy I know from high school. He says, “You can sleep at our house.” So I’m walking with him. He takes me to his girlfriend's house who invites us in. It’s the middle of the night now and her house is half cleaned. I can smell bleach. Half of it looks like a normal house that is fairly tidy and clean. It looks like all the junk from the first half of the house is stuffed into the kitchen and you can’t even move in the kitchen and the other half of the house, but she says, “Here, I have created a place on the couch.” She hands me a blanket and a pillow.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

He is upset and is looking around, wondering what happened. A man comes out with the paper schedule and says, “Hey, here is the schedule. You were scheduled to teach, but you aren't going to anymore. The class was bumped.” He wasn’t empathetic and he just walks away. My husband is angry because he believes in the work and was really looking forward to teaching it. I’m somewhat relieved because I didn’t think many people would come - the conference isn’t well-organized and most people are going to classes run by people with big names, mostly yoga.

I get a little distracted on my phone and am not paying attention to the exits. I end up going off a sideroad and am really confused. I see gates ahead of me - like gates to a cemetery. There are a couple people standing at the gate, wearing masks and long dresses. They open the gate to let me through. I drive into the parking lot and am wondering if this will bring me back to the highway because I have somewhere to go. I’m in the parking lot of a big public meeting place - like a town hall or general community center. I park and tell my husband and my son that I’ll be right back. They stay in the car. I go inside. There’s a gathering of people. They invite me in. I take off my shoes. It’s a church service. I sit down. They’re meeting here in secret because they can't meet in the big church without being found out. So I kind of like the message and it’s kind of nice to be there, but I’m not really wanting to be here. I also realize time has passed and my husband may be upset that I didn’t come right back. I tell them that I may be back and I leave. My husband and my son are playing ball in the parking lot. Then I’m in a scene with another group of people. We are outdoors by the river at covered picnic tables. They are preparing for a wedding reception. I don’t feel like I belong here. Maybe I wasn’t invited? They are inside now and I follow. They are doing dances and rituals. I leave because I don’t feel like I’m wanted. Then a patient texts me for an appointment. I make arrangements to see him right away. I am waiting in a massage room - it’s not my office as it is small and cluttered. I’m wearing tight pants - not what I like to work in - so I take them off to be more comfortable while I wait for him. Then he walks in unannounced without knocking. I’m sitting at the end of the table and trying to adjust my shirt so it’s long enough to cover me. He’s standing at the door and is holding plastic golf tees. He’s telling me about these specialized tees - some have gears to make them rise up or down, others are broad or have shelves to keep the ball from rolling off. He shows them to me, but advises me to be very careful because of the small moving parts. Then he lies down on the table and asks where my husband is. I say, “Well, you texted me.” He’s disappointed and says, “Well, I guess I can have your lighter work, but I wanted my husband. I just assumed it would be my husband because in the past when I texted you, you made the appointment with my husband.” He lays down on his back, and I tell him to lay on his left side. Then he rolls to his right side, and I say again, left side. I’m trying to position him this way, so I can discreetly stand up and readjust my clothes. He keeps talking and looking over his shoulder.

554,1148,,22/04/2020,04/22/2020 00:03,"I’m at a black sand beach. There are parts where the sand is fine and other parts where the rocks are bigger - maybe fist size. The bigger rocks are white and black mixed together. It’s steep where the beach goes down into the water. I’m in a truck with a camper on the top. I’ve driven the truck to the edge where the beach heads down to the water. There are a bunch of high school classmates and people from other high schools that I grew up with - mostly guys, but a couple girls. I’m watching them surf and I’ve got my boogie board to head out to surf with them. I’m a little freaked out because the waves are big. I go out anyway and catch a few waves. The part that is causing me the most anxiety is that I’ve parked the truck right on the edge where the beach starts to head down. I need to move the truck and I’m afraid if I pull it up or back a little bit, it will start sliding down into the water. So, I get in the truck because we are all done surfing and heading to a party. I’m asking for help. I don’t want to be the one to try and drive it because I’m afraid the wheels are going to spin and I’ll slide down into the water. Then I think I do get the truck out and manage to pull it forward but not without a lot of fear and some help. The scene changes and there’s a party going on. I don't remember much about the party, except that it’s all the same people that were there at the beach with me. I feel kind of like the uninvited guest, although I was invited. My own personal feeling about it is that I don’t really belong there. It’s a typical high school party with all of us smoking, drinking and dancing. I hated those. There’s a shift in the dream. I’m with this super tall dark handsome man - I don’t know who he is. There’s a professor and a bunch of other people. Now it feels like a college classroom, but it’s not an actual classroom. We’re in a building, and the professor is up in front of me. There is a string of lights - they don’t look like Christmas lights, the bulbs are much bigger. The professor is showing us the secrets of the universe and how light works and how we harness light and how the vibration slows down into matter. He’s showing us a very particular property of these lightbulbs that are also plants. This is where it gets a little bit weird. There’s a string or vine in the corner of the room that is also really open and not exactly inside. There’s a download of a lot of stuff my brain isn’t capable of fathoming. In the meantime, the professor is asking for different inanimate objects to illustrate his point. So, there’s a bed that a bunch of us are laying on or near as we are getting this lesson from the male professor. The tall dark handsome man is lying next to me. He is married - this comes up somewhere in the conversation. I’m like, “Well, I guess he’s off limits now.” But he is flirting with me like crazy. He asks for a strand of my hair to give the professor so the professor can show us whatever he’s going to show us. It was a flirty move for the guy to grab a strand of my hair and this flirtation is happening, even though he made sure to tell me he was married. I’m thinking, “I don’t really care about that if you don’t care and your partner’s alright with it.” But I don’t know where this is going and it’s interesting that we’re lying on a bed. Then the scene shifts again. I’m in a gym. There are pull up bars - like the rack in a CrossFit gym. There’s a coach. We’re doing an endurance test of how strong we all are and how long we can do pull ups with correct form - our form has to be super solid. He’s giving us a really specific circuit - five strict pull ups, five butterfly pull ups, then a hang in the pull up position to hold for five seconds - and do as many sets of that as possible. I’m getting really frustrated with the bars they have because there’s not enough room to do the butterfly pull ups. I keep trying but keep hitting my back on the rig behind me. I’m finding this entire exercise incredibly frustrating. We’re trying to get through ten sets of this 5 + 5 + 5. I keep moving to different places on the rig to find a place where I can do the butterfly pull ups correctly. In the meantime, I’m watching all these dudes whip out all these reps. I’m so annoyed and thinking, “Oh, it’s just because men are naturally stronger than women in the upper body and I haven’t had a chance to workout or train at all and I’m doing this from a disadvantaged place.” The whole feel of this is really frustrating. Then the scene changes again. I’m with classmates at a dance party. We’re dancing on one of the many lawns of our high school - there are lots of open fields where we played sports or parked cars or hung out. It’s freestyle dancing and we’re having a good time dancing together. There’s a DJ. One of the girls - I don’t really recognize her in the dream - is dancing, but I can tell she’s not super comfortable. So there’s some sort of interlude. She comes back and we’re all dancing again. This time she has 8 backup dancers and she’s clearly choreographed and rehearsed a dance to do. All of us are like, “What are you doing? This is a dance for fun. You don’t need backup dancers to make you look better.” We’re laughing at her. She’s clearly put a lot of work into this dance. The backup dancers are all very serious with what they’re doing. All of us are like, “You’ve missed the point. The point is just to let your body move and dance and have fun.” It seems very odd in the dream.",Rose,last_nights_dream
555,1356,,22/04/2020,04/22/2020 00:04,"“The Beach Apartment” This dream starts out after something has happened and I have to go back and do this again, but I’m resistant to it throughout the whole dream. I’m having to go back to the beaches around Lake Ontario and I’m looking for an apartment. The apartment I’ve heard about belongs to someone who used to be a neighbor three doors down and I knew him from when I lived there before. I’ve heard that he has a basement apartment for rent. I make an appointment to go look at it and I walk in and am sent by his mother down into the basement. The basement is grungy. Immediately I don’t like it. It feels dirty and old. The apartment isn’t even an apartment - it’s one long room in the basement. The other two rooms have their things in them - for the grandkids. One says Crayon Room and the other room has extra tables and accessories for crayons. I’m not sure if the owner of the house is the mom or the son. The son’s got stuff in a third room. These rooms are all around the periphery. The center of the basement is open - not made into anything - and just has the laundry tubs in it, which are the older kind made of cement. He’s down there. He says, “So, what do you think?” I tell him that it’s too small, there’s only one room, I won’t be able to fit anything other than my bedroom stuff in it and I need a place for my kitchen table and a place to cook. And what if I have other friends over to study? There’s no place for us to go. It’s too small. At this point, he seems offended. I get the sense that he wants me to take the basement apartment, not just to be a renter, but he has a crush on me and it bugs me that he has an ulterior motive and it also isn’t even really a basement apartment. But that doesn't sway my opinion. I have my bag with me at the appointment looking at the basement apartment. The son engages me in conversation after I refused the apartment. He keeps talking and talking and talking and he won’t stop talking - the kind of talking where there is no pause between sentences. I realize that I’m going to be late for work. I’m waiting for him just to pause and take a breath so I can say, “I’m sorry I have to go. I have a shift that starts in 45 minutes.” I’m getting worried because it takes half an hour to get there and I’m not ready. He keeps talking! Finally my agitation and anxiety about being late for work is enough that I burst in mid-sentence of his and say, “Look, I have to go, I’m going to be late for work! Is it okay if I use your washroom? I need to change.” He says, no! I think, “Wow, he’s just doing this because he’s offended I won’t take the apartment.” I go back upstairs, say a couple of polite greeting words to the mom, then leave. I’m walking up the street. The beach area hasn’t changed much since I lived there. I’m wondering where I can go to change into my clothes for my shift. I see a place that’s familiar. I go in that door and it’s a house that doesn’t really belong to anyone - you’re allowed to go in and change. It’s maybe a public bathroom - there are a few along the beaches where you can just go in and shower and change. I think it must be one of those because it looks like it from the outside, but on the inside it looks like somebody’s house. I don’t know the owner. However, I go in, take a shower, quick quick quick. I don’t wash my hair, I just braid it before I go into the shower, pin it up, go in and wash my body. I come back out, towel off. This is great, it’s only taken 5 minutes and now I can brush my teeth at the sink and put on my clothes for my shift - just a pair of black jeans and the shirt that belongs to the pub and it has their logo on it. I’ve got my apron in the bag. Everything I need is there. As I’m brushing my teeth, then applying just a little eye makeup, two of the other servers, Carol and Anne, come in and are doing the same thing. They’re using the other mirrors in the bathroom. They’re quickly fixing themselves up. I realize we’ll all be driving to the pub together because we’re working the same shift. There’s another person in there, she’s a hostess, doing the same thing getting ready. Now I say to them, “So has it been busy recently?” I’m thinking to myself that we’re rushing around, scrambling for the shift and I hope I’m not going to stand around all night. They say, “Yes, it has been super busy.” I say, “Good that means I’ll make lots of money.” I’m thinking that the owner is going to force me to stand at the hostess stand because I haven’t been there in a while or worked shifts in a couple of years and he’s like that. But I’m scheduled for a waitress shift. They say, “No, it should be busy enough that you don’t have to worry about that.” Then the other person says, “Hey, I’m the hostess!” I say, “Yes, you applied to be hostess. That’s the job you agreed to do. I applied to be a waitress. That’s the job I agreed to do. It’s not right that he forces waitresses to do hostess shifts on a whim.” I’m thinking in my head that if he does that, I’m just going to quit and won’t let him do that to me. Then, we're at the mirror and I’m just putting a little eyeliner on and it’s not working out. Every time I try to run the tiny brush down underneath my bottom eyelashes, it goes on my cheek which is two inches below that. So I have to wet my finger with the water at the tap, wipe my cheek and try again. I do this about three times, then finally decide just to leave it. But I’ve already got it on the other eye. When I look in the mirror you can't tell anyway, so I think, “Alright, it doesn’t matter.” Now we’re all putting our makeup in our little bags and any other stuff we’ve used to get ready. The scene shifts and I’m in a basement apartment. In front of me at my grandmother’s dressing table is a tray from a jewelry store with rows of fake velvet that would display tons and tons of rings - like 50 rings on one tray. I look at it and think, ”Ew, this jewelry all looks slightly fake. It doesn’t look like real gold. It looks like some inferior metal that’s been dipped in fake gold.” One of the rings has flowers on it and a band. There's another that’s white. My stepmother comes over and says, “Oh these are all pretty. Which one are you going to wear?” I wonder if I have to choose one of these just to not offend her. So I pick up the white one and put it on the middle finger of my left hand. I say, “Oh look, it’s too big.” I put it back. Then I’m taking a really long time to look over all the other ones because I don’t like any of them. I think, “Ugh, which is the least distasteful?” Then my younger sister appears beside me and says, “Why does Freya get one of those and not me?” I think, “Wow, can I just give them all to her and then she’ll stop nagging about it. I don’t even want them anyway.” Then my grandmother appears - my maternal grandmother. I’m happy to see her. She’s past on. In the dream I know she’s passed on and I’m really happy to see her. She says, “Come with me.” She doesn’t say it out loud because she’s a spirit, but I just know she wants me to. So I get up from the dressing table and I walk with her. The place we're in has lots of people in it. We walk through the dressing area. Now it looks like the dressing area of a theatre. We sit down on a bench with a cushion on the top. I look over at her. There’s a shower door behind my back - the kind where you slide it open to get in and out of the shower. The door is closed. My grandmother and I are sitting on the bench with our backs to the shower door. Now there are a bunch of men. Some man comes over and says, “Hey” in an interesting way to my grandmother. I realize she’s a lot younger. She sits up a little bit taller and says hello. I realize he’s interested in her. I look at her and think, “Wow, Grandma’s kind of hot! She’s younger.” He asks her for her name. She just looks at him flirtatiously but doesn’t say. I whisper in her ear: “Can I tell him your name?” She doesn’t say yes, but I think from her behavior that it’s okay and she actually wants me to. So I tease her for a moment, “So I guess I better not say that your name is Grandma!” She laughs. I say, “This is Jean Renning.” Then they start talking so I think I’ll just let her talk and have this moment. I leave. I open the sliding glass door to the shower, but it’s not the shower. It’s the entrance back to where I was getting ready with Carol and Anne and the hostess. Carol says to me, “Are you ready yet? Geez, it’s taking you forever.” I’m like, “Yeah I'm ready!” So we exit out the door, get into the car, drive across the lift bridge, onto the highway and into where we all work. I check the schedule. The hostess goes to the hostess stand. I have a good section. The owner gives me a dirty look and I know it’s because I quit and went to go to some other job for a little while then came back. I think he’s going to do something to punish me for leaving and then coming back later. Then the night progresses - I’m taking orders and bringing people pub food and beer. Nothing happens that night and the dream eventually ends.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream1
556,1357,,22/04/2020,04/22/2020 00:05,"“The Feast” The dream is strange and hard to articulate. There are moments when I’m in the dream and moments where I’m looking down and observing the events of the dream. So it starts with being in a carpool parking lot where you're waiting for others to arrive and you leave your car there, then gather in one car. I’m standing in the parking lot waiting. The car with two people in it that I’m supposed to join arrives. I leave my car there and I don’t see it for the rest of the dream. I know one of the people in the car - my friend, Janice. She’s a paraplegic. The car has hand controls on the steering wheel. Her chair is behind me in the passenger seat. This car will only fit one other person. The other person is supposed to meet us there. We wait for a little bit and she doesn’t show up. It’s Lisa, a person I know but am no longer friends with. After we wait a little bit and decide she must not be coming and just didn't tell us, we leave and we drive down the expansive highway to where we’re supposed to be going - a wedding reception. At this point, I’m suddenly elevated above the car and watching it move along the highway. I’m not so far up that it looks like a dot on the map. Maybe it’s a birds eye view. I can see the trees. I can see the ground. I can see the roofs of houses - they aren’t that far down from my vision. So I see the car arrive in the parking lot of where the reception is supposed to be held. Then, I help get the chair out for Janice and she gets in it and we both enter into the wedding reception area. She’s sitting with different people than I am, so we part at the door. I find my seat. I’m sitting with this man. His name is James and he is the estranged brother of one of my closest friends, Maggie. He is an intolerant angry negative person. I wonder what he’s going to do next. There’s a series of platters of bread that the servers bring out from the kitchen. As they set them on the table, people start passing them to the right. Nobody is eating anything. We’re just passing these plates. At some point they stop being passed and are set down on the table. I look and the differences between the plates of bread are miniscule. Most of the plates are full of square pieces of bread - square buns. Some are plain. Some are glazed. Some have powdery substance. I wonder why no one is eating them. I take one off the plate. I ask James if he’s going to eat it and wait for his snarky reply. But he doesn’t say anything and he just takes one of them, takes a bite and sets it down on his plate. I do the same. I wonder who’s wedding this is. I look around for signs of who’s the bride and who’s the groom. I don’t like the bread. It tastes like sawdust and I only took a tiny tiny bite and set the rest of it down on my plate. I get up and start to wander around the table. It’s one long table full of people and there’s the sense that there’s other tables around me, but my peripheral vision is clouded. I can’t tell who’s sitting where. Then, I rise upwards again. I’m looking at this whole area from the birds eye view. I’m not quite clear what I’m looking for, but am just seeing cars coming and going on the highway. It’s the same thing every time. After a dream moment of doing that, I drop back down to the table again. This time I’m standing between Janice and somebody else at their end of the table. I’m aware that they’re talking, but I’m not involved in their conversation.I stand there for a few moments, then walk back to my empty seat at the other end of the table. Now there’s food on myplate. It’s an uninteresting selection of meat with gravy and mashed potatoes and carrots. I don’t eat any of it. I just look at it. I’m disengaged now from the feast and the people and the festivities. I see one other person I know enter into the reception hall. It’s a friend I’ve known for years, his name is Joshua. I go over to talk with him.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream2
557,1358,,22/04/2020,04/22/2020 00:06,"“The Praying Mantis” My friend, Randy, asks me if I want to be part of a housing project that is on an island in the Carribean. I agree. We arrive on the island and he tells me that the house that we are going to build first, the one we can stay in and it’s not going to be on the land, it will be situated on rocks where the water flows, just off of the land. So we get off the airplane and get into a jeep. We’re riding in the jeep. One of the people that lives on the island is with us. The scenery is flat and wide and it’s hot and dusty, arid and dry. We arrive down to where the housing project will begin. True enough, as we get out of the jeep, there’s land and it’s slightly marshy and there’s a dividing line with rocks coming out from underneath the crust of land. There’s a little bit of water and it flows out from the crust like a very small stream, about 6 inches deep overtop some flat rocks. He says this is where the house will begin. There’s a number of people that live on the island that are already aware of this project. They are present. So we start to construct the house out of cement. The cement needs to be mixed. It’s poured and then it hardens. The walls are erected with these 2x4’s. The men are doing this part and Randy has already asked me previous to landing to design a garden. This is something he doesn’t know how to do himself, but I’m good at it. I’ve agreed. So while the men are doing that part, I’ve got some large pieces of paper, colored pens, and a geometry or drafting set. I start to sketch out the garden, being careful to also sketch out the house first that is not on the land at all and is not supposed to be touching the land, but is supported by the rocks. The house gets to the point where I can now help with some of the internal construction. I notice I’m wearing work boots, socks, a pair of cargo shorts, a cotton top and a cotton cap that I’ve made myself. I’m doing small construction jobs and am working the saw. We’re beginning the internal part of the house - a covered kitchen and closets in the rooms. Now there are more people helping. I’ve finished my garden drawing, colored it in and added some vegetation. At this point, one of the women involved in the project has commented on what I’m wearing. I’ve promised to make her a cotton top and cap, and also show her how to work a sewing machine. This is going to be on a next trip because I don’t have any of these things with me. The sun begins to set. People are passing around some oranges as well as something that looks like beer. I accept some of the food and drink and sit in the lawn chair. Randy has indicated that he wants me to sit in between him and one of the other people that live there. So I do. He starts asking me to share my knowledge of the garden and what I know of finishing houses like this on the inside. As I’m describing this, I realize that this kind of house and this project is a house that has not been built in this way before. Part of it is that the house is not supposed to be able to be swept away by the water. Also, the water has started to flow over the area around the house - it’s like a dock, but it’s not. Although, I’m also starting to see that there will be small boats that can go up and down using the current of the water. They don’t have keels. They will be tied up to posts that look like angle irons that have been pounded down around the house and this little bit of deck. The house is really small - it looks like the size of a shipping container. You’ll get your feet wet when you walk into the house. I wonder how practical this will be for spreading things that are on your feet from the land, onto the deck, into the house. But I see that your feet are clean - they are washed by the water by the time you get into the house. So now the sun has started to set and I’m getting a little bit cold sitting on the lawn chair. I move to go inside the house. Now I see that Randy has stocked some things to the living room, which is finished to the point that the walls and roof are there. There's a rudimentary shell of a kitchen. He also has a stereo. There is electricity now, which wasn’t in the original plan. He’s plugged something in and is playing music. He gets out an album and I notice that it's Led Zeppelin, but it’s one I’ve never heard before. I think this is weird because I know all their music. He puts it on and I listen to one side and comment to him, “Oh this song is why you played this side of the album, isn’t it?” He says, yes. It’s the only thing I can recognize that sounds like Led Zeppelin - a little bit of the guitar. It sounds like Jimmy Page is playing something, somewhat in his own style, but an instrument I don’t recognize - guitar like, but not actually guitar. Now it’s nighttime, our flight is due to go back, the day is over and any work we have left will be completed when we come back next time. So we pack things up and get into the jeep to go back. When I get in the jeep, suddenly Omar is there and he’s sitting beside me in the jeep. He’s asking me about what we’ve done there. I realize that Randy can see him. Randy is acting strange, almost like he’s somewhat possessive or jealous of me and the relationship that Omar and I have. I think this is odd because we’re just friends. However, we arrive at the airport and Omar doesn’t get in the plane. Randy and I do, and we have a conversation on the plane. First he looks at my drawings of the garden. He has some markers - there’s a bright orange, deep red and brilliant blue. He starts marking up the areas on the drawing. He’s asking, “What can I grow here?” I tell him. He uses the red marker for that. Then he asks, “What are some things that will grow in this area?” I describe the kind of food. He marks those and draws in some things with the orange. Same things with the other area and he draws in those with the brilliant blue. Then he puts the drawing away and. Then he asks me about the conversation I had with the woman. I say, “Yes, I think there’s potential. I can teach her how to make all this clothing with the sewing machine, but I’m going to have to buy one to bring down there next time.” He asks, “How are you going to get down there?” I say, “Well, isn’t that included in my work?” He says, “No, you’re going to have to pay for your own flight to come back.” I think, “Well, that’s not what we agreed on when I said I’d be part of this project.” Then I think he’s acting jealous because of what I noticed in the jeep with Omar. That’s when I ask him about his behavior with Omar. He doesn’t reply to me directly. He doesn’t answer my questions. Now there’s this strange energy between us and I remain silent. When we get off the plane, there’s a gap in the dream. Instantly from the airport, I am now suddenly at Omar’s mother’s place and there's a summer gathering. It’s a potluck and a beautiful day out. It’s lovely to be in the family again. But I know they aren’t real and I just enjoy the day where it is. Then it disintegrates. I’m back in the project with Randy. I don't have enough money for the plane ticket and I don’t feel like I belong in that group anymore. There’s energy that is not what I thought it was going to be at the beginning. I’m reflecting on the day. I look down at my hands and I notice that they’re curled. The fingers are curled towards my wrists and they don’t look like my hands. Then I see that the relationships I had with the people don’t seem as authentic as I thought they were. Then I look at my shoulders and my shoulders look narrow and rounded. I think there’s something about me that looks insectoid. But it shifts and I’m thinking if I want to go back and finish this project. I’m torn between the promises I made to the woman who felt genuine to me and the now soured energy that I feel in my relationship with Randy and the project. But I look down at myself and I realize that my body doesn’t look like mine at all. I look like a praying mantis and I hate myself.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream3

We were barricading the building to prevent any of the zombies from being able to escape. We were high up on a balcony overlooking a warehouse floor where the zombies were being held back by grated metal fences. We had an important mission which involved going out to where the zombies were briefly and climbing up a hill to high ground. I'm not sure why we needed to do this, but it was necessary to keep the hordes contained. Shad from STU was behind me, dove headfirst into a large metal vat, and returned holding a knife which he handed me. We didn't have many weapons and were low on ammo. I and two of my friends descended from the balcony to where the metal grates were and where the zombies waited eagerly for us. Snipers from above were training their reticles on the zombies below to provide us with cover when ready. We opened the gates, slipped through, and closed them. We quickly made our way up the hill, but the zombies were after us. We had to squeeze through tight, square metal openings and while I made it, both of my friends were not fast enough and were taken down. I jumped up to the top where another balcony was and was able to scramble up as the zombies were clutching at my feet. The snipers had been a big part of what had allowed me to make it.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

I don't remember if I'd had sex with the man, but I joked about having had sex and how Ben Shapiro being a Jew probably didn't have much experience with that. In the dream, Ben Shapiro wasn't married and as orthodox Jews don't believe in premarital sex, this was funny. He agreed, and then discussed moving to Australia because of the growing Jewish community there. I then saw a picture in my head of a dining commons at a Jewish institution. It was in black and white and many old-fashioned young men were clustered around tables. One of them looked like a mix between Elliot from Mr. Robot and Fabiano from STU.

The zombies were grey and looked like fish people standing erect on their fins as if they were legs. There eyes and faces were positioned as if they were humans, but they were clearly cartoony and looking back were not fitting with the rest of the dream.   I dumped the vial of the curing potion into the water, and then we began shaking the platform until all of the zombies  had fallen into the water. As the fish fell, they began to turn back into healthy human bodies. The bodies were completely naked and the people were very confused as they came to underwater. Some were not coming to all the way and I ducked my head under the water with my eyes open to watch for people who were drowning I rescued some, but then a man who I did not recognize swam to me and embraced me overjoyed in finding himself alive.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

I’m younger, closer to his age, and I think we’re involved. I’m lying on the hotel bed. It’s almost like we’re trying to earn our freedom from a mafia-type organization. We have a chaperone, an older matronly woman who reminds me of my mom, who has the adjoining bedroom. There’s another man who comes in - he is the head of the mafia. He’s saying to the young man I’m with, “You have to prove your worth and your smarts to get out of the contract you owe the mafia for your freedom and ability to be with her (me) and to choose.” This is the part where I move into the observer role. I’m watching as this young man performs his first task. He has to orchestrate something where he can sneak away and not be caught. There are other people who are loyal to the boss watching him, on one hand to support him in getting away, and on the other hand to stop him and report him to the boss. It’s very interesting - an initiation and test where the people involved are both rooting for this young man and going to stop him at any cost. So now we’re outside the bedroom and I’m watching him in what looks like a mall or airport bathroom with lots of stalls and entrances on two sides. He’s in there and trying to grab a pair of shoes to be able to get away. There are lockers and in one of the lockers are the mafia boss’ shoes - a very specific pair of shoes, white and made of hard plastic material. They are very precious to the boss. This younger man is trying to get them because if he can get those shoes and the car, he will have passed the test. I’m watching him plan and be very sneaky and strategic. He’s thinking, “The henchmen patrol this area at this time, so if I time it this way, I’ll miss their patrol and be able to grab these shoes.” I watch him plan it and then he does it. The boss knows that it’s going down but is letting it happen. He’s observing this whole thing, because he knows the kid needs to prove himself. So the young man does get the shoes and rescue me from wherever I was - maybe I was left in the hotel room. We run off together and then the dream shifts completely. Now it’s just me. I’m in a room - it looks like an abandoned warehouse you’d find in the industrial area. There are a bunch of millenials, or maybe even younger, maybe twenty year olds. There are two groups. I’m in there with all these kids. One group only has a handful of the younger kids. They are very conservative, kind of in shadow and wearing darker clothes, and their mannerisms are very reserved. The other group is much bigger with all kinds of people - all skin colors, ethnicities, gender identities or non-identifications, wearing various states of clothing or not. It is literally the gamut of young people. I’m standing with this group. There’s not a lot of distance between these two groups, maybe 10 feet, but I’m definitely standing with the group with all the diversity. They’re really loud and energetic. They are essentially all extraverts. While I’m like, “Yes! I like being with these high energy sovereign people,” I’m also overwhelmed by the sheer amount of energy each one is putting off. They are doing what they’re doing, no questions asked. It’s surprising to me because I know how to shield my own energy, but I’m just being swamped by the exuberance of this group who is celebrating who they are. I love this and I’m very clear that out of the two groups, I’m aligned with the group that knows who they are and isn’t taking any shit. But I also feel I need a little space. In this warehouse, they’re dancing, jumping around and making merry. I’m like, “Ah! Too much! Overwhelm!” The dream shifts. This time I’m part of the dream and also observing. There’s an actor, Zachary Levi from “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” show. We’re in a room together. We’re sitting at a table and being served food in the warehouse. He’s been given a plate of rice stir fry and he’s eating it and thinking it’s okay. I’m tasting it, too, and say, “Yeah, this is pretty good.” But there’s this cream of mushroom or salmon chowder option available. He’s saying, “I like this one better.” He’s talking to someone who is the one organizing the food coming out on these tables. When he makes his preference, the person that’s been bringing the food out is really short and snippy. It’s a man chef. He’s not taking kindly to Levi’s preference even though he made both of these meals. Levi is just very innocently expressing his preference for this other soup. I’m mostly in the observer role here and not really interacting except to say once or twice, “No, I actually also like that other soup better.” Then this is where the dream shifts again. I need to see my acupuncturist. It’s not that I’m not feeling well. I just know I need a few adjustments and an attunement of sorts. So my acupuncturist is the person I’m going to see. I’m going to get needles and he’s also a naturopath so I know that he’s got some other remedies and things up his sleeve and he’ll know exactly how to do the attunement. So I go to see him and I’m in his office - it’s him and his wife who is the receptionist. They’re diagnosing me and I’m telling them my symptoms, though I’m not sick. We’re in conversation. He and his wife confer a little bit. She’s like, “Okay, I think she needs this.” The naturopath says, “Okay, so here’s this one room where you can get ready, then meet me in this other room where I have all the equipment.” In the first room I have to take off all my clothes like you do for acupuncture. But usually you’re in the same room and you get under the blanket. In this case, I’m in one room, take off all my clothes, then walk to the other room totally naked. I don’t question it at all. I get to the other room and the naturopath says, “Okay, we need you to lay down here.” Instead of a treatment table, it’s a black futon couch, like every college student has ever had. It’s not laid out. It’s in the couch position. I’m like, “I’m not sure this is going to be very comfortable, but I’ll lay down here.” I lay down and the naturopath starts to put little nodes connected to wires on me. I can see my breasts and there are nodes on my breasts and I’m clear it’s for my heart. I’m starting to feel tired. He asks, “Are you comfortable?” He’s finished and is going to leave the room. I realize I want a blanket over me. I say, “No, I want the blanket I came with. I brought a blanket that this hand-quilted. It’s all folded up and left it in the other room because I didn’t know I was going to need it. I really want that.” At this point, there are other people in the room, again these are younger people, maybe early twenties, maybe older teenagers. They’re observing. They are part of this healing attunement. I can see three of them and I get a sense that there’s more. They’re talking to the doctor and saying “Please do a good job with her. We honor her very much and she needs to be taken care of. Don’t mess it up or put any needles in the wrong spot.” They’re very honoring in the way they speak of me, like I’ve done things for them that has helped them, and in return they want to make sure that I’m taken care of. So when I ask for my blanket, one of them goes back to get my blanket. They end up getting the wrong one, but it’s okay. I’m slowly being taken care of. They find the heat lamp and put it on me. They put a blanket on me. They just make sure that while I’m having this attunement, I’m warm and have everything I need. I leave the office feeling better. I’m looking at this house. It’s twilight The feature of the house that stands out the most is a huge front window that is lit up. I can see the light in this gloom that I’m in.",Rose,last_nights_dream
574,1361,,25/04/2020,04/25/2020 00:04,"“The Study” I dreamt I recorded this dream, but I must not have, because my phone is still off. I am a doctor and I’m working in an institution. I’ve been called by the people who hired me to do a study. It requires that I spend 30 days in a jail. I have to sleep there. So I move from the medical end of the institution where I work down to the opposite end of the building. As I walk that way, the lighting changes from that bright fluorescent that is often in hospitals to darker. The hallways are poured cement and a brownish dark grey. The walls, floor and ceiling are all made of the same thing. But it’s wide. I walk down the hallway and I’m met by some other staff. They take me into the place where I'm supposed to be spending the next 30 days. I dress in scrubs and go into the cell where they are bringing the participants in the study - there are about 6 or 7 of them, and one is a child, about age 7. We’re all sleeping on a mattress that’s been thrown down on the floor. I’m feeling into their dreams and recording them. I feel safer because there is a child on one side. The child belongs to the other person on the other side, so I think this relationship is safe. The 30 days go by and each night I arrange it so that I’m in between a child and its parent in the study, so I get by. This one woman kept speaking when she was sleeping in what sounded like a foreign language. Every night she would repeat these words and I couldn’t make out what they were. I thought they were a foreign language, but on the second to last day of the study, I realize she was saying, “Ham and cheese,” and there was really only one place in the town where they served ham and cheese and it was this restaurant. That’s why I was supposed to meet my colleague there - we thought it was connected to the restaurant and were trying to decipher what it was these people had in common that would make them commit such a crime. At the end of the 30 days, I describe what I’ve observed in the study to another staff member, then I change back into my regular clothes and leave. I exit the building, going down the street, and am meeting someone for lunch. It’s another colleague.But the building where I’m supposed to meet them, as I approach it looks odd because it’s daytime but the lights on the sign are out. It looks closed. But as I get about a foot away from the building, I can see that the restaurant is full - I can see the outline of people in it. But I’m starting to feel a sense of foreboding in my body. As I get closer to the building, I can see that the people who have the table for two closest to the window, their heads are leaning against the inside of the glass and they look dead. I look in through the window and can see into the restaurant and all the patrons are dead. From the marks on their body, it looks like they’ve been shot and there is a blood splatter on the walls around them. It looks like every single one of them has been shot and it’s horrible because there’s a full demographic of people, including babies. I call on my phone and report this. I didn't call the police, though, I called the team of people I’ve been working for. I also get in touch with my colleague and say, “Can you please come down here? Something horrible has happened. You have to call the police.” So I’m standing on the sidewalk, waiting for that to happen. I’ve moved away from the front window of the restaurant because of the sheer violence and I don’t want to look at it. I’m just staying until help arrives. When it does, I start to walk up the street. In front of me is a building that looks like an old turn of the century middle school. There’s a sign in front that has a wheel, like a mandala with various colors. The colors are all pushpins and they’ve been placed there by me. I realize this is one of the earlier studies I’d done. It was a study of lawyers to see how honest they were, how much integrity they had, and how much they treated their clients fairly. I’m still waiting for my colleague to show up.I think this study was interesting, too, and I wonder how the study has progressed since I left it. The building across the street from the middle school with the sign is the place where I’d done the research, so I enter into that building. As soon as I’m in there, I’m back in the time when I did the research and I’m still doing it. I get out the stuff for the mandala and the pushpins. Now I’m recording. There are more lawyers since I first did the study and I’m making the wheel. Instead of just having the outside of the wheel full of these colors, I’m adding more data in, so it’s starting to fill in the inside of the wheel and the radii that extend down towards the center. What I find when I’m doing this is that most of the lawyers in the study have external traits and they appear to be good, so they’re getting some of those colors, but the part where they’re internally oriented to actually being a benevolent person, they’re not, so they have some of those colors, too. I look and decide that the study is worthless because they have just as many positive traits externally as they do negative traits internally. So, now I don’t want to add any more of the data and I exit the building and start walking up the street. As I walk up the street, I start to feel like I’m being chased. I turn around and see two men. They are indeed pointing at me. They start to run. Now I start to run. As I’m running, I pick up velocity and I start to float up over the top of the street. Now I’m just slightly above the roofs of the houses. I don’t want to get that high up. I want to stay in contact with the roofs. So I see one - it’s not a flat roof, it’s open and there’s an upper floor on top of the building. I think that will be a good one to land in because there are places to hide and perhaps they won’t see me. As I get closer to the roof of the building, I can feel the unsteadiness of not being grounded. I can see that it’s a workshop with power tools. I think this is good because I’ll be able to defend myself. I’m able to pull myself down onto the rooftop. I’m looking for something that shoots nails in case they see where I’ve gone and come after me, which they do. I pick up one of these machines and I aim it at the guy, only it’s empty - there are no nails in it. As I’m looking around at all these tools, nothing will shoot at them and they’re still chasing me. I figure there must be a fire escape somewhere so I run to one side of the building and there is. I go down one flight, down another flight, down another flight, and then there’s a floor and there’s a woman standing in the kitchen. I lock the door and say, “I’m really sorry, I’m being chased. Can you call the police?” That’s when I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

585,1150,,26/04/2020,04/26/2020 00:09,"I’m sitting at a kitchen table with my ex-father-in-law. I’m in a big house. There are windows behind him. I can see out to rolling grasslands, what I imagine the flyover states would look like with fields of corn. He and I are negotiating the house - essentially living arrangements and the mortgage. The house is the one my ex and I owned together with my ex’s dad as our mortgage holder. My ex is not at the kitchen table, and not even in the picture. It’s just me and my ex-father-in-law talking. Initially, he’s just a total dick about it and threatening to foreclose and all that. I say to him, “You can do that, but I don’t have a place to go if you do.” My ex-father-in-law says, “Yes, well my son already has a home and all the things he needs and he has the kids.” I look at him like, “Wow. Amazing that you have zero compassion.” Then something shifts. I don’t know if I say something to him that makes him reconsider or he just reconsiders. He says, “Okay, here’s what I’m willing to do. Sell this house, then go buy a smaller house. Whatever money you need to buy the smaller house will be there for you.” So, I leave this house where we are. My ex-father-in-law makes some suggestions. He says, “There are a few houses down the road a little way in this little neighborhood that might suit you. It’s small and cute and you might like it, so go look.” I leave this kitchen table and the bigger house. I walk down the road. The rolling fields change and the scenery changes to a neighborhood with the houses quite close together. It is an established neighborhood that has been there for a while because all the trees and plants are so luscious and green. It’s definitely spring or summer because everything is leafed out and there are flowers everywhere and vines growing on houses. It is gorgeous and very alive with plant life. Instead of the ticky tacky style developed neighborhoods, it actually has quite a bit of charm. The houses were built individually with their own quirks and layouts. The house that I’m looking at is yellow, two-story, smaller. There is greenery everywhere. There is a road above and below, and a set of stairs that go down to the house. I’m on the stairs, walking down to the house, and I see there is a house at the top of the stairs. These stairs are super rickety and it looks like they’re held up by vines - not like cement stairs poured into the land, but wooden stairs that are somewhat free-hanging so they sway a bit like a bridge. On my way down these stairs and there are two infants who can barely crawl. They are tiny and they’re twins. One is falling down the stairs from this house at the top of the stairs. I’m fucking horrified! There is space between each step. The babies aren’t even old enough to crawl. One is actually still sitting in its carrier, not moving too much. But the other has sort of crawled out and is trying to head down these stairs, but essentially falling. I’m horrified that it will fall to its death. I pick up the one baby that’s falling. I look around for its parent. Its dad is sitting on the porch of the house at the top of the stairs. I’m like, “Hello? Is this your baby? It’s falling to its death.” As I'm talking to him, a pair of younger women, I think they might be in their mid or late twenties, walk by me on the stairs. It’s interesting because the stairs are not particularly wide, so it’s hard to get by. They don’t really get by. They stop and say, “Oh, these babies are his and he doesn’t take good care of them. You should take them. We’ll help you. We need to find their mother or a safe place for them.” I gather both babies up. The one that was falling shudders and relaxes as soon as I pick it up and hold it. You can tell the baby was so scared. This part of the dream ends with us going out to find somebody or the mother. As we head down the stairs, we go past this yellow house I was looking at. It’s even cuter close up and I think, “Yes, that’s where I want to live.” Then the dream switches and I’m with my ex-husband. We are in some sort of trial separation period. He’s gone off to live with this guy and I know he’s sleeping with this guy and that they have a thing going. My ex is trying to hide it from me, though, and I think it’s hilarious. I just wait for him to come out and tell me what’s going on. My ex still has my kids. I’m horrified because he keeps pawning the kids off to other people - the kids’ friends’ houses. I can tell our kids feel unanchored and untethered. But for some reason they don’t want to see me or aren’t allowed to see me. I get the sense that they don’t want to live with me and that’s part of the issue. They want to live with their dad because he doesn’t actually have rules and boundaries for them. So, at one point, I barely see my daughter and she gives me a nasty look. Then I see my son and he’s happy to see me, but he’s very preoccupied with friends and he’s riding his bike to their house. I ask my ex if it’s safe: “Do you know where the kids are? Do you know what they’re doing all the time? Can you get a hold of them if you need to? Do you have their phone numbers?” He’s very vague about it because he’s super-preoccupied with this man and this new partnership. We’re not completely separated in this dream. We aren’t living together, but my ex’s stuff is still in our bedroom - he still needs to clear his stuff out. I meet up with him somewhere at a park. He’s on a bicycle. There’s a white Range Rover parked on the side of the street. My ex says, “I want you to meet this guy.” I assume it’s the guy he has been sleeping with. I go to meet him and it’s someone I know from high school, Jon - a shorter Asian guy. I'm like, “Oh my gosh! Hi, Jon. How are you?” I’m happy to see him. It’s been a while. He’s all weird and squirrely and so is my ex. They’re still trying to hide it from me. I’m having fun at this point, making it more awkward, because they’re being so silly about it. Then my ex comes back with me to the house because now he’s finally ready to get all his stuff out of the house. We’re lying in bed. We’re both like, “How about one last screw to really make sure we’re really done?” I’m looking at him and am like: “Well, at one point are you going to admit that you like both men and women?” For some reason it’s important for me to have him know that I knew all along. He finally admits it to me, and I’m like, “Yeah, I knew this the whole time. Thanks for saying it. Okay, now let’s both have one last orgasm. Then get your shit and get out of the bedroom.” The dream ends there.",Rose,last_nights_dream
586,1362,,26/04/2020,04/26/2020 00:10,"“The Move” I’m preparing different areas for a move to somewhere else that doesn’t have a physical space. It feels like I’m hopping or transforming into a different time. I first go to a house I lived in where my daughter decided she was going to live with her boyfriend. The house is disheveled - half moved out and half not. I just ask her to sit down for a moment and explain to her where I’m going and that I’ll still have a place for her. I’ve got some of the things she didn’t take with her and still carry them and will bring them with me so there will always be a place for her to go to - there will be a designated space for her. I’m going to slide her bed up inside the wall, so I can use the floorspace for something else. When she needs her room, I’ll just bring her bed out of the wall and place it down on the floor. It won’t take very long. She seems happy with this, so I give her a hug. Then she leaves. I go down a few steps and cross over into the garage. The garage is bigger than I thought it would be and than I remembered it was. There’s a really, really long trunk in it. I open it. The rest of the stuff in there has no value to me - I’m not taking it. But I think, “What’s in that trunk?” When I open it up, it’s way bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. There are some antiques in it that belong to my grandparents. I sort a few things out from there. I remove a few things and leave some things. Then I close the trunk and I leave that house. I’ve got something else to pick up that I’ve been storing at a farm that belongs to my friend, Rob. I have to drive a different car to get there. Although, In a previous dream I’ve walked that really long expansive highway before. I’m not going to walk this time, due to lack of time, so I drive my car. As I get close to the road where Rob lives on the farm, I have to leave the highway and go off onto the farm road. I drive halfway up the road and see a woman I’ve only met once in person, but I’m involved in a project with her, electronically. I see her and she comes walking towards me as I pull my car over to the side of the road. I know I’m not supposed to park in the driveway and I’ve already arranged with my friend Rob that he will come out and meet me. So, Kem walks over towards the car and we have a conversation about farms, eggs and growing things. Although the conversation is really interesting, I tell her, “I’m sorry, I have to leave now.” So she just says goodbye and walks away. Rob has arrived and he has my grandmother’s vehicle. He says, “I’m sorry, I’ve taken care of it for you, but did not have time to switch the tires over. I don’t have the tools to do that anymore. You’ll have to take it to the garage up the road.” I say, “Okay, thanks for storing it for so long.“ I leave my car on the side of the road and get in my grandmother’s vehicle. I drive it up to where Rob indicated and as I pull in that parking lot, the mechanic comes out and asks if he can help me. I say, “Yes, I need the tires changed over on my car.” He says, “This is yours?” And I say, yes. He says, “This isn’t the kind of car a woman would have. They don’t know how to take care of these things.” I feel a bit of umbrage bubble up in my chest, but I don’t tell him . I don’t think there’s any point to trying to break through his preconceived notion. Instead, I just get out of the car, pop the hood, and do a couple things to the engine. I get the tires out of the trunk and say, “Are you able to put these on the rims and change them or not?” He looks a little bit surprised and says, “Oh, that’s all you need?” I say, “Yes. Can you do it or not?” He says, “Yes, I can do that.” So, I’m waiting. He says, “It’s just going to take me a day. Can you leave it here?” I say, “Yes, that’s fine.” I don’t really trust him, but because Rob says he’s quite capable, I decide to trust Rob’s judgment instead and I leave the car there. Now I’m walking back up the laneway and have some time to think before getting in my own car. I’m sifting through my mind thinking, “What else do I need to prepare for this move?”",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

589,1857,,26/04/2020,04/26/2020 00:13,"From the upper window of a palatial resort, I looked down upon an alien beach. It was sandy and dotted with rocks, but the strange part was there were flying crap creatures all over. One had to be careful with them as they were--made of crap and caused a lot of messes when they hit the ground or hit someone. There were also some other kind of creature and it was a 50/50 split between the two.  I walked down to the ocean and found myself underneath an overhanging rocky arch. The waves crashed gently around the rocks, and lapped in the archway covering my feet. I saw that a larger wave was coming, but I didn't realize how high it was. It crashed through the opening to my right and shot me through the other side at a dizzying pace. I was quickly approaching a rock wall and was sure that I would be dashed to pieces. I hit the rock wall, but not nearly as hard as I should have. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to get back to the shore before the next waves would come. I was sure I'd be trapped. But I managed to get back to the shore.  I walked up the beach and along a road to a little parking area where my dad was with my moped. I asked to ride the moped home.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

Somehow they had jumped the train off of the tracks and was driving it down the road. My car wasn't very fast and they were gaining on me, but I figured that I would have a better turning radius than a train, so I darted down a side road, jumped off the side off of a bridge down to a smaller road below and attempted to hide from them.   I slowly and quietly made my way to my base where I had a secret device which the bad guy were after. I'm not sure what it did, but it was electronic and small enough to be moved by a single person. We were by the side of a cliff at the edge of my complex where my device was being used to create a spider web down below the cliff and extending out several dozen feet. It had been daytime before, but now it was night. The woman was drugged or otherwise unstable, and began to fall. As she fell, she may have turned into a spider. I also felt at times as if the woman was me. I let the woman fall into the net and escape.  I left, and later Jared and Doug were talking to me and wanted to see my device. I had to tell them that they couldn't because of safety concerns. I was worried that they'd fall into the spider web as well which seemed to attract people toward it. I then copied my secret device code into C:/Open Folder, encrypted it, and deleted the old copy.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

Harold was there, as was Doug, and a few dozen others who I didn't know. When evening came, one of the guys stood up to make an announcement. In whatever world we lived in, almost all parties of this kind turned into orgies around evening. Everyone had sex with everyone else. But we were Christians and wanted to be different, so the guy said, ""Alright guys, let's have fun, but don't have too much sex."" At which point Doug who was sitting on the floor to my right, in front of a wooden table, protested as he didn't believe that anyone should be having sex before marriage. The guy decided compromised and requested that no one have sex with more than one other person. That seemed to appease everyone, and I began looking for a potential mate.   The next morning I left the house with James and my younger brother and as we walked along the driveway leading out of the gated complex, we saw a girl on the phone. She was talking to someone about her boyfriend who was being abusive. I wanted to go up to her and tell her that she needed to get out of the relationship and that there was no excuse for her boyfriend and no justification for staying. James also wanted to approach her, but his plan was to share the gospel and convince her to become a Christian. We both walked past her, but her conversation ended and she walked up to us a little on our left. James turned to her and asked her if she wanted to hear about Jesus. She clearly did not and without giving so much as a word in response placed her white headphones back into her ears and walked away.  We then got to the security gate where two guards stood. They had detained a man kneeling in the grass to the right of the gate because he had leaned over to pick something up from the grass. A terrible offense. We kept walking and were told to put our hands in the air so that they could be sure we weren't carrying anything dangerous, like LSD.  We complied and didn't have any issues.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

602,1151,,28/04/2020,04/28/2020 00:01,"Two parts to this dream: In the first one, I am with a man, but I’m not entirely sure who it is - it could be my ex, it could be another friend of mine, Josh. He’s very protective. I’m lying down on my back. I can’t tell where I am. There’s a mother ferret and six of her babies lying on my stomach. The babies are little and I’m protecting them. The mother is very content and happy to lie there with me and have me guard them. So I’m lying still. The babies are slowly growing - I’m watching them grow and am being very protective. The man with me is also being protective. I’m not exactly sure where I am - it seems to be outside on the grass. All of these members from my old CrossFit gym and other CrossFit gyms show up. They really want a workout, but it’s the time of coronavirus, people can’t really gather and the gyms are all closed. But all of these people are close to each other - definitely not 6 feet away. They’re gathered around me and I’m definitely still vulnerable because I’m laying on the ground with all of these ferret babies on my tummy. These CrossFit people want a workout and music. I have my iPhone with a playlist that I can play. But I’m telling them: “My playlists are for pole classes. It’s not your normal CrossFit playlist.” They don’t care. They’re adamant that they get a workout. So, it’s either the man I’m with or me telling them to run an obstacle course. It’s kind of like a free for all on this obstacle course. Somebody is trying to win and there aren’t any rules, so people holding other people back and stuff like that happening. But I say, “Okay, the winners get some of these ferrets.” During this whole time, the ferrets are getting bigger and bigger and bigger. Two of them get to be adult size. I put a collar and leash on them and give them away. Along with this man, there are a couple of other people around me - I can’t tell if it’s my kids or somebody else’s kids. So I give those two ferrets to these children. They go off with them. So there are four baby ferrets left and all of these CrossFitters trying to win. I’m disgusted with their narrowmindedness about needing to get the workout in at all costs, no matter what else is going on in the world or that I have these baby ferrets that I need to take care of and they’re super precious and fragile and we need to be gentle. All these CrossFitters feel single-minded and not so bright. They just need to do this run. Some are bitching about the music and playlist even though I warned them it wasn’t going to be what they thought. I’m super annoyed with them. They run off to do their run. My attention is back on these baby ferrets - the four that are left are not full size yet but they are growing, and the mom is still with me. As each of the babies gets bigger, I give them a collar with a little leash so their owner or whoever has them takes good care of them. There’s this process I’m going through where I’m a little bit sad to have nurtured these little ferrets and now they’re leaving me. I end up giving them away, but I can’t remember if I do give them to some CrossFitters or if other people show up and I finally feel good enough that they’re going to good homes. That section of the dream ends. The next part of the dream is now I’m in the observer role. There’s a man and his son - I don’t know who they are. He’s caretaking his son in a very beautiful way - he’s very attentive. They’re in a neighborhood and a block party is happening. While the man is taking good care of his son, some of the neighbors start to get really nasty and accuse him of being gay and a molester and get really homophobic. As the observer, I’m not very neutral. I’m absolutely irate at the ignorance of the people who are accusing this man of horrible things and who clearly loves his son and it’s not their fucking business what his sexual orientation is. They start to ostracize him. All of the neighbors pull their children away from him, as if he’s going to harm them somehow. One of them says, “We need to take your son.” The man stays pretty even keeled in his response; however, I’m fucking pissed. There’s a popup tent and he goes under this tent. He starts to tell a story about horses, but it’s clearly a metaphor for his life - about how he came out and he’s actually very gentle and would never harm anyone. The adults are way back in the crowd and they’re basically not listening - they’re all talking amongst themselves. But all the children come to sit around his feet and listen while he tells the story. The man finishes his story and as I listen in, some of the children start saying the most profound shit - spiritual truths coming out of the mouths of babes. The parents are fucking oblivous - still being nasty and homophobic in the background. This man gives a horse figurine to each of the children and they take the horse figurine and go back to their parents. The man’s son stays with him as the children disperse. I am wondering if the wisdom of the children will be heard because the parents seem so stupid, for lack of a better word, and that’s totally my judgment coming through, because I was not a neutral observer. I had no patience for the parents and really wanted them gone and out of the dream.",Rose,last_nights_dream
603,1363,,28/04/2020,04/28/2020 00:02,"“The New Species” This dream begins outside of the cancer hospital in the city where I live. The place where I’m sitting is a couch. It’s a rest area alongside the sidewalk that’s part of a row of open air type vendor areas that people would set up - similar to a festival or an open air market. So there are a number of these inhabited by other people doing things. No one is selling anything in this one - it’s simply a place where people sit and have a conversation. I have a glass of water on a raised area, a table. Someone I know comes in and sits down. I don’t notice at first that he has a pet with him. We’re having a conversation that is of no importance. It goes on around me. I’m not really engaged with it. I’m aware that Manitoulin is having with the person beside me, Adama. I notice after a few minutes that he has brought a pet with him. It comes out of his jacket pocket. At first I think it’s a snake. Its body is maybe a foot long and it’s like a long worm. It’s circumference is maybe 2-3 inches. It’s even all the way from head to tail. It sits like a snake, the way a cobra would curl up the lower part of its body and the upper part of its body would lift up. So, it’s doing this, sitting on the couch beside him and lifting its head up. It’s just kind of looking around in a very nonchalant way. It seems relaxed. Its skin is dappled, so the color underneath is maybe a light ochre and the spots which are even from head to tail are a dark terracotta. Now I see that the sunlight is hitting it. Strangely, when the light hits it, you can’t see the contrast between the markings and its more a dry brown glass color. I think this is interesting. Now I'm watching it interact with its environment and I’m really not interested in the conversation that’s happening around me. I’m partly struck by awe that I don’t know what this is - it’s new and I’m watching it - as well as a little bit of fear because it also looks somewhat like a snake and I’m slightly afraid of snakes. I’m okay if they don’t dart, but once they start darting, I’m not quite sure where they are and get a bit nervous. My nervousness starts to subside because I’m trying to look at my fear and thinking it can’t be dangerous because it’s this man’s pet. I wait for a lull in the conversation and address him and say, “Manitoulin, your pet, what is that?” He says, “Oh, don’t worry about it. He’s fine.” He doesn’t directly answer my question and continues on with his conversation. So now it’s roaming a little bit farther from him. At one point, I’m not sure where it is, so I get up. I see it’s gone behind the couch. And now it’s up on the counter where the drinks are. Then it’s over on the floor in between the two couches that are facing each other for the purpose of conversation. I’m starting to feel anxious that he’s oblivious to where his pet is. There’s a lot of traffic - people walking back and forth - and it could get stepped on. So I’m starting to feel concerned for this creature. I interrupt again and say, “Excuse me, did you know that your pet has wandered off?” He says, “Oh, it’s okay, he always comes back” So, I’m like “Hmm, alright,” and I sit back down on the couch. I’m still looking to see what it’s doing. Then I notice that arms and legs have popped up from the center where its thorax is, and it’s now looking a little bit wider. It’s using this to navigate more sure footedly around the area and to dart in and avoid the feet of the people. It moves across the road and dodges all the people. It looks up over the stone wall, looks around, then comes back, dodging all the people again. It comes back onto the couch. Now it’s sitting beside my glass. I approach it. I’m thirsty and I go to take a drink of my water. There’s this disgusting musky scent in the water and it’s clinging to the inside of my mouth. Now I can see it’s made my water cloudy and it’s completely ruined it. I exclaim, “Yuck, oh my god, this is disgusting.” Manitoulin turns around laughing. He says, “Oh my pet must have sweated in your water by mistake. I’m sorry.” I ask him what this means. He says, “Oh, well part of the reason that it can navigate so many environments easily is because it exudes this musk.” I ask him again what it’s called. He says, “I’m not sure. I don’t know what this is. But there’s more than one of them.” Then I notice that two more walk up out of his pocket. At this point, they don’t yet have arms and legs. But they’re babies. The one that’s been wandering around is the mother. Then my friend says to me, “Would you mind watching these? I have to leave to go to work.” Now, I’ve got a cat with me as well. I say, “I’m not sure if I can do that. I also have this cat to watch.” He says, “Well, this creature gets along with all other animals.” So I look at this for a second and I see the cat approaching it. Again, the creature retracts its arms and legs into its body, curls up the lower part of the body the way a cobra would, and passively sits with half the body upright while the cat examines it. Then I can tell by the cat’s behavior that it’s not aggressive or threatened. So, I agree that I will watch the three creatures - the mother and babies of this new species. My friend leaves. Now I’m sitting on the couch alone because the other person he was speaking with has also left. Two new people come in and sit down on the couches. I don’t know who the man is. He says he’s waiting for his son. At this point, all the pats - the cat, the female adult and the two baby creatures - are moving around. So I start to follow them, keeping my eye on them, but allowing them to interact freely with their environment. So we go through this open air marketplace. I’m not interacting with anyone, just following the three animals, watching them interact. Now the day is later the angle of light I was watching earlier has moved across the sky to the opposite side. Evening is coming. I pick up all four of the animals and tuck them up under my arms. I’m aware of this rather unpleasant musky scent from the reptiles. As I pick them up, their bodies aren’t scaly - it’s more like a horse’s skin. I walk back to the couch area and think my friend’s shift should be over soon and he should be coming back to pick up his pets. While I’m there, the phone rings. I think, “Whose phone is this?” Manitoulin’s girlfriend comes in and picks it up. She starts talking and she starts crying. She’s sobbing and saying, “He just left me tied up in the bedroom, and I’ve been there all day.” She’s crying and telling somebody this. I think, “Oh, that’s really horrible.” Then Manitoulin gets back, takes his creatures, and thanks me for pet sitting. Then he sees his girlfriend sitting there, gives her a big hug and apologizes for leaving her like that. She’s still sobbing, but they leave together. Now it’s dark and I don’t know where I’m supposed to go, plus I want to shower and I’m so thirsty because my water has been soiled by this creature. I really want to change my clothes which are stinky from this really interesting nice pet, but that I didn’t like interacting with terribly because of its odor. So I wonder where I can go and change and get a fresh glass of water. I walk through the city. Now it’s almost midnight. The scenery changes from people going about the bustle of their daily life into other people you start to see at night who I’m not terribly comfortable being around because I think that they might be using narcotics or yelling at each other and are slightly aggressive. I think alcohol is involved and I probably want to stay away from them. So I’m at the opposite end of town now. I think, “Well, I wonder if it’s okay if I go into my lover’s house and just stay in the kitchen, wash and sleep on the couch…” So I open his door, really really quietly. Now it’s 3am and I don’t want to wake anyone. I see in the dark that the couch has got someone on it and there’s a bunch of clothes and blankets on top. It’s hard to see who it is. So I stand there really quietly for a moment, letting my eyes adjust to the dark. I see arms and hands. I realize, “Oh, he’s sleeping on his own couch. That’s odd.” But I don’t want to wake him. So I stand there for a few minutes. Then he rolls off the couch, like someone falling out of bed when they’re sleeping. I see that there’s someone else with him and now I’m really uncomfortable. So I slowly turn around, open the door knob soundlessly, close the door behind me and leave. Now I’m back out on the street again and walking the opposite way through town. Nothing is open. I’m thinking to myself, “Wow, would I ever like a cappuccino because I bet that would take the taste out of my mouth!” While I'm fantasizing about this - I can smell the cappuccino, I can taste the cappuccino, I don’t realize I’ve made a wrong turn. I’ve turned off the main street and am going up another side street. A person interrupts my daydream and says to me: “You should not be going there. Sorry to interrupt you, but I think you should turn around and go back to the main street. Do you realize you’re walking towards Ferguson?” I didn’t! I think, “Oh no, you’re right! I don’t want to go to that area. It’s the really bad area.” So I turn back around and notice in passing that the person is 65-70 and androgyneous. Now they’re walking beside me. They were behind me. But because I turned around to go back to the main street, I’ve now walked up and am beside them. So they walk beside me as I go back onto the main street and for a few blocks. They say to me: “What were you looking for?” I say that I was hoping to find a cappuccino. They comment that nothing is open at this time and maybe if I walk a couple or few blocks up the main street and just wait there a half hour, one of the coffee houses will open. I say, “Yes, I do think you’re right. Thank you.” Then they exit off the street. Now the sun is coming up and I can smell the signs of the city waking up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I’m in charge of making a meal for these children that are coming in. It’s a soccer clinic and all of these younger children are a part of it. It’s a mix of boys and girls and I think they’re all between the ages of 8 and 12. I’m supposed to be preparing the food, but also making sure there’s enough for everyone. There’s probably 50 kids coming through to eat. I’m working on it. The deadline is getting closer for the time I need to have the food prepared. It’s not totally prepared. There’s an interesting piece happening here where I have a basket of feathers - they could be chicken and raven feathers. I am taking the feathers and sewing them one at a time onto this food and it makes the food more abundant. So, I’m full on doing spells here - totally witchy. I’m realizing I’m running out of time, though. This man I know comes in. He says, “I’ll help you get this fixed up.” He comes in. His energy is very jarring to me.

He’s talking the whole time - fucking windbag taking us so much air and space. He’s saying, “We need to listen to this music,’ and he puts this music on. It’s kind of jazzy and reminds me of the band Pink Martini from Portland. He is ruining the flow and I don’t like it. Now I’m really not getting things done. The thing is he’s so earnest and he thinks he’s helping. But of course, my self-reflection is, oh why do you have to be a bitch about it? But he’s not fucking helping. And he’s just taking up so much space and hijacking it. The kids start to come in now. The food is not ready. He says, “It’s okay kids! We’ve got plenty here!” I’m looking at him and am like, “We barely have enough to feed the ten that just showed up and there’s going to be forty more coming.” So the first ten come in, get their food and they’re eating what they have. I’m like, “Oh, this is fucked. I don’t have the rest of everything I need.” The magic spell was like fishes and loaves - I was making more food out of the food we had - and now I don’t have any more of the food base material to make more food with. So more children come in. They’re sitting at tables with their plates. They had to go to their spot, grab their plate, walk to the buffet line, then fill up their plate. Now all these kids have their plates, but their plates are empty and they’re looking at me. All that’s left are mashed sweet potatoes or yams. They’re looking at me and the bacon is all gone - the meat/protein is gone. There’s not other vegetables. It’s just this bit of sweet potatoes and there’s not enough for the kids that come in. They’re staring at me and I have the worst sinking feeling in my stomach because I can’t feed the kids. It’s because my super efficient and effective ways of making food stretch and last just got hijacked by this dude. I wake up feeling completely fucking irritated.",Rose,last_nights_dream
608,1364,,29/04/2020,04/29/2020 00:03,"“The Lost Girl” This was a nightmare, definitely odd. The thing that made it odd is that when I woke up, I was frozen and thought I actually had a little girl with me and the only dream I had last night was with my ex throwing my son’s camping equipment in the garbage. It was like a dream in a dream. When I thought I was awake, the dream I recalled was going camping and spreading a round blanket out on the ground, and then sleeping bag on top of that. This is what my son slept in. His dad was to pick him up that day and take him overnight from the campground. So I rolled up the ground sheet and the round blanket. There was another layer, like a spongy mat you sleep on top of. They were all circular. I rolled them all up and put them in the back of my son’s dad’s car. Instead of them actually driving away, I’m in the backseat. As I see them approach his house, he pulls over first. It’s like a dumpster in the back of a store - a really big kind for large stores. He takes the roll of my son’s sleeping stuff out of the trunk and throws it in the dumpster. I said, “What are you doing? Why would you do that?” He said, “Because it was dirty.” I say, “That’s what washing machines are for.” He just shrugged his shoulder and said it doesn’t matter. I said, “It does matter! We go camping all the time. I’m going to need that.” He just didn’t respond. So I took a piece of paper and wrote down the three items on it and put them in my son’s pocket and said, “Next time we go camping, you’re going to have to replace that.” Then, a few minutes later, I checked my son’s pocket. The note was gone and his dad had thrown it in the garbage. This was very upsetting to me. Then I arrived home. My son didn’t even stay overnight at his dad’s, we just got out of the car and came back into my house. I am in the living room of my house and just sitting there. All of a sudden, this family appears around me. In the dream, they’re mine, but they aren’t my actual family. There are parents and they take kids and are hunting and terrorizing them. I’m watching this. I’m traumatized. They’ve got two - one is a girl, but she's an adult, and the other is an adult male. Although we’re not going anywhere, this scene takes place in the living room where they’re being hunted and shot. It’s muddy. At first the woman is naked. She is pausing at the bottom of a tree. Then the family takes aim - they’ve got a crossbow - and they miss. The woman falls down in the mud. Then they aim at the young man. I wonder why he has underwear and the woman was naked. When I look back at the woman, she’s got something covering her breasts and a small pair of underwear. At this point in time, I notice there is another girl that is playing on a climber, but it’s inside the house in the living room. I think, “Where did she come from?” Then I realize that they’ve also captured her. I wonder what horrors are waiting for this girl. I go ove by the climber. She looks happy and carefree. I ask her what her name is. She doesn’t reply. In fact, she hasn’t spoken to anyone yet. One of the family members comments that they haven’t been able to get anything out of her. They’re going to wait to hunt her until she is speaking. So I think, “Okay, this gives me some time to find out who she is and send her back to her own family where she belongs.” So, after a little bit of sitting beside her, she climbs off the climber and I take her by the hand. I sit her on my knee. I see there’s a diaper bag beside the couch. I ask her if it’s hers. She nods. So I start to unpack it and there’s a little toy inside it. I pretend that I’m driving the toy around. She starts to talk and says, “Oh, this is where we went when we came down from Halton.” I say, “Oh, did one of your parents say that?” She nods her head. So I write that down on the piece of paper: “Parent says, came from Halton.” Halton is a town nearby. Then, I say, “Where did you go when your parents dropped you off?” She says, “Um, big red engine.” I say, “Oh there’s a train?” I draw a picture of a train and she nods. So I write that down. I say, “What else is there?” She says, “Zoom down yellow slide!” So I write that down. Then I’m thinking and say, “Oh, is this where you play outside when your parents drop you off?” She nods her head. I think, “Oh she goes to daycare.” Then I write daycare down on the piece of paper. I draw a picture of a building with a sign on the front - there are no letters. I say, “Is this your daycare?” She doesn’t say yes or no. I say, “Is there a name? Is it called something?” She repeats, “big red engine and yellow slide.” So I realize I don’t have a name for the daycare. I ask her if she has a friend at the daycare. She goes back to playing with the little toy. I ask her if there is a teacher there. She also just giggles and mimics actions that show play. I keep unpacking her bag and find t-shirts. I hold up a t-shirt, but it looks bigger than she is and as if it belongs to a little boy. So I say, “Is this yours?” She nods her head. I keep unpacking her bag. I see a picture of her and an older boy. I show it to her and am excited. I tap the picture of the boy and say, “Who’s this?” She says, “Myrrh.” I say, “Older brother, Myrrh.” Then I think I could maybe get the names of her parents. I say, “When your mom is talking to your dad, what does she call your dad?” She tells me and I write that down on the piece of paper. Then I just play for a little bit because I don’t want her to clam up because I’m asking too many questions. So we play for a little bit longer. Then I ask her what her dad calls her mom and she tells me. So I write that down. She only tells me their first names. I’m trying to get the last name, but she doesn’t seem to know. I’ve asked her and she doesn’t know. Now I’m feeling I’ve got what the daycare looks like, where she might actually live and her parents’ first names. I don’t know her name yet, though. She hasn’t been able to answer me and tell me her name yet. Anyway, I take her by the hand and go into the other room and I call the police. When the officer answers the phone, I identify myself. Now I’m crying. I’m telling them that my parents have kidnapped a girl, but I don’t know who she is and she doesn’t have any identification, but I’ve got a little bit of information. I ask if they can come and get her. I’m also worried that they’re going to keep her in jail overnight because now it’s dark - it’s the middle of the night and it’s taken me a few hours to get his information. I’m asking if they can leave her here with me overnight and come get her in the morning. The officer says, “Well, we’ll decide that when we get there.” So, the officer pulls up in front of my house and comes in. Now they’re telling me that she might have rabies and we all need rabies shots. So, in order to give the rabies shots - you know how in a dance, all the choral dancers can hold onto a piece of fabric tightly and then they pump it so there’s air in the middle and the principal dancer will stand on the air in the middle and the choral dancers lift up the fabric and she’s floating - they’re telling me I need to pump. Now there’s another officer, a female. This thing we are pumping is circular - the same size and look as my son’s sleeping equipment that i thought was thrown in the garbage. They’re telling me to pump it and hold the three layers together with my fingers. As we pump, the vaccine will be created in the center between these layers. The little girl is still standing beside me. The police officers said that as long as we’re vaccinated, I can keep her overnight and they’ll come get her in the morning. In the meantime, they’re going to put the data in that I’ve given them and see if they can find a family. This was my idea - I say, “Is there any way you can put this information in, because they’re obviously missing her and would have reported her missing? Here, I have their first names already!” They agree to do that, but will leave her with me and see if there’s another family that has reported her missing.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

Aiden was carrying his usual umbrella though it was a sunny day. D. L. was also there, as was a black man whose name I don't know, though his brother was W.W.B. Both D. L. and WWB's brother were potential suitors to Katie and were still hanging around.  D. L. wanted to be with Katie because Katie was very conservative and one of D. L.' personal goals or challenges was to get into a relationship with someone who was highly conservative just to show that he could do it. It was clear that his intentions were not good.  WWB's brother was just hanging around being creepy.  Out of the sky to our left, we saw a plane approaching. It was a small, silver dual-propeller plane and WWB was in it and was coming to support his brother and give his approval for his marriage.  As the plane approached, the dream became a cinematic film and transitioned to black and white. The plane hit the ground and shattered into a mass of grey metallic particles. William and I discussed how the animation was cheap.  The dream transitioned (or this is a new dream) and William and I were in a building where voting for the marriage of Aiden and Katie had taken place. It turned out that William had rigged the voting to ensure Aiden would win.  Then we were at our house and it was raining. I was in the back porch wearing my pajamas and had to get out to the garage to get something. I got there only getting minimally wet as I was able to hold something over my head. I opened the door, ducked inside, and found what I was looking for. On the way out, I shut the garage door with the panel on the wall and jumped over the laser sensor which detects movement and reopens the door.

We approached a house on our left which was two stories and dilapidated. We pulled the car into the driveway and were debating whether or not to approach the door. I think that I had to use the restroom and was going to look for one while waiting for my mom to knock on the door.  We did go up to the door together and my mom knocked. We waited for a few minutes and no none answered. We knocked again, and eventually a 5 year old Hispanic boy opened the door. For some reason, we began to suspect that his father was abusive or a drug dealer. We pretended to be DSS agents and began speaking with the boy in an attempt to surreptitiously find out if our impressions were true.  His father showed up but didn't speak English so we continued to speak with the boy in English so that his father would not understand.

We’ve entered through the garage into the kitchen, which is the way we would always go into her house. Then, we go into the foyer. It appears a lot smaller than it did when I was little. I comment on how much smaller it is. The box or table I’ve brought isn’t going to fit very well because I underestimated the size of the space. But then Elizabeth takes me under the stairs and says, “See how tall the ceiling is?! It’s always been this tall.” Then I say, “Yes, so tall!” Then I look at the stairs and remember how we would slide down the stairs. I also remember how we would play under the stairs and the memories are delightful. Then I go out the front door. I have a mission - somewhere to go, someone to find or something to discover. So I leave Elizabeth at her house and go off on my own. I can’t recall much about the journey. Then I am arranging to meet up with Margarent for an acupuncture healing. I go up the stairs and knock on her door. She opens the door. Her office is very narrow and there are no walls - it just drops off into space. She doesn’t have any tables, so she is no longer doing acupuncture. She has a big rolling chair that she sits at her desk. I look and think, oh my gosh, she has to be very aware all the time and not push too far back, or else she’ll just fall off the edge of the world into space. So I sit down. I look around and tell her, “Oh, I have been studying Egyptian spirituality and also very interested in bears. I’ve been thinking of bears and dreaming of bears.” She’s delighted and does a cackling laugh. Then she sits me down next to all of her bear paraphernalia that she has collected recently because she too has been in communication with the bears and the ancestors. She has a bronze bear and a stuffed teddy bear and other miniatures. As I sit down, the stuffed teddy bear turns to look at me. It is sitting over my left shoulder. The bear looks at me and somehow smiles, and opens his mouth a few times as if speaking! Then he closes his mouth and becomes inanimate again. I’m a little surprised. Then the bear does this a couple more times. Margaret is delighted about this communication. She tells me to come back tomorrow. So I leave and return the next day.

A huge wave comes and crashes over the boat, throwing us all into the water. The water is black from the storm and the night I see this animal that looks like a dead whale being pushed around on the waves. I struggle up to the whale to see if it is alive and if it could be saved. I know it is dangerous, but I do it anyway. As I reach to hold the whale, it turns into a prehistoric or alien creature, close in size to a sea turtle, but alien in shape and texture. Now I’m trying to keep a hold of this creature and bring us both to the shore. I see other people I know in the water and we are all diving under the waves to swim in calmer depths. When I come up for breath, I notice people in rowboats. They are not good people. They are wanting to capture this creature and take it from me. I need to work harder to hold on and swim deep under the water to safety. They see me one time when I go get a breath of air, and I feel like I’m in grave danger. Somehow I get away. I reach an underwater city. I open a door into an empty room and then go through another door to a cobbled street. I am still underwater, but can breathe and move easily. I must keep going and hold this creature close to me because they could get me at any moment. Then in another part of the dream, I am with my friend, George and a friend of his who I don’t know.

619,1153,,01/05/2020,05/01/2020 00:05,"I’m with some friends - one or two are high school friends, but some are co-workers. I’m at a grocery store and we’re stocking shelves and cleaning up. We’re in the breakroom, too. We have to clean up the store to prepare it for the next day. There’s an interesting split between how much the men and women are cleaning up. The work is getting done, but the small details keep getting missed by the men and the women clean up after them. The dream shifts a little bit out of the grocery store to another room, maybe a home because there’s a home office and what looks like a home entertainment room. I’m watching a man who is a BDSM trainer and you can book sessions with him. There’s also a gorgeous super curvy black woman and it’s her birthday. Her husband has booked a session with this pornstar BDSM trainer. His name is King Noire. She’s so freaking excited and it’s so cute to see her exclaim, “Yeah, I’m going to get hit with a paddle!” She’s really excited that this is her birthday gift and her husband is excited for her, too. Now we’re in what looks like an underground garage. She’s in some short shorts with a skirt over top and a regular top on. She’s walking down a ramp. There are other people getting ready for the scene. She’s so excited. She drops her purse and when she goes to pick up her skirt, it rides up. She’s wearing shorts, so you can’t see anything, but she’s like, “Oh my!” Her husband is standing behind her. You can tell she is nervous and excited at the same time, but doesn’t know which way to go with it. So she heads down the ramp and disappears into the darkness of this underground garage. I think this is perfect and she’s getting what she needs. I’m observing that part. Then I become part of the dream. Now it’s me and it’s my birthday. The whole tone of the dream changes. I’m with the person - but they’re not actually King, the BDSM expert. I can’t tell the person’s face, but they’re a tall, muscular and strong male. There are other men around. Whoever I am with, he and I are flirting and he’s telling me he’s going to treat me good on my birthday. We’re in the entertainment center part of the house. There’s a huge movie projector and a movie playing and there are some really comfy big seats. He’s sitting in one of them and I’m sitting on his lap. Now the dream starts to feel weird because I’m watching these other men in this room with women - they’re chasing the women. It reminds me of scenes where you see a satyr chasing nymphs. But there’s an edge of danger that it may not be consensual. I see someone in front of me cracking a whip. I turn to the person whose lap I’m sitting on and ask, “Did you bring one of those for my birthday?” He says, “Oh yeah, don’t worry about it.” I’m like, “Okay!” He’s tending me to give me what I want and he has his own desires but is holding them in check - I can feel it. There’s another scene where things start to shift. Now instead of being in this entertainment movie room, all of a sudden we’re in a different room. I feel like a sacrificial offering. Now King is there in the room. He’s sitting in front of a computer at a desk and I can’t tell if he’s editing film. I can see out a bunch of windows to skyscrapers - a city. I come up to him, put my arms around him and tell him, “I know I’m going to be okay.” He clenches his jaw and starts to pretend to headbutt people three times. He’s really tense and he’s gripping the computer mouse. His whole body is really tense. I ask, “Are you worried about me?” He says, “Yes, and I know you’ll be okay.” I say again, “Don’t worry, I’ll be okay.” Then it’s time for me to head down to this underground parking lot. King is walking me down the ramp. I go from light into the dark. He has to stop at a certain point, and now it’s just me going forward from this point on. Now the dream gets a little funny. It’s still me. There’s a group of men - all white men and their faces are covered and they’re wearing all black. They kind of look like the Ku Klux Klan, but they have black instead of white. There is leather and chains and spikes and a lot of weapons - knives, rope and chains. This is the part where I pop out. Now I’m watching myself. They’ve formed a semicircle and I’m walking down into the middle. They grab this material with straps and loops for their hands. They come around me in a circle and take this material. They open it up - it was folded like an accordian. When they open it up, it circles around me. I am enclosed in this darkness - this black fabric material that looks like a set of bat wings, but their hands are through the loops and they are closing it. That’s the last bit of the dream I see - myself being enclosed in this thing. I can feel King or my Lover behind me is tense and not okay with it. But this is something I’m supposed to be doing - being a sacrifice. There will be pain, but it is consensual. But there is an edge of darkness as it is not a consensus between two people, but there are larger forces at play. King keeps acting like it’s out of his control.",Rose,last_nights_dream
620,1365,,01/05/2020,05/01/2020 00:06,"“The Language” This dream is a little complicated to explain. The best way I can lay out the architecture is that it’s kind of like a spiral. The first layer, when I go through it, I’m not quite in it, then each layer I'm a little deeper in. There’s also a vehicle for getting there and I don’t know how to describe it. It doesn't move on the land. It’s not an airplane. It doesn’t go way high up in the sky. It hovers a little above the rooftops - perhaps the layer where birds are normally in, though I don’t see any birds in the dream. It moves really quickly. It moves through time, as well. So the dream begins. I’m exiting out of this vehicle into a town. I’m walking around the town looking for where I’m supposed to be. I don’t understand any of the language being spoken. So, I can’t ask anyone where to go. I’m just trying to feel my way around. I’m looking for a mental map of the things I need. For example, I’m looking for a place to eat, a place to study, a place to sleep. So the first time I go through here, I’m feeling ungrounded. I’m alienated because I don’t speak the language. But I’m starting to feel familiar with the urban landscape. There's a certain time I have to leave. I need to be back at that vehicle. So I’m rushing to get there. I get back in it and I leave. Then I re-enter that same town, exiting the vehicle. This time I’m looking for parks and recreational places. I’m looking for a place to swim and rest outside - not necessarily a beach, but a place I can rest after swimming. This time I have my son with me. We have found a place to rent bicycles and have rented a tandem bicycle. So I place my son on the back and I’m on the front. We both have little backpacks with what we need for the day. We are just leisurely riding around. We go to the place for swimming, not an ocean, I have a feeling it might be man made because it’s too small to be a lake. It’s quite beautiful. The water is clean and fresh, and there’s a groomed grassy area, as you would find in a park. We lay down some big towels that we’ve taken from our backpacks and we’re just lying there resting. It’s a nice day. After a little while we get hungry. I’ve already scouted a place where we can eat. So we get back on the bicycles and take our towels and everything with us. But our towels are wet and I notice that they’re wet when I put them in the packs. I’m thinking that we’ll need a place to spread them out so they don’t get moldy. So I take my son on the bicycle. We go to the place to eat. The food is good and tasty. I’m trying to decipher the language that the people speak. As I taste the food, I’m trying to taste the language. I’m trying to decipher it by noticing the flavors. When we’re both finished, instead of getting back on the bicycle, we walk through the urban area where we’ve eaten. I think, “Wow, it would be really nice to have some kind of memento from the day.” So we enter one of the shops. It’s quite dingy. There are tables set out in garage sale type style. To enter the shop, you go through the door and downstairs to the basement, which is probably why it feels so dingy and dark. But the items on the table are quite expensive and big. A lot of them are made of big chunks of led crystal. I don’t want to carry something around like this - it’s not really my thing, anyway. They’re really rather formal. But we see this little spoon. It’s like a baby spoon, made of silver - it’s good metal. I look at the top of the spoon and it’s actually carved into - a rough rendition of Pikachu. I call my son over and say, “Look! Who’s that?” He says, “Pikachu.” I say, yes. Pikachu is wearing a little hat with a small tiny delicate chain from the center of the hat down and there’s a hook on the end of it. There’s a hole drilled into the spoon and the hook sits there nicely, so it doesn’t dangle and it’s actually part of Pikachu’s hat. So I purchase the spoon and we put it in our backpack. Now I’m thinking we have to spread these towels. Now I’m wondering if we’re staying here and I’m starting to get a little bit nervous because it is getting dark. We don’t appear to be leaving in the vehicle and I haven’t arranged for us anywhere to sleep. So we’re back up on street level and I’m walking to where we entered this level. But then I see that more people are walking that way and I see the vehicle. We get in the vehicle and sleep on it. Nice passes really quickly, then we exit back out at daytime. This time I have both my son and daughter. My daughter is older than my son. I’m bringing them with me to a house that I’ve prearranged to meet someone in - someone I had forgotten that I met on the first voyage there. So we do this. We’re not on the bicycle this time, we’re just walking. We get to the house and there’s a library upstairs. So I take my kids up to the third floor and they’re in the library. Then I walk back to the first floor to meet the person I’m supposed to be studying the language with. It’s someone I feel I’ve met before - there’s some familiarity about the man. We sit at a table and he’s teaching me a word and I’m repeating it - that’s how I’m learning, back and forth rote memory style. Then I ask him, “Is there a washing machine here? I still have these things from the picnic and I need to wash and dry them. They are muddy and wet.” He says, “Yes, there’s one in the basement. Help yourself.” So I take everything down, load the washing machine, put soap in it, and come back upstairs. Then I realize I’ve put my muddy pants in there and I’m just wearing my underwear and the shirt I had on underneath. I ask him if there’s anything I can borrow. He says, yes. He hands me a pair of pajama bottoms. So I wear those and we continue the language lesson. We continue for a bit longer, then I go back downstairs to switch the laundry and put things in the dryer. I come back up the stairs. This time, there’s a second person in there for a language lesson. I also recognize him - he’s a colleague. So now the first man I was learning from is tutoring someone else and I’m practicing the language with my colleague, Keith. We both have a test coming up and we’re studying together practicing this language. The first man who is the tutor comes back into the room with Keith and me. He says the time is up. Keith leaves. I go back and get our laundry and put in our packs. I thank the man for his time. My kids have come downstairs from the library and we get our packs. I never take the test. We just get back in the vehicle and leave. There’s one more layer where I come back. I exit the same vehicle into a landscape with the same kind of architecture. This time I don’t have my kids. I walk to the place where I had picnicked with my son. I’m taking my time. It’s a nice day. The weather is temperate - not too hot, not too cold. I’m not swimming. I’m just lying on the grass in meditation, looking at the clear blue sky. I rest there for some time. It feels really good. The day is only half gone and the vehicle isn’t coming back until the end of the day. So I still have half a day to spend. I don’t want to stay by the beach anymore. So I walk back through the small town. I’m not feeling particularly hungry. I end up at the house where I had studied before. Before I go in, I see the same man that had tutored me. There’s still a nagging question in my mind about where I had seen him before. He waves over to me and indicates that I should come in even though I don’t have an appointment. We go back into the room where I had the tutoring session before. He indicates with his hand that I should sit down. So I do. Only this time he has a plate of food. He divides it into two and pushes one plate over to me and keeps the other plate for himself. I’m eating this really, really slowly, trying to figure out the flavors. I don't even know what the food pieces are. So I’m eating slowly and thinking about it. He hands me this other thing. It is the size of a potato, but not as hard as a raw potato. It feels like a thick, doughy thing. I wonder what it is. He indicates that I should dip it into the food, then take a bite. So I do. It tastes somewhat bread like, but doughier. I still don’t understand the spices. Actually I don’t like the texture of it. After the first bite, I set it back down and continue to eat the food with my fingers. Then I wish I had the spoon I bought last time and gave to my son. Then he gets up and indicates for me to look at my legs. I see that my pants are all muddy again. He asks me in the language if I want to use the washing machine. I say yes. Then I stand there for a second. He takes that same soft pajama-like thing out of the door and hands it to me. So I go back downstairs to where the laundry is and I take the rest of the things from my pack because they aren’t clean either. I put everything into the washing machine and come back up with the soft clothing on. Now he’s sitting down on the floor. There’s something on the television, which I hadn’t noticed was there. I sit down on the floor beside him. I don’t understand the language that the people on the tv are using. So I kind of drift off and am daydreaming. I am just waiting for the laundry to finish. He comes over a little closer to me and I feel that there’s some kind of sexual energy between us. Then I suddenly remember who he is. He’s someone I had tea with on a meetup - I was just meeting him, but we never went on a date. But there’s energy there. He just brushes down my arm, down the side of my leg with his hand, like he is testing to see where this is going to go. I do feel my body respond - it’s warm. But I don’t really want to engage with him that way. I still acknowledge that it felt nice, though. He backs away, but doesn't go too far. He seems content with just acknowledging that the energy is there but not taking it any further. Then we move closer to each other again and just stay there, touching, until I think my laundry is done. Then I go to the basement, get the laundry, change and give him back the pajamas he lent me and go out the door to the vehicle to fly off somewhere.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

Each person is dropped off at their house and the train continues down the tracks. I arrive at my house - a shared co-op style home. I’m putting away the groceries. There are other people in the kitchen with me. Then I’m in a more public space. I have to go the bathroom and am uncomfortable because I no longer like to use public restrooms because of the fear of other people’s lack of health or cleanliness. I go into the bathroom and see that the toilet lid and seat are covered in purple bubble wrap. I need to pull it off and put on new purple bubble wrap. I do this but am frustrated because the person before me didn’t do her job in cleaning up after herself. I lift the lid up and see that someone has defecated but not bothered to flush. Now I have a handful of purple bubble wrap, but still need to flush the toilet, then use the toilet, and somehow not contaminate myself. It’s frustrating and I don’t think I ever do use the bathroom. I’m looking for a trashcan to throw all this stuff out, then wash my hands and leave. Then I go out to the lawn. There’s a group of people singing songs. I join them. One of the songs is so wonderful that it makes me leap up and dance. I’m the only one dancing in the green grass and under the bright blue sunny sky. I’m feeling so happy alive, to be outside, to be dancing, and to be feeling free. Even though others are still not dancing, I do not hold myself back from this joy. Then later on, I’m inside a big building. There are a lot of people beginning to gather for a dance. The large group is subdivided into several smaller groups. There are rules for this dance. You have to wait to be chosen. My smaller group has two different leaders - a black man and a white woman. They are one-by-one choosing people to enter the dance. The other smaller groups are doing the same. So with each person, the dance floor gets more crowded. Finally, it’s just me and another standing and waiting in this crowd of dancers. I’m really wanting this guy to come choose me because I love the way he dances and I’m so excited for the possibility of dancing with him and feeling his rhythm. Then someone turns around and looks at me and says, “Well, you can start dancing now. You don’t have to wait for anybody.” I wonder if it’s okay for me to be dancing by myself.

The bridge goes over a many laned highway that is really busy with a lot of cars - maybe 8 lanes. I arrive at a house that’s been empty for a few years. It’s where my daughter’s grandparents used to live. They’ve both passed on. When I go inside the house, my mother-in-law, Roberta, is there. Her two daughters - my daughter’s aunts - are there as well. The two aunts are still living. My daughter has arrived. We are all meeting there. Roberta has made tea. It’s in a big pot with a round belly - like a china pot. It’s a good tea pot - white ceramic with curves and lines and roses. On the tray with the teapot are matching teacups and saucers, also made of china. They are very delicate. Each one has a different pattern motif. There’s a tray of cupcakes, too, and cookies on the table. She invites us to sit down. There’s not enough room on the couch, so my daughter and I sit on the floor. We have tea and a nice chat. We can even see dust particles as the sun shines in through the window - I can see them dancing all over everything. After we have tea and cakes and talk for a little bit, she instructs one of her daughters to get this big photo chest out. It’s about 2x1x1 and has got handles that drop down. She gets it and sets it on the floor beside the table. Then, she opens it and the aunts start taking out some pictures. The pictures are all black and white and are just in the chest, not in an album. They have the white cropped edge of photographs from the 1930s or 40s. As the aunts get them out, they are exclaiming over them, and they are bringing out a stream of memories. My daughter is absorbing her matrilineal family histories as these stories are shared. There’s one point where I’m a little bit surprised at Roberta’s description. They aren’t just photographs of the family from her side, but she also has photographs of photos of her husband - my daughter’s grandfather. She has them going back several generations. There’s a woman in quite a few of these pictures - in her maiden, mother, crone years. You can tell it’s her because her face doesn’t really change. She’s not smiling in any of them. Roberta describes her as being rather hard but brave. I’d never heard of this woman before. I’m interested that Roberta has these pictures and this whole new lineage I wasn’t aware of.

The last student was a small boy of 5 or 6 years old and I was walking him out of the building to the pickup truck of the principal who was going to give him a ride home. I was a bit suspicious of the principle for some reason, but I let the boy go and I went back inside.  Back within the school building, I found that I had been trapped inside. The doors were locked and there was no way out. But I wasn't sure yet that they knew that I knew that I had been trapped. I planned to confront the principal and kill him using some ingenious plan. Unfortunately, the school was devoid of weapons or any object that would be easy to use as a lethal instrument of blunt force.  I walked toward a supply closet and entered it, and to my surprise I found a woman within. She was black and cat-like. It's hard to describe her, but she kept transitioning back and forth between my cat Mischief and her human form. She carried a purse and within it I could hear pill bottles rattling around. My plan formed immediately: I would take the pills, crush them, pour them all into the principal's coffee, and offer it to him. He still didn't know that I knew I was trapped so he wouldn't be suspecting a thing.  Then I had sex with the cat-woman thing and the dream ended before I could kill poison the principal.

As I go into the bedroom, I see there are big potted plants - they look like plumeria trees, but aren’t. I’m surprised because just during the short amount of time of the surgery, bright yellow flowers have bloomed on bright yellow stalks. I’ve never seen this before and didn’t know this plant could grow such flowers. I point it out to another woman who is equally amazed. At first I think it was just one big tree, then I see that the “tree” is actually made up of multiple potted plants and maybe these flowers were just brought in, rather than a miracle. Then I see Mary is waking up. The man comes up to me and tells me she will need hot chocolate or matcha for an endorphin boost. He asks if I have either of those in my kitchen, and I think I do - though I’m staying in a rental house and am not sure about what is in the cupboards. He says “Okay, that’s great.” Mary is starting to come back around and is looking around, refreshed but weak. We gather her up and help her out to the kitchen.

We’re working at one of those Macy style department stores, or at least they’re working. I work there, too, but I’m there on my day off. We’re talking. I’m looking for a pair of shoes to wear. I’m barefoot and I don’t think you’re ever supposed to be barefoot in those kinds of stores, but I am. There’s an interesting dynamic going on. I know I don’t really have the money to pay for the shoes, but I’m looking anyway so I know how much they are and I can save up for them. There’s some other way that I’m helping these co-workers. I don’t know if it’s an energetic helping or if I’m doing some sort of mentoring with them. They’re both younger women. I’m helping them with an emotional thing. This part isn’t super clear. I just know I’m in the store with them and we’re hanging out. Then things get a little clearer. I’m ready to leave and heading out to a dance party or something. The younger women I’ve been hanging out with say, “Oh, we have something for you.” All of a sudden, there’s a bed in the middle of the floor. I guess we’re in the part of the department store where you can buy bedding - sheets and stuff. I come around the edge of the bed. There’s a pair of boots that these two women have. I don’t know if they bought them for me or if they were some shoes that never sold on the floor or what. But they say, “We have these shoes for you.” These boots are pretty incredible. They’re booties, maybe a little taller, with carpet bag material. The colors are very rich. The front of the shoe has a leather point and the heel is leather. It zips up the back. When I ‘m looking at these boots, the heel doesn’t look too tall - only about 1.5 to 2 inches. But when I put the boots on, suddenly it’s like I’m wearing a pair of my Pleasers and am suddenly at least 8 inches taller than I was. It’s kind of crazy that these boots transform me and I’m so, so tall. I love them and they’re super cute. I think one of the ladies says a client left them, but I’m not sure. I hear the two young ladies say, “Of course you’re that tall in those shoes. That’s how tall you are. That’s who you are.” But I’m surprised. I didn’t think I would put on 2 inch heels and become 8 inches taller. Then the scene changes. I’m in a hotel room with 2 other people in a place I’ve never been before. It looks like Florida. There’s a beach and palm trees. But it could be a different country because we have a bus driver with a very heavy accident. It’s an interesting mix because we’re in quarantine and we can’t really go out of our hotel rooms, but we are allowed to get on this bus and go touring. At one point the bus driver turns into my dad. I’m thinking that for someone who’s never driven a huge tour bus before, he’s doing a pretty good job. I don’t see much of what is happening outside of the bus. I’m not looking so much at the scenery. My attention and focus are on the inside of the bus because it’s dark and there other people on this bus trip tour - some whom I’m sharing a hotel room with and some who are just part of this tour. I’m not sure who is on the bus. There are a couple people who were my high school classmates and there are also some random people I don’t know. We’re getting to the end of the tour. My dad parks the bus, but when the bus driver departs the bus, it’s another man with an accent. As I disembark, I make sure that I tip him. I tell the others that they have to tip the bus driver because I see that they weren’t going to tip him. I say, “You have to tip him. That’s how this works.” I see them stop and give him money. Then me and some classmates head back to our hotel room because it’s time to check out. I have a feeling of loneliness and not being where I want to be. I wasn't super impressed with the tour. The beach is kind of dirty and polluted. I’m not stoked to be there. I’m sharing the hotel room with three other people and there’s stuff everywhere. It’s a mess. It’s dark and the shades are drawn. None of this feels comfortable. I’m somewhere I don’t want to be and am just going through the motions of packing up my stuff and trying to leave this hotel room. All of this feels aggravating. There’s definitely friction here. I’m just ready to be away from this hotel room, away from these people, off the bus, away from the bus driver, and just not in this dream anymore.",Rose,last_nights_dream
642,1367,,05/05/2020,05/05/2020 00:03,"“Pieces of I.D.” I’m in something that feels like the shape of an orchestra pit. It’s quite crowded with people. A few of the people are sitting in front of drafting boards. The drafting boards take up a lot of room - it’s like they’re almost side to side. There are more people than drafting boards, so the excess people make it feel really packed. I feel like I have some kind of amnesia as I sit in front of my drafting board. I don’t know what I'm supposed to be drawing. So I start to circulate amongst the people. It’s all hazy. I don’t know anyone, I don’t know why I’m there, I don’t know what I’m supposed to draw. I’m approaching some of the people. I’m climbing over other people that are just sitting there. It’s literally packed with people. I’m hearing rather than seeing that some people are involved in a conversation with their drafting board. I realize that even though you can’t really see what they’ve drawn, the conversation they are having with it is they are telling it their life story, but there are too many details to draw. So there’s another kind of media that produces an imprint on the drafting board, the person who is the architect of their life. Then I have some kind of idea of what is supposed to be on mine and I make my way back to it, but then I can’t remember what I’m supposed to put on it. I know there’s a conversation, but I don’t have enough of an idea of what mine is in order to begin the conversation that will imprint upon my drafting board. So in an effort to discover more detail, I leave the orchestra pit adn I start to walk towards a building. I realize the building is a hospital. I enter in the front door. I decide to get on the elevator and go up. I don’t press any buttons; the elevator moves on its own accord. It stops at a floor and I get off. It’s some kind of surgery and recovery floor. I wander around for a bit. There are some nurses and other staff around but I don’t engage with them. Then I get back on the elevator. This time it goes down. I get off. I didn't find anything that gave me any inspiration either to remember or tell my story. So I wander out the front door. Instead of going back to the pit, I walk through the street. I look to see if there’s anything that sparks any memory. It’s an urban street with all kinds of people. It’s really crowded. There are vendors and street artists drawing. At one point I get tired of walking and so I sit down on a bench. The bench is not parallel to the street. It’s perpendicular to the street, around the side of the building. I sit there just resting. A man was sitting there the whole time, but I didn’t see him. Now that my eyes have adjusted, I start to see him. I’m hoping he’ll just stay there and be quiet. But he doesn’t. He starts trying to engage with me and talk with me. I don’t want to talk to him. In fact he seems kind of abrasive and now he’s in my space. Instead of sitting on his own bench, he’s now come up beside me. I feel slightly threatened by his presence. I reach into my pockets, make two fists and shove them into my pockets. I feel something in my right hand and it’s three cards - they feel plastic, like credit cards. I pull them out and I look at them. It’s my identification. One is a driver's license. One is a bank card. The other one I think is a social insurance card. They have my name on them. My driver’s license even has a picture of me. I suddenly remember who I am. I’m afraid the man is going to steal them even though they aren't worth any money. I think he might take my ID. So, I put them back in my pocket. It looks like he hasn’t seen them, so I’m thinking this is good. I stand up slowly and walk away. I turn right, trying to remember where I live. I walk up the street. I see with some dismay, my ex-husband. My first instinct is to turn around and go the other way. But I’m thinking, “Wow, he probably knows where I live.” I decide to tackle this anyway. As I walk through the crowd of people, he recognizes me and looks up. I stop in front of him. But I don’t want him to know that I can’t remember where I live. So as I approach and slow my pace, I’m hoping he’ll say something to me first. He does. He asks me where I’m going. I say I’m heading home. He says, “Oh.” I wait, hoping he’ll give me some clue where that is. He doesn’t say anything. Then he says, “Just a second. I’m trying to load up these bags.” I look down and he’s got shopping bags. He has a lot of stuff that he’s trying to put inside of them. It looks to me like he doesn’t have enough bags. He keeps putting things in, then taking them out, trying to reorganize them in an effort to fit everything. Then he hands me the bags and says, “Can you do this?” I don’t answer, but I just start to organize. Then he wanders off. I'm just organizing his stuff in the bags and I’m actually making it all fit. It reminds me of packing to go places when we were married and how he would say things didn’t fit in the car, and I would go and fit it in. It reminded me that I always had to do stuff for him. I’m slightly irritated that here I am back on the street and trying to find my way home, and here I am waylaid by trying to put his stuff in his bags. Then I focus again on the task. A woman comes up and asks if any of this is for sale. I say, “No, it’s not mine.” But as I look at the bags, I see one has some of my stuff in it and am wondering what it is. It’s CD’s. So I look at them and wonder why he has all my CD’s. As I’m wondering this he arrives and says, “Oh, I see you’re finished. It all fit. This is good. Let’s go now. Why don’t you take that bag? I’ll take the rest.” It’s the one with my own CD’s in it. I decide to ask him, “Do you know where these belong?” and I indicate the bag of CD’s. He says, yes. I say, “Where?” He says, “Just up the street a couple blocks.” I think, “Oh, good. He knows where I live.” So I decide that’s good. Then I ask, “Do you know where the rest of my purse is? I’ve only got these three pieces of ID.” He says, “Yes, it’s in one of those bags.” That’s where I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

644,833,,06/05/2020,05/06/2020 00:01,"This dream is Outlander meets Simpson’s cartoon meets COVID-19. I am observing the dream, like watching a movie, but I also get to enjoy the embraces when they happen. The people in the dream are Jamie and Claire from Outlander - they look like the actors in the TV series - and Jamie’s wife in one of the books, though she doesn’t look like the character in the TV series. Before I see them, I am watching people on rafts in a big wide river. It’s dark, nighttime. The rapids at this part of the river are quite rough and throwing the rafts around. Some people are chasing other people. Someone falls into the river and is nearly drowned by the water and other people holding his head down. Later, people are recovering on the riverbank around bonfires. There are two bonfires near each other. I can see that the outline of the further fire is making outlines of mystical beings. People are being divided into expedition teams to go out into the night again. Then, the COVID/Outlander/Simpsons scene: sometimes the people are portrayed as Simpson cartoons with medical masks. They are also wearing masks in their human form. There are several reunions - it’s like my dream psyche is trying on different scenarios to find the most romantic storyline. One is a kitchen, one is a cave and one is a rock pillar tower underground. Each scene has a collection of colored rocks and Claire and Jamie meeting again for the first time in 11 years with the big embrace and kiss. They are looking at the rocks - plain rocks, but colored naturally in yellows, reds and blues like the rocks at the river near The Painted Hills - in waking life, we went to this river last weekend. While the kiss is happening, the boys walk in. Jamie and Claire have a son and he has two friends - the sons of Jamie’s wife. Their son is happy, but the other two are angry. The kids are Simpson characters. The brothers run off to tell their mom and create danger and drama for the two lovers, interfering with the bliss of their reunion.",Ana,last_nights_dream
645,1368,,06/05/2020,05/06/2020 00:02,"“The Barge” A great deal of this dream is spent on a shoreline on a pier around a large body of water. It’s quite intricate and detailed. I’m with a mixture of members of my extended family and people I don’t know. The group is consistent and moves around as if we’re on an adventure tour. There are some scenes just around the body of water, some in the buffet and some in a jeep in a jungle place. I’ve never been on an adventure tour, so I don’t know if that’s the accurate name for it. It starts at the pier. I’m just standing there. I don’t know if I’m at a really large lake or an ocean. I’m just watching. I’m looking at the water. You can’t see land when you look forward. The water just keeps going. It’s a sunny day. I can see where the light is hitting the water and making those beautiful diamonds. It’s also very balmy and a bit windy. I’m enjoying the feel of that on my skin. It’s sunny, but not sweltering. There are large barges that occasionally pass by in the vista that my eyes are feasting upon. They’re really far away in the distance. Some people gather around me. I realize I’m kind of part of a group. The group is moving from the pier to somewhere else. I’m being told that it’s time to go. Somebody is in charge - I think - and is telling people it’s time to move from this place to another place. I reluctantly move inside with the group. I never see the entire building. It feels long and low. We are shuffled into a meeting place where we’re supposed to be going to our rooms to collect the stuff we need for some kind of land excursion. I realize that I’m supposed to be withe two of my girlfriends, but they appear to have abandoned me and gone on without me. So I’m looking around to see who I still know that I might want to sit with or identify with on this part of the trip. I don’t actually see anyone I know, just people I recognize who I’ve been with before. I don’t try to join them because they’re in a family grouping. There’s one family with a husband and wife and toddler, but I don’t feel I know them well enough to be welcomed in their grouping. So I just kind of stay by myself. People are packing food. I realize I’ve missed breakfast and I go over to see what’s there. There are muffins. But I don’t know if they’re gluten-free and I know I can’t eat wheat, so I don’t get them. There’s something else on the table. I’m looking to see what it is when the toddler girl from this other family reaches up. She is trying to get one of the muffins, but she’s too short and can’t reach it. I’m looking around to see where the parents are. They are not in the room. She asks me if she can take a bite and I don’t know if it’s safe for her to eat it. She tells me, “My mom said I can have one.” So I break off a small piece of muffin and give it to her, but she wants the rest. So I break off just the top and put it on a napkin. Then she starts leaving out the door and goes back toward the pier by herself. I follow her to see if her parents are outside. But they are not. She goes to the pier, which I know is dangerous. I take her by the hand and say, “Just a minute, let’s find your parents.” She points further up the pier and says, “They’re over there.” But I don’t see anybody. She’s fairly determined and tugging me. We’re standing on the pier again when I see a really large barge. It’s doing a sharp turn. Other people are saying, “Oh look! It’s garbage day.” So the barge is coming a lot closer to the pier than it has at the beginning. This one is coming quite close. It’s really, really long and has big metal garbage disposal things, a crane, and the big kind of fork thing that picks up metal containers and dumps them into bigger thing on the barge. The crane piece is sticking out the back end. I’m starting to think it's way too close to the pier and if it completes its turn, the end of it is going to swing overtop the pier. So there’s some danger here. It starts to swing and it moves really quickly for a barge. Normally they can't turn that sharply or quickly. I pick the girl up and it’s just in time because the crane thing at the back of it does sweep overtop the barge. It hits a light post that’s on the pier. I think. “Wow, that’s really weird. It should have knocked that post right over, but it didn’t.” The post is still standing. I think that’s odd. Then the barge moves straight forward. Now a lifeguard comes running down and is blowing the whistle hanging from his neck. He says, “What are you doing here? You’re not supposed to be here.” I tell him that this girl is looking for her parents and they’re supposed to be here. He says, “I don’t see anyone.” I turn around to take her back inside, telling her there’s no one here. I see her parents running toward her. They pick her up and take her. I hear the mom telling the husband that he and the daughter should go on the excursion because they’ve all been in this trauma but she’s not going to go because she’s not ready. Now I’m in the building again where the staff is packing up whatever is left of the food. I see my stepmother come out of one of the rooms. I’m glad. I didn't realize they had a room here. I want to go on the land excursion. I’ve got my laptop with me and I don’t want to take it. I say to her, “Is it okay if I leave this in your room?” She tells me I can and she takes it. Now I’m getting into a Jeep. It’s like a bus Jeep that seats 12 or 20 people. There are no windows, just frames for where the roof and windows would be - they’re all cut out for open air. So I’m in there. Now the scenery on the other side of the building is jungle, maybe rainforest, but it’s cleared out and doesn’t look like a natural one. It looks like someone has cleared out the underbrush. The vehicle moves through there and takes us to a different place where they tell everybody to get out. This place is a campground. There’s a fire going and trailers where people are going in with whoever they’re with. I don’t have a “whoever I’m with” so I don’t know where to go. So I just sit down on the ground by the fire. It’s quite pleasant. You can’t see the sun overhead, though. There’s a canopy of leaves and trees above. It’s cool and shady. We stay there for a little while. I don’t know what the other people are doing in their areas. We haven’t been given permission from the tour guide to walk and explore, and I don’t know what time we’re being picked up. So I stay pretty close to the campground. I wander around the outskirts a bit, looking for animals, but I don’t see any. At one point the day feels like it’s gone on. I am hungry but I don’t have any food. I’m aware that the other people are starting to come out of the trailers. They aren’t actually trailers, but more like upright standing collapsible things, like yurts. I’m aware that the vehicle is coming back to pick people up. It stops and people are filing in. I get in with them. I see the two girlfriends I’m supposed to be traveling with. They are sitting together. I move over to sit with them. But they are really tightly knit in this conversation that they’re having together and they don’t welcome me. So I feel really sad about this and sit by myself. The vehicle arrives back where we are supposed to be sleeping. There are festivities going on. The staff have created a festive atmosphere with colored lights and metal containers of food warming that smell really appetizing. I decide to go back to my room first to shower before eating. I’m trying to find my room and am not quite sure where it is. I’m looking for staff to help me. I’m also worried that If I continue to pursue where my room might be, I’m going to miss supper as well. I’ve already missed breakfast and lunch. But then I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

People would go in them and get lost and never come out. They were hidden everywhere. They’d come out everywhere. You could just be walking in the city, then there's this place hidden in plain sight and it’s a portal into these subterranean chambers and also coming back out. They’re hidden, but if I lift something up, I can see them. But they don’t look like they should be lifted. You have to know to lift it to see what’s underneath. Then there’s a tunnel or some kind of portal into the labyrinth. When I see the hidden places, I can't just go lift up the top, I have to ask the teacher. There’s some person in there. People aren’t supposed to touch these things. But I’m not in a class, so I don’t understand that. At one point I see one and I lift it without asking. I almost get in trouble. I finally found the end of it where all of them go to or come from. It’s like a giant hot tub. I pulled open the top and it was steaming and swirling but also dirty looking, almost like a sewer. I could not figure out how people go in there and then almost had to swim under to then find the space to pop up in. It just looked really gross and I couldn’t figure out how people breathed in it. At one point, the teacher or leader says something about me as I’m walking away - I think it’s when I apologized for opening one of them without asking and they were like, oh it’s okay okay.

649,1155,,07/05/2020,05/07/2020 00:03,"There’s me and a young man - I’m not totally clear what he looks like or who he is - we are the same age, young. It’s clear that we’re at my parents’ house, but they don’t look like my parents. They look like people I don’t know in this realm, anyway. I’m staying with them. It feels very much like I’m obligated. They have limitless resources - money, food, water, electricity. I know they have all this electricity because it’s cold and I’ve turned up the heat and I’m not too worried about turning up the heat a lot. I’m working on something. There’s a verbal or implied agreement between me and them that I have access to all these resources while I’m doing this specific task. It’s not clear what the task is. There is an arrangement or agreement. At one point we’re sitting at a long table and having a meal - it’s me, this young man and siblings (who don’t actually look like my siblings, but in the dream they are) and the parents. It’s very civilized. You can hear the clink of silverware and china and everyone is taking small bites. There’s small talk about my project. There’s an underlying tension because I don’t want to be beholden to them. They don’t really fit me. The scene shifts. I’m wanting to leave. There are some things I need to get done and some things I need to gather in order to go on this trip that is part of the project I’m working on. I’m fiddling with the machine that’s supposed to control the temperature. I’ve got it turned way up thinking I have the air conditioning on because it’s hot. Instead, the woman who is my mother but doesn’t look like my mother comes in and scolds me. She says, “Why are you wasting all this heat and hot air? It’s really hot out. You should have the A/C on.” I thought that’s what I was doing. I just had the controls wrong. I definitely feel very shamed and scolded by this woman. The scene changes very drastically in that I’m still with that young man. There’s not a whole lot of interaction with him earlier in the dream. Now he’s with me and there’s this feeling of connection - I can almost see the energetic cords between us. It’s very sweet. It seems quite necessary as if this is my person that I can rely on. There’s ocean and a beach. We’re outside and this person that we know comes. He’s carrying with him a skinned lizard by its jaw. You can see the lizard’s spine from head to tail. It’s a huge lizard, maybe five feet long. Apparently this person skins these lizards. The young man I’m with says, “Oh that’s not who we think it is.” Sure enough, the person that is skinning this lizard is supposedly a friend of ours. He does these things for a research project. My friend walks over to this man and punches him in the stomach and literally cuts his head off and turns him inside out. I’m appalled but then I realize, “Oh my god! That is not our friend. That is not the person we thought it was.” It’s an alien that was in the body of our friend who had this lizard that was skinned. My friend, the young man, says, “I knew it wasn’t him because the way he had skinned the lizard. He left the tail on.” It dawns on me, “Oh yeah, that’s right, he doesn’t ever do it that way.” I’m a little bit sick to my stomach because 1. I didn’t recognize that it wasn’t this person we thought we knew and 2. The person seems really sick and sadistic. So, I follow my friend out into the town and there’s a hill with a trash can. It’s a smaller hill - like the hills you’d find in a kid’s playground. There’s a backpack lying next to the trash can. My friend goes and opens up the backpack and we see the clothes of our friend who skins the lizards. They are all wrinkled. You can tell they’ve been shoved in. It’s clear that something has happened to him. We don’t know where his body is. We don’t know if he’s alive or not, but we know the clothes in the backpack have been hoarded for that other creature or being - whoever took over his body - to wear. Now it’s important for us to try and find our missing friend. It’s so bizarre.",Rose,last_nights_dream

There's about 10 or 15 of these. I see that there’s a friend I used to be close to, but am no longer. I see that Omar’s brother, Mike is there. I haven't seen him in a long time. He’s the one person I do have warm feelings towards. So I go sit beside him. He sees me, stands up and gives me a hug and says, “it’s been a long time.” I say, “Yes it has.” We sit down next to each other and we’re getting caught up. Then it appears that the meal is about to start and we’re asked to take our seats. Unfortunately, there’s a seating plan and I have to look for where my name is. I see that I’m seated beside a woman I used to be close with and am no longer, and the person on the other side is someone I don’t know. So I’m not very happy about this. She’s apparently acting as though she’s happy to see me and is quite chatty. She’s acting as though nothing has happened between us. I feel my inner eyes roll at this. I don't want to interact with her or pretend like there’s nothing wrong. The dinner progresses. I realize I haven’t given the hostess the things I brought, so I excuse myself from the table and go find my bags and give them to the hostess. When I get back from doing that though, more people have left their seats. I’m kind of relieved. I didn’t eat very much, but at least I’m not stranded in this awkward and ingenuous conversation with the woman. I realize that there’s been a gift for each of the people at their seats. They didn’t even notice it. The hostess is a little bit distressed about this - the fact that no one brought anything with them and that no one has noticed that there’s gifts at the table for each of them, and furthermore that people came and brought their toddlers and kids and left them unsupervised running all over the house. Basically what’s happened is the guests have been quite oblivious as guests and taken way more latitude than was offered and the house is trashed. Everything is everywhere. The guests have all left. They haven’t even taken their plates from the table. It’s just a mess. So I just start cleaning up. I’m helping by clearing the table and doing dishes. I make a point of thanking the hostess for my gift, which is a pair of silver candleholders that are like the Kokopeli character and they look like they were fashioned in Mexico. I thank her for her thoughtfulness. There’s also a gingerbread kit where the pieces of gingerbread are wrapped up in saran wrap. You would make your own icing and put them together. It’s a little mini house. As I’m thanking her, she’s enough upset that no one else did, that my words kind of fall around her like they’re unprocessed by her. She goes down into the basement. I don’t know what she’s doing down there. I am still cleaning upstairs. I continue helping with the dishes. There are a couple other of her family members - her two kids are helping. The dishes basically get done, but it takes a little while. I go into another room where the toddlers have trashed it. Omar is there. We gaze at each other. I feel his eyes. He beckons to me. He wants me to lie down with him. I say, “No, I can’t do that. There are people and toddlers and stuff here.” We go upstairs. He’s cleaning, too, that’s what he was doing in the other room. We go upstairs and these kids have taken all the clothes out of the dresser. As I’m picking and folding clothes up, there’s a dirty diaper on the floor. We are tidying all of this up and trying to make their house right.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I was working at a shiny glass hospital and on my way to orientation. I walked into the courtyard and someone came out crying, then everyone came out to the courtyard crying. The babies were all coming out and dying: something about the blood. Covered in blood, the staff came out to show us all and people were leaving the hospital wearing big floatation like devices. It was daytime but so cloudy it was almost like artificially daytime. I was horrified but kept walking because I had to meet my team. We walked to the elevators and my best friend from age three all the way to high school Aidan was there showing me paperwork about how she was going to buy a car to commute there. We were in New Jersey? I have never lived there, “Why?” I remember thinking during the dream (was that lucid in a way- because I kept dreaming). We walked out of the elevator up to sky level parking of rows and rows of old cars like a step back in time. Another dream. It was dark. I was flying through a house trying not to wake the occupants, which was this older lady that I didn’t know but I was trying to get something back from the house. She had these figures on the wall; they looked Italian, like a set of twelve faces but several sets all over the walls all over the house. Maybe they were jokers? They looked Italian. I wasn’t supposed to be there but she also wasn’t supposed to have something of mine.",Vera,last_nights_dream1

661,1156,,09/05/2020,05/09/2020 00:03,"I’m with my kids. They’re going on a trip. They’re going on a huge boat. The boat is in the harbor and there are icebergs all around. So, clearly we are someplace very far north. My daughter is getting ready. She’s doing that teenager thing where she doesn’t really want me around to help or anything. She’s got it, like, “I’ve got it Mom, I don’t need your help.” My son is clearly very excited. I’ve helped him pack everything. I’m trying to get a lunch packed for him. I have this container and I’ve made beautiful fajitas or something delicious looking and smelling. I’ve made it for him. I’m trying to put the lid on and for whatever reason, the container has bowed somehow. Everything is running into itself. Now the lid is a little bit tight and a little bit smaller. I’m trying so hard to get this lid on the lunch so he can have food while he’s on this trip. He’s in line. There’s this long line of kids of all ages that are going to get on the boat. There are teachers all around as chaperones and other parents. There are sections, too - a section of the line with kids who paid for lunch and they have a lunch waiting for them, and a section of kids who don’t have that. My son is in the latter section because I have his lunch for him. I’m really struggling to get the lid on this thing. I have a sense of panic that I’m not going to have this ready for him by the time it’s time for him to get on the ship. So I run down to the place where they have the lunch pre-prepared for the kids. Some of the teachers are standing right there and I ask them to help me. I add some food from the prepaid lunches because I know my son eats a ton. The principal of the school says, “Hey, that’s $30 for that.” I say, “No it’s not. I'm adding just a few things. He already has his lunch and I’m not paying $30 for that. Just help me get the lid on this thing.” We finally get the lid on it and I go back and hand it to him. I’m worried because I think it’s just a mess now. His lunch is just a mess of food all glopped together and he’s not going to eat it. But he takes it and he says, “Thank you, Mama.” Then the kids all get on the ship. I watch them as the parent. Then I’m in the observer role because it’s like I’m on the ship, but the kids can’t see me. I’m just watching everybody move around. The trip is all about climate change. There is a purpose to this trip on the ship. I don’t know if it’s because they are going someplace meaningful or if while they’re on the ship, they’re learning. They all have to take classes while on it. I think that there’s some sort of thing that they’re doing to help the environment. I’m not sure what. I do see my friend Ana. She is an instructor for them of some sort - I think it’s the physical activity instructor. I think she teaches them yoga. I observe her come up and talk to an older group of girls who is doing that older girl clique thing. She talks with them and gives them some instruction. The thing that strikes me is that everyone is in really really warm clothes because glaciers and the ship is moving through huge icebergs, and she’s in a fur coat and clogs with fur on them. In the dream, I’m wondering why she is wearing these heeled shoes on a ship? That seems not safe. She gives instructions to the young ladies and she has a clipboard. It’s clear she has duties and things to attend to, so she moves on. I’m watching as all of these things are happening on this ship. It’s a pretty well oiled machine - all the kids are getting the lessons they’re supposed to be getting, they’re getting fed, or there’s an instructor - somebody there with them. The work that they’re doing is really, really important for themselves and for the planet. I don’t know where this ship is going - we’re in open sea with icebergs but no land in sight. This ship is a self-contained world where really important things are happening that will affect things outside of it, but for the moment, everything happening on the ship is really important, somehow.",Rose,last_nights_dream

At the bottom of the stairs there was a courtyard where people were congregating. We waited for a moment and as we did, we saw that someone (or someones) odd were walking down the stairs. Their gait was awkward and they may have been wearing a special kind of shoe or device to help them walk. By the time they got closer to us, we could see that they were conjoined twins. Pretty much a normal person, but with two heads and necks.   They walked across the courtyard toward us, and as they drew near, I really wanted to speak with them. I wanted to know what it was like to be conjoined twins. Who got to eat? Did they have a significant other? are the questions I remember thinking in the dream. But I was too nervous to ask them. William, on the other hand, went right up to them and began asking them questions. They sat down on a park bench and a whole crowd congregated around to hear about their experiences.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

It was just floating in the tub. There are other people in the hot tub - random people from a dance company. They are talking about their dance company. They ask me why I haven’t left the company that I’ve joined yet. They ask, “Hasn’t it been enough? Why do you still stay?” I step in to try and get my son out. He submerses himself under the water. Now it’s worse because I’m afraid he could be ingesting this poop water. There’s a moment of panic when I try to get him from under the water. He’s younger than he is now - probably 9 months or so. I scoop him up out of the water. The poop has not only been stirred up in the water, but is now stuck to my legs, arms and hands. I’m trying to keep hold of my son while washing the shit off. It’s turned into a facial mask consistency - slimy and fully stuck on me. I’m absolutely disgusted. I get out and I still have this on me. We have to get dressed. Now we’re walking down a street through a neighborhood to downtown. There are a lot of other people walking on the street, too - actually walking in the middle of the street because it has been closed to vehicle traffic. There are quite a few homeless people with shopping carts and random plastic bags of things loitering around and quite dirty. We have to stop at a stoplight. Then we keep on going. We end up at a food stand and order food to go. I’m with my husband and my son now. They give us our food in a to-go bag. The plastic bag has a knot in the top to hold it closed and trying not to touch more of it because I don’t know how clean the bag is and I don't want to contaminate the food. I don’t want to be contaminated and I don’t want to contaminate the food, myself. We keep on walking and end up at a food truck place with multiple vendors. At one stand, they are doing a cooking demonstration. They are making an amazing wrap with long filets of salmon and cucumber and a wonderful lemongrass sauce. They are demonstrating the creation of this food. My son and I are watching as my husband goes to wash his hands. I’m holding the other food and regretting that we bought it before we knew about this food. The salmon dish looks delicious. I notice my husband has been gone for a long time. I go looking for him. I can’t find him anywhere. Finally I see a round table with all our stuff on it - our wet clothes laid out on the table and over the chairs. Our bag is on the chair, too.

666,1157,,10/05/2020,05/10/2020 00:03,"In the dream I am at my childhood home. My childhood home does have a stream in the backyard and this dream shows up in a lot of my dreams. The dream is a bit fragmented. I can’t quite grasp it. My father and I are standing in the backyard and looking down this short shallow hill to the stream. On the other side of the stream bed is a hill you can climb up and once you get to the top of that hill, you can look out over the land and see Mauna Kea and Haleakala and you can see the coast. The lava rock desert is on the other side of this hill and it is the actual landscape I grew up with and it is the landscape that shows up in this dream. So, I’m in the backyard with my father. I can’t remember what we are talking about. I remember asking him very specifically what my mother is going to do with the seven houses she owns before she dies. Is she going to sell them? Is there a trust fund? Is she going to give them to each of her kids? What is happening with them? He says, “She’s going to sell them all before she dies.” I remember thinking, Why. Her whole point was that she wanted to own one house for each of her seven kids to bequeath to them. It surprises me that she’s going to sell them. As I’m speaking with my dad in the backyard, I’m looking down towards the stream. There’s a bunch of little girls. They look like me and my sister when we were growing up, and some of my friends. They’re all ranging in age between 5 and 7 and 9 and 12. They’re down at the part of the stream where we used to cross over. It was deep in some parts, but it was shallow enough in this part, so that if the stream wasn’t running really hard, we’d get our feet wet, but we could cross over and get to the other side. In the dream, there are pools. Some of the girls are playing in the water. I see myself wanting to go down there. This is the place where I see myself walking down there, but I’m also walking down there - a little bit of an observer, but also in it. We go down and it’s just play. It feels like there are fairies - very playful and very magical. It’s almost a little pocket or bubble of carefree. I don’t remember all of the conversations that happen between me and the girls - it’s not much because it’s mostly laughing and playing. My sister is there and this strikes me because my sister and I don’t have any sort of relationship and we’re barely in contact now. But we’re all in that spot playing. There are other pieces in the dream where I’m up in the house in my childhood home and my brothers are there. I don't remember what we’re saying or doing. What stands out the most is the conversation with my dad. Part of the conversation with my dad started because my grandma is also dying. So there seems to be this ending of my maternal line - at least their presence in this realm - and they are moving on to become ancestors in the dream. It’s not so much that I feel that I’m the one taking up the mantle. It’s more that I’m observing and watching. I’m not quite sure what the felt sense is.",Rose,last_nights_dream

668,1370,,11/05/2020,05/11/2020 00:01,"“The Drew’s” I am staying with a large family and they live in a house with many rooms. The backyard has a pool. The property extends back beyond a cedar hedge, which is as tall as the house, into another property behind it that has an old cottage on it. There's another old cottage behind that one. I have a room up on the second floor. It’s a bedroom. On this particular day, we are gathering in the pool. It’s a warm pool and the waters have some kind of healing property to them. The patriarch of the family is getting old and he has arthritis in his hips. He has trouble getting down the stairs, through the house, and then lowering himself into the pool. He’s also quite overweight and it makes the arthritis in the hips even worse. However, he does manage to get into the pool and he’s just soaking in it. There’s a conversation that begins to occur about whether or not everybody should stay in that house because the mobility issues. Alos, there are several people, including me, that are staying there. One person is helping clean. She’s sleeping on a bench with a cushion on it in the kitchen. She doesn’t have a room of her own. There are two other people aside from her that also don’t have actual rooms. While this discussion is occuring in the spa pool. I’m thinking that if we just rearrange the rooms a little bit with who’s sleeping where, there would be room for everyone and everyone would have a bed. It might be better not to move because moves are disruptive and the next house is going to have similar problems as this one, unless it’s possible to find a low ranch style home. So I voice my suggestion. So some people move downstairs and other people from the kitchen move up to the top floor. The patriarch doesn’t have to climb any stairs. This way when we do the shuffle, there is room for everyone, including the people sleeping in the kitchen. The family agrees this is a good idea. After the pool, we go into the house to tell the girl that’s been sleeping in the kitchen. At that point, it comes out that the matriarch is the owner of the cottage at the back of the property. She’s been wanting to use her own cottage anyway. So she takes this shuffle as an opportunity to occupy her own cottage, which she’s happy about. Some of the family members are a little bit surprised that she’s already been sleeping in it, but they agree. I’m now down on the main floor, too. I put some things together in a bag because we have to go out to do laundry. I leave the house and go to my friend’s apartment building. There’s a line for the washing machine and the dryer. I wait. I go back up to his apartment, spend some time with his daughter, then go back down to check. This time I can put my laundry in. So I empty it out of the garbage bag. On the way back up to the apartment, there’s a strange man I find in the hallway. He asks me if I want some carrots. I don’t really know where I’m going to put them. I tell him I don’t have room for them right now. He says, “Okay, well I’ll find you later.” I go into the apartment. My friend’s daughter is still alone. So I’m playing a game with her and there’s a knock on the door. I open the door and it’s my friend. He kind of falls into the apartment. I wonder why he is knocking and not using his own key. I excuse myself and go back down to switch the laundry around. While I’m doing this, there’s a little bit of a fight in the laundry room and there are a couple of women that have been there since the beginning. They only want to use the dyers that they think they can use. They aren't letting other people use them. But I climb up on the table and put my stuff in the empty one later. They kind of give me a dirty look and huff off. While my laundry is in the dryer, the man comes in and gives me two carrots from the garden. He wants me to come out and look at the garden. It’s a community garden. I do, but I tell him I can only stay for a minute because I need to get my stuff out of the dryer as soon as it’s dry because there are two women in there who are going to probably pull it out and do something with it. While I’m outside and looking at the community garden, my phone rings. It’s my friend and he’s upstairs in the apartment. He tells me that I need to get back up there right away because there’s some kind of plot to oust him from the apartment. It’s something he hasn't done, but it’s somebody else’s fault - his name is Craig. He wants me to position myself on Craig’s floor and light a match because the draft that comes underneath his door will put the match out just at the right time and then the building supervisor will know it’s Craig’s fault and not my friend’s. I tell him I have to get the laundry first. So I run back into the laundry room. The two angry women are there and involved in some kind of fight with some other women. I get my laundry out and I rescue my suitcase from underneath the door to the laundry room and I put everything in it. I rush back upstairs onto the hallway where I’m supposed to be. I see my friend is coming out of the upper floor as I’m rushing in. I say, “Oh, I was just putting myself in position there.” He says, “Ah, it’s okay. I got somebody else to do it.” I just take my stuff up and put it in his apartment and wait there.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

A woman walked by us and indicated that she was unhappy that we'd been sitting there so long. I realized that we should probably get going, and I told Jared. Jared started up the engine, but before we could pull out, a black man walked up and stood in front of the car. He hit the top of the hood with his hand. This pissed Jared off, and Jared began to pull forward and to the right. The guy had plenty of time to move, but he didn't, and Jared purposefully hit him. He fell to the ground crying out in pain, but he was clearly not injured. He had baited Jared so that he could use him after pretending to be hurt. I turned to Jared and said, ""You really shouldn't have done that."" I may have also said, ""You really are stupid."", but I can't remember the exact phrasing.  Jared freaked out and zipped out of the parking lot to the right as fast as he could. I was annoyed because I was stuck in the car with him and knew that the police would soon be after us. I knew that at this point, Jared would be on the run from the law and that we'd never see him again.  Jared dropped me off at a breakfast restaurant like a Waffle House or IHOP, and I joined a group of my friends for breakfast.

674,1158,,12/05/2020,05/12/2020 00:02,"I am in a large warehouse with racks and racks and racks of clothing, kind of like a Goodwill, but just clothing. I think some of the clothing is slightly used, some might be new. I’m with a couple other people - I’m not sure who they are, but there’s a friendship vibe. They’re searching for clothes to wear. One of them is a woman. She finds a green dress with multiple layers to it - a sheath dress part, then a lace overlay. The lace is really frilly with lots of ruffles and volume and not tailored - it’s more of an A-line. She puts it on. It looks fine on her. It looks alright. But I’m thinking, “Well, you always wear that kind of stuff. It’s not particularly form fitting. I don’t think it shows off your beauty fully. I don’t think it actually expresses who you are.” But she likes it, so she’s wearing it. Then there’s this group of other people. We’re standing at a rack where we’ve pulled the dress from and they’re watching us. It’s like the most purposefully diverse group of people - someone in a wheelchair, all ethnicities, skin colors, gender identifications and sexual orientations. I don’t know how I know this. I just know this. So it’s my turn and I’m like, “Okay, I’ll try this dress on.” The group is like, “No, don’t. That’s an ugly dress. It’s kind of like the same shit you always wear or think you want to wear. Don’t try it on.” But I’m like, “No, I want to try it on!” I’m wearing a pair of jeans. I put the sheath part over my jeans. Already I think this doesn’t look good - Why would you wear a sexy form fitting sheath dress over jeans? But I’m just trying this on. The crowd is shaking their heads no at me. But I’m going to do this. They’re pretty adamant, like “Could you just listen to us already? We already know. Just don’t do it.” So then I pull on the second part of the dress. Of course it looks terrible. It’s a little bit frumpy with the ruffles and lace and sheer mesh. It doesn’t look good on me, it’s definitely not my style. They’re like, “Okay, so that looks bad.” I’m like, “Yeah, okay, but I had to try it on.” So I take it off and I put my regular clothes back on. Then I’m like, “Okay, there's a gigantic warehouse with racks and racks and racks of clothing I’m sure I can find something I like.” They’re like, “Yeah, please. I’m glad you tried stuff on, but now go explore more.” That part of the dream ends. Then I transition. Now I’m both the person in the dream and I’m also observing. I’m a younger woman who doesn’t really look like me, even the body shape is slightly different. I’m out in the desert - it reminds me of the Arabian Nights and a scene from the Disney Movie, Aladdin, because there’s a castle that looks like the Aladdin Castle with the big round spires, and then there’s desert everywhere. I’m with a young man. He has a turban on his head and a loincloth. I think he’s a young man, but he’s actually kind of ageless. He’s very clearly a medicine man. He knows what he’s doing. He’s working magic. I’m with him. We’re on a quest to find liquid that comes out of this one tree when it’s blooming at a very specific time. It blooms for a couple of hours and the liquid is produced then and that’s the only time we can get it. I’m going with him. I’m not entirely sure why. I think there’s a beloved connection between the two of us and also I’m learning from him and also I’m his apprentice and helper. So there are multiple layers to this relationship. We head out into the sand - the desert. I know I’m working on something. I have my own little concoction that I’m making. We come to an oasis where there is this tree/bush. It looks like a tree, but like grape hyacinths - that purple flower that comes up in the spring and looks like grapes stacked on top of each other. The petals or grape looking things are pink. We’re at this oasis. The man is doing something at the edge of the water. I’m a little bit further back. I’m sitting in the reeds. I look over at this tree and I see it bloom. The liquid comes out and it looks like dewdrops on every single one of these grape-looking petals. There are no leaves, just this trunk and this conical shape. Then all of a sudden there is dew on every single petal. I know this is the substance we need for the elixir - the nectar. There it is! I call out to the medicine man: “You’re missing it! Look! There’s the bloom. It’s happened.” He hears me and goes to gather a bunch of the nectar. I gather some of it, too. It is some of the sweetest stuff. I know I’m using it for my own potion and he’s using it for his, but I don’t know what I’m making. I just know it’s really important for me to make this and it’s important for him to make his concoction and it’s important for me to learn and watch the way he gathers and creates his concoction and for me to do my own. This is the part where the dream shifts a little bit. I become the observer. We leave the oasis and head into a jungle. He has a task for me/her. I’m watching outside of my body and notice I don’t look like myself - a younger woman with a different body type. She is muscular and thin, which is how I look, but slightly different. I see him tell her she has to climb a couple of trees to gather more ingredients. For whatever reason she’s doing it totally naked. I see her climb the tree and then she clutches her left or right butt cheek. I can tell she’s in pain, there’s a muscle spasm in that glute. It’s like foreshadowing or foreboding. She clutches it, then pats it and is like okay I’m okay, then continues on. All the tasks are very physical. One is climbing this tree. I think it’s a coconut tree. She comes down and then has to climb this other thing. She’s already checked in with herself - she had that twinge in the glute but she’s okay. But then I see her climb this one tree and she drops from a height into an athletic stance - like you would if you were an athletic person and practiced at this stuff. But as soon as she drops, I know, “Oh no, that thing that was bothering her is going to flare up.” Sure enough she lands and I see her wince in pain. I can almost see the pain shoot up her back from that glute that was bothering her. There’s a younger boy around at this point. When she dropped from the tree, she dropped onto a wooden platform. This younger boy was working the platform. He’s pulling ropes that are part of a pulley system that is part of this platform she drops on. He watches her land. He is observing all this pain shooting up her back. She is crumpling to the ground with it and I know something went wrong. You can see that this young boy is realizing that he has to go find the master - the medicine man - to come help. I can see that he is thinking that he needs to help her. As the observer, I get the sense that there was a foreshadowing and now here we are at the major cruxe of things. Of course that’s where the dream ends.",Rose,last_nights_dream
675,1371,,12/05/2020,05/12/2020 00:03,"“No Privacy” It’s an open concept house that was owned by my ex and I never really liked staying in it at all because of the open concept. We had teenage kids that were undisciplined and ran all over the place with friends who drank underage. I really didn’t like it. The dream setting is this house that belonged to my ex. I’m trying to create a space in it that has some privacy for me. Up on the second floor it was like a room but only had three walls. The fourth wall was part of the stairwell, so it was like a big niche. I hung a curtain up to create a fourth wall and I had a doorway so I could go into my room. I put a bed in it. I had my toiletries - toothbrush, hairbrush, hair dryer and something else for hair - I don’t know what it was because I actually don’t own anything for hair but they were symbolic of something in my dream. I had clothes hanging and it felt like a lot of stuff for one small space. One day when I was sitting in my room brushing my hair, two teenage boys came up. They were fiddling with the hair things - picking them up and setting them down. They were curious and seemed innocent. I explained to them that they were to clip hair back into a ponytail. They said, oh, then put them down and picked up something else and asked what it was for. I would patiently explain it to them. They just kept innocently picking things up and putting them down. Then they got to the hair dryer and other thing that both had electrical cords and switches. They kept turning the switches off/on, off/on. Then I noticed that they’d taken some things from behind me when I was speaking with one of them. I could see it out the little window now. They were using them in a different room. I picked up the electronic items and went to use them and they were both broken. I began to cry. I realized that they’d torn a bunch of other stuff out of my room without asking me and were just being destructive with it. I approached them and said: “You’ve broken my things and you should replace this.” They looked at me stunned as though I had said something completely incomprehensible and they didn’t even know what it meant. But they were sympathetic. One of them started to reach in his pockets and he pulled out a toonie and some other small coins and said, “That’s all I have.” The other one pulled out a $20 bill and gave me that and said, “Here.” I knew it wouldn’t even pay for one of them but I was grateful that they’d attempted to make some kind of amends. Now I notice that they’re in my daughter's room. She has no furniture now. One of them has brought his own giant apparatus. I don’t know what it is. It’s made of metal bars. It’s a cube. It’s almost the size of the room, which is why I guess they took her furniture out - at least that’s what I surmise in the dream. I’m wondering what this thing is. Hanging from the center of it is some kind of rope. It has a red spikey tiny ball that’s smaller than a tennis ball on the end of it. I wonder what that’s for. I ask my daughter if she’s okay. She nods, yes. I say, “But where are you going to sleep?” Then she says, “Oh, it’s okay, I can just sleep on the floor.” But she indicates to her right that there’s a duvet. It’s folded in half lengthwise and pressed up against the wall. She says she’ll sleep there. Now there’s five or six of these teenage boys in there. They’re all standing around looking at this large piece of equipment as though they expect it to do something. They’re just waiting to see what that is.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I had a child with an indigenous woman and she died during childbirth. I had a boy and I went crazy. My experience with this indigenous woman opened my eyes to the injustice of what was happening around me. I self medicated with alcohol. We lived in a small apartment above a bakery building. I was the town crazy person. When my child was about seven I totally lost it and was taken away. I think the jail or something like that or a nut house. I knew I was about to be taken and I can still see the look on my son's face when I told him I would never see him again and I was so sorry to leave him alone in a town where he really didn’t belong.

680,1159,,13/05/2020,05/13/2020 00:04,"There are a couple parts to this dream. The dreams go into deeper dreams where I’m a little bit less lucid and then I move towards more lucid, or I’m more awake. The deeper part of this dream is me on an airplane. It’s showing up in flashes. There’s one part where I’m in an airport. I’m looking at the arrival and departure boards to find my flight and the gate. There are people bustling all around me. There are gross fluorescent lights everywhere. Shops, too. It’s busy - no social distance is happening, so I don’t know if it is this time or another because everyone is close. No masks. It’s normal. Then I go from looking at this board to being in the airplane and in my seat. I’m on the end of the middle row where there are three seats in a row. There’s an aisle and then two more seats and a window. There are people all around me that I’m sorting of chatting with. I’m with a group of others, I think. I have this sense of keeping track of the other people. I’m sitting in my chair. You know how on long flights your shit ends up everywhere - that’s happened. I can’t find my sweater. We’ve landed and it’s time to disembark but I can’t find my sweater. I’ve taken up two seats in this airplane and it seems to be fine because there was no one near me. There is a stewardess or another passenger who has taken offense that I took my sweater off and maybe my shirt off, too, and was just making myself at home. But now we’ve landed and I’m trying to get my stuff so I can get off and go. It takes me a minute because I can’t find all my things. I disembark. I have a sense that the place is very, very different from Earth. It doesn’t feel like an Earth place and the flight attendant that was talking to me didn’t look quite human. So, there’s this sense that I’m in another realm. I have a sense of agitation, too, because that group I was with is off doing their thing. It took me time to find all my stuff and I feel a little left behind and I don’t want to be because I don’t know where I am. I get on a tram. It’s more like a train that will take us to our destination. I feel out of place. I don’t know where I am - this place is new, this tram is new, I don’t know where I’m going. Even though I’m part of this group, I don’t know all the people around me, It’s just a little uncomfortable and I feel disoriented. Then I come out of that part of the dream into another part where my ex’s presence is around. He’s not in the dream with me, but he’s been around. We’ve definitely been divorced. I’m agitated because he’s pulled more super controlling shit. I’m just wanting so badly to get away from this person, to get out from under his thumb, to not have to interact with him in any way. In the dream he does have the kids. It’s just me in the dream, but there’s a sense of him being around with the kids. I feel like I’m under surveillance as if he has cameras on me. I don’t even know where I am. I think it’s a house, but I’m not sure. I leave the house and go out into town. There’s a building that is a retail shop. Things are sold out of it, but I’m not entirely sure what. I need to go there because there’s a desk that I’m trying to fix. What’s interesting is my dad shows up. The front of the retail shop is all these floor to ceiling windows. A lot of them have been broken - someone was throwing bottles or rocks. There’s glass everywhere in the entry area. I need to go in. I know this shop is owned by my ex and his father. There’s something about a desk that I need to get or repair. Or I need to get something from that shop. My dad is there and trying to sweep up all the broken glass. My dad is actually part owner of the shop, or maybe he owns the land that the shop is on. I’m watching him and he’s super ineffective with his broom, so I just grab a broom and start sweeping. Between the two of us we get the glass picked up. The glass is in tiny, tiny pieces - not quite sand, but pebble size. It didn't break in big chunks - it broke like safety glass into little round pieces without sharp edges. The entryway is paved in cobblestone, so the glass is getting stuck in the grooves. We sweep up all the glass and I don’t know what we do with it. I go inside the retail shop and walk in through one of the broken windows rather than the door. There’s the desk that I need. I go to pick it up and move it and it just falls apart. I look underneath and the structure of it is crumbling. It’s like that really thin pressed board that cheap furniture is made out of and if it gets wet, it swells and disintegrates. It’s made of that stuff. I’m underneath the desk and trying to fix it. I ask my dad for help. He hands me a roll of duct tape. I try to duct tape it back together. I’m working on it and wondering why I’m trying to fix this desk. It’s my ex’s, I don’t want it, why am I fixing his shit? This desk is not going to provide what I need and is not the thing that I actually need. I come up from under the desk and there are other sturdy pieces of furniture made of real wood. I can see them and I’m comparing them to this desk. I have this sense of, “Oh god, please make sure that my ex or his dad do not show up at this shop while I’m here.” I have their permission, but don’t want to interact with them and their super controlling, contemptuous attitudes of disgust. I know I don’t want to be there when they arrive, so I’m trying to hurry.",Rose,last_nights_dream

683,1372,,14/05/2020,05/14/2020 00:01,"I’m in a store of some sort. It’s crowded and dingy and junky. I’ve paid for something that I don’t want and it’s not mine, but I’ve done it as a favor for someone else. I’m not begrudging of it either. I am just not particularly fancied with this store. Then I get picked up by two people. I don’t remember who they are. One of them is the person that I’ve picked up this thing from the store for. There’s an exchange of money that goes on. I’m trying to divide it up evenly - the change. The first time I count it all out and give half to the other person and keep half for myself. I count it and I’m missing money, so I ask if I can have all the money back. I put it all together and look at it again. There’s a couple of fives, a ten, and a twenty. I see that the twenty actually should belong to me. I should be keeping that because I paid for the item. The rest of it is divided up evenly between us. This time it works out and I explain why I need to keep the twenty - why it isn’t part of the change. Now we’ve arrived at where we’re supposed to be going. We get out of the car and go in. It's a house down by the lake. But it’s down by the port, so it’s one of those turn of the century places that sprung up near there. There’s stucco on the outside. It could have been an inn on the bottom floor - a place we could go in and get ale and food and then sleep upstairs - that kind of inn. They’re narrow and tall and stuccoed. The house belongs to somebody. I realize that it’s the skipper from the sail club. We’re supposed to eat supper there, stay overnight and then sail the next day. We havent really eaten food in the dream. But the meal seems to be finished. We go down to the water to look at the boat. It’s half submerged. The material it’s made out of is all ruined. I’m looking at it thinking there’s no way that thing is going to sail. It’s not seaworthy. The man - the owner of the boat - is describing why it will be seaworthy. I say, “Well, why don’t we start by lifting it up out of the water, dumping the water that’s in it and see if it fills with water again.” He agrees. We pick it up, turn it over and put it back in the water. He says: “There, that should do it.” I turn around and it’s almost submerged again - it’s filled with water to the extent that there’s only a little bit of the gunnels sticking up out of the water. I have my serious doubts. Plus, the stern is all buckled in. The mast is bent in the middle. He’s gone back into his house. I look at it a little bit longer. I’m standing on the pier looking at the other ships moored up there, then just gazing out at the water wishing I could sail, but thinking it’s not likely going to happen. Then I go back into the house. The man that owns the boat is looking for some of the sheets for the boat. He says, “They were right here a while ago.” I look and see a single bed in front of me. I pull the sheets back and realize there are two sets made out of tin foil - the kind of material an emergency blanket would be made out of. I tell him, “Look, you must have put both sets on one bed to save storage.” He says, “Oh, yes, that was a good idea.” I peel off the top two, fold them up and give them to him.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

Later in this same clearing, some trees have been cleared and people are building houses. There’s a vacant lot and a discussion about how we might have a place here in these woods. Then I’m in a home. In the dream it is my family home. Almost all the stuff has been moved out. So there’s just a few more things remaining - mostly books. I think I’ll just be able to pack it up into one or two boxes and bring it with me. Now as I look more carefully, there are more and more books. I look around and am overwhelmed by the amount of books - over doors, in high and low shelves. The books are heavy - mostly medical and anatomy text books. Now I think there is no way I can just pack this up in a car and go tomorrow. I’ll need more help. Now there are other people with me. They make a video call to my friend.

They all hatched at once and they’re the size of a freckle. They are everywhere and jumping on me and him. We’re both like, eww get them off. I’m trying to brush them off with a little broom, then trying to suck them up with a vacuum. I'm kind of giving it up as a bad job and thinking I just need to get out of the house. We hear this little squeaking. There’s a rat in a bunch of white paper towels in the shape of a body cast. It’s essentially the same shape as the rat. You can hear the rat inside. Its legs are not in the cast. It’s running towards me and my brother. My brother scoops it up. I get mad and say, “No, no. Give me that rat. That’s our friend. That’s who’s going to help us get out of this mess of tiny little black bugs. We need that rat. That rat loves us and we love it.” As I’m saying this, the cast on the rat is getting looser and looser. There’s more space between the rat and the cast. While I’m looking at this rat, part of me is like, “eww, it’s a rat,” and another part of me is like, “well, if I squint, maybe it will look more like a cat. That will be more acceptable.” It’s clear that this rat very much loves us. I can feel myself trying to love it back, but it’s a rat and it’s so hard. Then the scene changes. Now I’m in a home. The part of the home I’m in is like a tower. It has windows on three or four sides. It’s a square room with a round table in the center. It’s not really big - maybe 10 or 12 feet across in all directions. One side of the room does open up into the rest of the house and is bigger. There is sunshine streaming in through the windows, blue sky and white puffy clouds. It’s gorgeous. I’m having a conversation with my ex father in law who says he’s either moving to Hawaii or is already living in Hawaii. In this conversation, I feel like he’s not giving me a lot of choice in the matter. It feels frustrating, and I’m not entirely sure what we’re talking about. Then my ex shows up, or at least his voice does - I don’t actually see him. He tells me that he’s moving to Hawaii with the kids. In the conversation with my ex father in law it was apparent that I was going to need to stay in the house that I’m in and I can’t move anywhere because it’s my only place of residence. So when my ex tells me he’s moving to Hawaii with my kids, I’m pissed because I can’t get out of this house that I’m in. I’m super mad that they’re all in Hawaii. They’re not even from there.

They are ice skaters and they’re all practicing to put on a show. I’m watching the instructors teach them. There is something missing in the instruction. The dances are sloppy - their lines aren't straight, they’re not finishing their movements, and it just doesn’t look good. The teachers are hard and harsh with their instruction. You can see on the faces of the kids that they don’t like it. So I’m hired as a strength and conditioning coach. I end up taking a different role where I invite the kids to a stage - sort of like an opera house. It’s all wood and they’re ice skating on the wood. I don’t know how this is possible. However, I invite them, “Hey, come work out with me. We’re going to make you guys stronger. Why don’t you guys show me your dances so I can see.” As I’m watching, I realize they aren’t in it. They don’t have 100% commitment to the dance they’re putting on, to the movements they’re making. They are just sort of half-assing everything. So I’m giving them a pep talk: “You guys have to commit to making this dance happen. You have to commit to be in the spot you’re in so the line is straight.

You can feel the energy shift. Now they’re motivated to do it. They go back out to dance and they’re doing much better. I have this feeling that the other instructors are pissed off at me for doing that, like I had stepped out of my role and my position and overstepped their boundaries. Part of me is like, “You should have told them that.” The other part of me is like, “Oh gosh, now I might not have a job.” So I’m in a very interesting place, kind of like fuck you and fuck it. It’s more important to me to see these kids light up and shine because they’re very, very talented skaters. I want them to show people what they know how to do. Then it shifts. I’m with a friend of mine. She and I are hungry. We’re going to go eat at a restaurant. We’re walking down a boardwalk by the sea. The sea is to our right. We’re walking towards a shack at the end of this boardwalk that is a restaurant. There are tall pilings. It’s above sea water but right there at the edge of the ocean. There are seagulls and I can feel the salt spray because it is a bit windy. We are bundled up. We walk out to this sea shack of a restaurant. We sit down and start to order. I have this fizzy drink that looks like an energy drink can. I have it in my hand. She is teasing me about something I said earlier and she’s using a funny voice. It’s cracking me up but I’m also feeling kind of embarrassed. But it’s okay, it’s funny. So we’re at our table and order. I spill the energy drink. She and I are sitting down. I have four books in my lap. The two of us are looking at these books. One is an embroidery book. It’s important because there’s a group of women at a table across from us. My friend and I are going through these books, downloading information from these four books. The books are still in my lap and the women look at the two books on top of the pile side by side. They say, “Oh, those are good books.” When I remove the top two and they look at the two underneath, one of which is the embroidery book, the women get super judgmental and say, “Well, those books are crap!” My friend and I are thinking but don’t actually say out loud: “Oh, okay, well no one asked you. We weren’t even talking to you, but thank you for interjecting yourself into our conversation.” We say something pleasant, “Uh huh, thanks for your feedback.” Then at this point, I’ve already spilled the energy drink once and it gets cleaned up. But then I spill it again. I make a much bigger mess this time. It’s an energy drink and is all sticky and it smells like strawberry. I’m not actually drinking it, just apparently holding it and spilling it on the floor. Now I’m embarrassed. I get up to find a mop. I ask the cook and one of the servers. The cook is my brother and the manager is my other brother. They point me to the cleaning closet. I get the mop and go to mop it up, but it’s already been moped up. I look up and am like, “Who cleaned this up?” It was the server that I’d passed. He said, “I already cleaned it up once already, so I just cleaned it up a second time.” Now I’m feeling bad because I’ve made a mess twice and someone else has cleaned it up twice and it is a sticky mess. I think I’m hungry and we haven’t gotten our food. But I’m ready to just go.",Rose,last_nights_dream

697,1162,,17/05/2020,05/17/2020 00:01,"This dream has a deeper part where I know I was deeper in the dream realms or sleep. There’s a castle - this huge black maybe glass castle perched on the edge of a shoreline. It’s super dramatic with tall cliffs and ocean waves hitting the edge of the cliffs. Everything is dark - the ocean and the sky. I don’t know if it’s dark because it’s stormy and cloudy or because it’s night time. The inhabitants of the castle, myself included, are all pegasuses - horses with wings. They kind of remind me of the cartoon from my childhood, “My Little Pony,’ but it’s not light and joyful like that cartoon. It’s definitely darker, not sinister, just dark. There’s a couple of us flying pegasus horses. We are friends and we all have our own magical powers. We have things to do and are coming and going. It’s clear that I have a journey to take. I need to go somewhere and fly through the sky. The first part of this journey is me looking for another pegasus sister. She has gone down into the ocean to find something. I realize I need to do the same thing. There’s a greenish blue orb of light that is way, way deep below the waves and that’s where I need to go. I’m flying over the ocean waves looking for this sister and for my way in. Finally I dive into the water. It’s not cold and I can breathe under the water. It seems pretty normal. I’m swimming/flying through the water going really deep to find this blueish green light. I do eventually get to it. It takes a long, long time. I know there is something waiting for me and I don’t remember what it is when I wake up. Whatever the information is, I receive it and I come back up out of the ocean. I’m not supposed to go back to the castle. I know I am to continue this journey. So now I’m flying over the ocean. The dark has gone. It’s like when a storm starts to clear and patches of light come through. I’m heading to blue sky, sunshine and bright daylight. Clouds are breaking up. I’m flying out of the darkness and towards the sunny, lighter part. The water beneath me is changing from black, dark, inky and choppy waves and storm tossed waters to deep-dark blue of a darker ocean to greenish blueish turquoise and I think the water is getting shallower. Then I get to a point where there is more land. I’ve left the land with that castle, which was all dark and craggy with cliffs. The land back there was like black lava rock. As I approach this land and the water gets shallower, I can see shoals and places with coral reef that I can see, then little atolls - places with a little bit of land above the water. Then there is even more land above the water with palm trees. It’s more substantial and I can see that off in the distance there are homes - a neighborhood, actually. What strikes me is as I’m flying over this place, I see a wooden bridge. I land on the bridge and as soon as I land, I turn from pegasus to human. Then I notice the water around me is light green and really shallow. You can see algae growing on rocks and the water is really warm. It’s the brackish water of a hot spring. I can tell because of the smell that the water is from a hot spring coming up into the ocean. So there is a completely different kind of plant and animal life happening here. I get in the water. All of it is so heartbreakingly beautiful - the colors, the shape of the land and reef underneath, the rocks in the water that I’m walking in, the color of the water, the color of the plants, the flowers, the birds. There are hummingbirds flying in and out, getting the nectar from the flowers. There is so much life. Part of me is still that pegasus, but part of me is human now, because I turn into human as I walk over this bridge. There is a car parked on this wooden bridge. My first thought is, “How did that car even get on there? The bridge does not seem wide enough for a car, only a human. And how is this wooden bridge holding up a car?” Then I see a woman sitting in the car. She’s taking in the view the way I am. I can tell she has parked her car there because it is healing for her to be in this gorgeous brackish hot spring ocean verdant full of life area. There’s just enough room for me to walk past the backend of her car and finish crossing this bridge. Her car is in the middle of the bridge. As I walk past the car and onto this second section of the bridge that takes me to land where these houses and this neighborhood are, I feel a shift happen. I leave that very mystical and magical place I had been in with the castle and the journey over the ocean and being a flying horse, and now I’m in human world. But I’m very aware that I’m actually a pegasus. It reminds me of the movie, “The Last Unicorn,” where they turn the unicorn into a human girl and she has to wander the forest until she finds the rest of her unicorn sisters who were turned into white water ocean foam. I feel that way. I’m not human but I’m in human land. There’s another bridge. The bridges change. The first one was a wooden platform bridge and this next bridge is a swinging wooden bridge that dips down and swings when you walk on it. The reason for these bridges is that they are going over the water. There are little islands of land and I haven’t made it to solid land yet. Even then, there are ravines through the solid land. The land is not yet solid or flat. I can see past that it is flat at a certain point. I have to go over these bridges to get to that solid point. The problem is I come to a third bridge and I can see at the other end a sign that says No Trespassing. It’s not facing me - it’s facing the other way. My side of the bridge is open and in fact, everything has been open. But as I get to the end of the other bridge, it’s sort of like a dead end. There’s a house. Interestingly enough, there is a bridge parallel to this one that has chains on it that go across. The chains are very clearly there to keep people from crossing or passing. There are signs on that bridge saying you’re trespassing if you're on here. The bridge I’m on only has the trespassing sign at the end of it. I go to cross it and it stops at this house. Their backyard is really low, below me. Their house is up a bit on a hill. I can see into their garage area. There are people - two women and a couple of children - and they see me coming. They’re not poor, but it’s like the simple houses in Hawaii. They look at me like I’m not supposed to be there. I’m like, “I know, but I’ve come from the other direction. There were no signs where I came from indicating that I couldn’t come this way.” They’re like, “Come down off that bridge and come into our yard.” Somehow I figure out how to come off the bridge. The thing is I need to continue on because I know there is a house I need to get to that is much further down this path. At the end of this bridge is a road I was supposed to walk on and follow down. This road is on a place called Puako on the Big Island. This neighborhood looks exactly like Puako. In waking life, I lived there for a year with an ex-boyfriend and it was a beautiful place to live. There are palm trees, kiawe trees and sand. The ocean is to my left and land is to my right. I’m trying to get on this road and my ex-boyfriend is down at the end of the road at a house. There’s a house with a lot of people and a party going on. I’m trying to get there, but a part of me doesn’t actually want to go there. I’m wondering: “Why do you want to go there? There’s nothing in that for you.” Because there is this stopping point - this gate - for me at the end of this bridge, I can’t go any further. The women in this house want me to get off the bridge and come down and be with them. I do. Everything changes in that moment to very mundane world. They tell me there’s a concert happening. I’m curious about the concert. It’s a typical party with smoking and drinking, like the college kind of party. But it’s the neighborhood with all ages. Somebody is going to come play music. There are three younger men who come near me. They try to engage with me and talk with me. I notice at this point that it’s cold. I have knit handwarmers and a knit hat on. The pair of handwarmers is a pair I actually own - they’re elastic and grey and I knit them for myself. There’s another pair of handwarmers in my pocket that I have as extra in case anyone needs. One of these young men is talking with me about how he’s cold. I say, “Well, why don’t you just put on a pair of handwarmers? I have an extra pair.” I look down and see that he has a knit pair on, too. In my mind, I think, “Oh, he has a pair of handwarmers that I’ve wanted to knit. I just haven’t gotten to it yet.” He takes one off. So now he’s wearing one and he has another in his hand and he says, “But I’ve lost one.” I’m like, “It’s in your hand!” This whole time he and his other hand are giving me this weird vibe. I really don’t want to be around them and I don’t want to be at this party. I’m looking for a wide open space where I can transform back into the pegasus and fly away. So I find this place in the yard, but it’s covered in lentils. It’s a mountain of lentils. I’m like, “Oh my god, I can’t transform in this. I can’t even walk in this. It’s just a mess.” The ground is not solid. I can’t anchor in so I can transform. In the meantime, these three younger men have followed me. I’m trying so hard to get away from them. I don’t want anything to do with them, the party, the vibe of the neighborhood. I’ve gone too far into this reality. I can tell. I want back into the other one. Even if I could just get back across the bridge, back into that incredibly beautiful land and the bridge that was beautiful in its own way and there weren’t all these humans yet and it wasn’t packed in. I just want to get back there or fly back all the way back to the castle. But I can’t. I am so stuck and I cannot transform. I start to feel panic and anxiety because if that is my grounded space, I don’t want to be grounded there. I want the other more beautiful space. I wake up with panic, anxiety and grief because I can’t get back to that beautiful place and I can’t transform back into my pegasus self and I feel so stuck.",Rose,last_nights_dream
698,1373,,17/05/2020,05/17/2020 00:02,"“The Seven Centres” This dream starts at a wedding reception. I’m there with my daughter and my daughter's boyfriend. The reception probably holds about 50-60 people. The hall is big enough that it doesn’t feel crowded. There’s a certain amount of space between people. In fact, we are sitting at our own table. The table is bigger. There are lots of empty chairs. No one else is supposed to be sitting there. There are only three place settings - mine, my daughter’s and her guest. I’ve taken some time to do my hair before I go out. I’m wearing a silver tiara. It’s not fancy, it just wraps like a headband made of malleable silver wire. I’m using it to keep the hair from falling in front of my eyes if I tilt my head forward. I also have a multi-strand silver bracelet on my left wrist with tiny stones in it - they are opalesce in appearance. I’m wearing a light blue dress and it feels really good on my body. We’re having a conversation at the table. I excuse myself for a moment to use the restroom. On my way to the hall, this man comes up behind me. He’s fairly boisterous. I don't turn around to look at him. He’s trying to exert himself into my consciousness. I don’t want to talk to him. After I come out of the restroom, I see him again. He’s sitting at a table with some other people. Again, he’s boisterous and loud, so he’s distracting. When i return to the table with my daughter and her boyfriend, he comes to sit with us. He’s trying to sell all of us on this idea that he makes some kind of chart that explores people’s personalities and lends them insights into themselves. I listen to him for a few minutes then decline his services. However, he leaves his business card. I’m surprised that it’s located in Lindsay, a town I’m familiar with and know that I’m going to be visiting some time in the future. We finish our meal, the plates are taken away, and we are encouraged to stand up as the staff moves the table away to allow for dancing. We’re dancing as the same units as the table seating was arranged in. at one point, that same man comes up and just begins dancing. He’s fairly physical - really getting in my space and standing behind me and pressing his body up against mine and dancing with me. Then he leaves. There’s a point where the dance just goes on and on. It’s a lot of shaking, like ecstatic dance. In the dream I don’t remember the dance ending and us ending up at home in our beds. So when I wake up in the dream, I think, “Wow, that’s really strange that we danced ourselves into this non-remembering place. I wonder how we got home?” We are home. Then I notice that the bracelet I had around my wrist is now in my hair. I think, “Oh, that’s a good idea, using it to tie the rest of my hair back so I can dance.” I go and look at it in the mirror and think, “Oh, it even looks good. I like the way it looks.” When I leave the bathroom, I walk down the hall and notice that I am in the physical house of my step grandmother. I remember that there’s something I’m supposed to do when I’m here. I need to meet some of the people that were at the wedding reception the previous night. So, I organize myself. I get some breakfast. I have a shower and change my clothes. My daughter and her boyfriend don’t have to do these errands, so they’re staying in the living room. They’re occupied with some other activities. When I leave to go out the front door - it is winter time in the dream - I lock myself out. In order for my step-grandma to know I’m there and we’re in the house, I move one of the bricks from the garden and put it at the front door. Then I walk across the street to the neighbor’s house who is usually always home. They know each other. I knock on the door, she comes out and I tell her what I’ve done. She says, “Oh, that’s okay. I actually have a key. I’ll just let you in.” She walks back across the street with me, we open the door, I make sure it’s not locked this time, and say goodbye to her. She returns to her own house. I walk up the street. I turn right and I go to visit someone who still lives there. There are a number of family members standing in the driveway, having a conversation. I speak to the matriarch of the family and give her a hug. We have a conversation about what everyone is doing. After this conversation is over, I continue back up the street. There’s a little girl heading towards me. She’s only about two. I’m thinking she should not be out in the winter, she doesn’t even have a winter coat on. But I turn around and one of the people from the driveway exclaims, “Oh, what are you doing? You’re supposed to still be in the house!” I realize it’s her own daughter. She goes up the street, picks up the little girl and is holding her. She says, “Oh, I remember you. The last time I saw you, I was only 9 and you were with Daren” I say, “Oh yes, I remember you.” I call her by name. She says, “Yes, that’s right. Why don’t you come in for a visit?” I agree to do that and tell her that I can only stay for a few minutes. We go into her house. It’s the house she grew up in and now it belongs to just her. She sets the little girl down, brushes her off and does the mom fingers through her hair thing. The little girl goes off to play. We sit down for a few minutes and she tells me what she’s doing. As we start to finish this conversation, another woman comes into the house whom I recognize, but I know she doesn’t recognize me. She’s lost a lot of weight and her face really looks different. I call her by name and she looks at me puzzled. I tell her who I am. She’s Daren’s youngest sister. She says, “Oh, I really don't remember you, but I remember everybody else talking about you.” It’s not a bad thing. She just knows me from conversations but doesn’t remember me visually. We have a conversation. Then I tell her I have to get going and I have these errands to run. She says, “Oh, well I’ll walk with you. I’m going the same direction.” She tells me where she’s going and it’s the same man’s place with the business card. I’m thinking, “Wow, really? I’m surprised that anyone is interested in this.” She describes it as being very popular and he’s well-respected in this area where they all live. I think, “Well, it’s on the way, maybe I’ll stop and see where his office is.” So, we do this. It’s snowing out. It’s really nice. I can feel the flakes landing on my face. It’s so cooling. Everything is just covered with this white magical veil. It’s just gorgeous. We walk to the end of the street and into this man’s office. It’s painted on the door. It looks like one of those 1940 detective show movies with the door with glass on top and name painted on the top like an arc and it has the “7 Centres” underneath. So, his name is painted in the shape of a rainbow. “7 Centres” is written vertically down and he’s got a picture of himself there. I’m laughing to myself because he’s wearing a turban and looks like a fake fortune teller. But there are other people waiting in line to see him and I’m astonished that people think this guy knows the future and all these deep secrets about them. I just can’t believe it. I also note that it’s progressed from the guy at the wedding reception handing out business cards, jollying it up with everyone, to now wearing a turban. His hair was short and grey. So the idea that he even needs a turban is ludicrous. So now I know where his office is and say goodbye to Daren’s sister. I carry on for my own errands. I go into a few shops. I’m just picking up small supplies. I go into a cheese shop and get a little tiny bit of cheese. I go into a meat shop and get a little bit of meat. Then I stop and get a few vegetables and fruit at the market. So I've got two bags in my arms and am walking back through the snow lined streets. There are no cars and nobody else walking. I can hear my feet crunching against the snow. I arrive back at my step-grandmother’s house. My daughter and her boyfriend are still in the living room. He’s doing something on a laptop and she’s doing something on a handheld device. I tell them that they need to come in and help prepare the food. I set it down and notice on the clock that there’s still two hours before we need to eat. I feel like I want to do something to keep occupied, but I don’t have anything else with me and it’s not my house. So, I go into the living room and sit down even though I know they’re both absorbed by their activities and me sitting there talking with them is not going to be welcomed. However, my daughter says to me, “Why don’t you tell Joe what your dreams have been and he’ll record them on his laptop?” I think to myself, “why would I do this? I already have my own dream journal at home?” But she’s looking at me the way you try to silently tell someone with your eyes: go, go, do it! So, I’m like okay, I guess this is meaningful, I’ll do it. So I say, “Hey, do you want to record one of my dreams?” He says, “Yeah, sure.” I tell him this particular dream and I know it's’ got a number of parts to it. I peak over to see what he’s writing. He’s written two paragraphs and they’re not as detailed as I’m telling him. What’s fascinating is there’s a part on the screen where the words are turning into characters. So, for example, one of the words describing the wedding with the people seated around, but not saying anything are now flying but don’t have mouths. Some of the words are different colors. I look and I say, “Oh my goodness! This is dream software. It’s animating my dream story!” He says, “Yeah, isn’t it cool?” I’m like, “Yes, this really is!” I ask him what it’s called and he tells me, but I don’t remember when I woke up. Then, he stops writing and he’s distracted and patting the cat’s head. He’s just recording this a lot more slowly than I can possibly speak. I feel myself getting a little frustrated that I want to get up and move, even though I’m fascinated by this software, I want to do something else while he’s not typing. So I get up and go into the kitchen. My daughter says, “Do you want him to finish or not?” I feel there’s an internal cognitive dissonance between wanting to finish and not wanting to sit there for the length of time it takes to do this. While I’m experiencing this cognitive dissonance, he gets tired of waiting for me to reply, leaves his chair and goes upstairs. Now I’m in the kitchen and thinking I might as well start prepping the vegetables. While I’m doing this, the doorbell rings and it’s this same man though he’s wearing a turban this time! He comes into the house and sits down in the living room. To my dismay, I see he’s already got my daughter sucked into his diagram of what he knows about her psyche and what he can predict from it. I’m like, “Ugh!” So I think I should sit down and make sure I hear what he’s telling her so I can protect her from his lies. As I’m listening to him, I realize he’s using some points that have some validation in the world of psychology. I’m thinking that’s what he uses as a hook to get people to believe his ludicrous claims. And then he’s also using the same colors of the chakras from yoga and saying these are the 7 energetic centres that he works with. So he’s taken something from academic psychology and some hokey stuff and woven it through the chakras, but made himself the carrier of this information, so people have to pay him and go to his centre in order to receive his wisdom that actually isn’t even his, but something he’s whipped up from other people’s work.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I had to jump all these fences like one after another after another but they were set up really close to one another, so I would jump one and literally the next fence would be one foot after it.

I went inside and met this class that was gathered inside talking about their plans for graduation. Somebody said that they were accepted to medical school, somebody else was talking about something that they learned about themselves...like an introduction and it was artificial lighting like in the science lab and for some reason it was a high school. I told everybody, “I’ll see you at the University of Connecticut,” and I was telling them that I went there for high school.

His face is heavy brow, heavy jaw, very square, heavy nose that looks like it’s been broken a few times. I’m not attracted in any way. We roll up onto this gated community. It looks like it has a bunch of duplexes in it. We roll through the gate. There’s a school - a college campus of sorts - too. I park my car and feel like I’m going to head into school or into my home. He’s like, “Hey, get in. I’m going to give you a ride.” I’m like, “I don’t need a ride anywhere.” He says, “No, I’m going to drive you someplace.” Part of me is like, “Fuck no, I don’t want to get in a car with you.” The other part of me is like, “Oh okay, I guess we’ll see where we’re going with this.” I hop in and we’re driving around. He starts telling me about his kids. We had a conversation at the grocery store about his children. I had watched him while I was at the grocery store. I was shopping, too, and it wasn’t my place of work. I had been people watching, specifically parents, and watching the way they talked to their children and noticing that parents are so controlling and rude and disrespectful of their children and didn’t let children be who they wanted me to be. I remember watching him specifically and he was really harsh and militant with his kids and I was like, “Oh my god, you’re squishing their light.” I didn’t say it out loud, but I remember thinking that. I was not impressed with the way he was parenting. I think that was my hesitation when we ended up driving next to each other, side by side. So, I got in the car anway, and we ended up talking about parenting in the car. He was driving all around this gated community and there was snow everywhere. Then he parks in some place. There's this weird potential of a sexual thing. I’m so grossed out about it. I can feel the bile rising in my throat when I think about it. He puts music on so we can dance, like he’s going to try and maybe seduce me with dancing. I’m so not having it at all. This younger woman comes out of one of the buildings we parked near. She - her skin - is all gold. She begins dancing to the music. I’m dancing to the music by myself - I’m trying to keep space between me and this dude. She’s beautiful to watch dancing. I’m loving the dancing, too. He starts to creep up on her and I’m trying to tell her to get away from him and don’t let him come up and steal your gold your light. He tries to touch her and I’m like, “Ew, no, get away!” I think she eventually moves away and off into the background. He doesn’t ever actually get to touch her, which is good. It’s now just he and me again. We get back in the car because he goes to drop me off somewhere. He does this crazy thing where he slams on the gas and then lets off the gas and he turns the car so we’re sliding. It looks and feels like a move from the movies where you see a car changing direction really fast. He goes to drop me off near my car. Now instead of it being my car, it’s a rack of bicycles that you’d found in a complex full of college kids who have only bikes to get themselves around. He drops me off there like that’s my car. I’m annoyed because it is so not my car and my car is far away from where we are. Instead, it ends up being his house. I go into the house and he goes to park his Jeep car thing. I go into the house and there’s a bunch of coolers. I think at some point, he’s going to come in and show me around the house. But I’m in the house alone and the house feels funny. It’s all white - white carpet and white walls - kind of like rentals. It looks like an 80’s house with glass window with super wide plastic blinds. The coolers are in this living room area. I have to step down two steps to get to this area because it’s one of those sunken living rooms. I go to the coolers. One of them is mine and I’m hungry, so I’m trying to dig through it. There are other coolers. One of the coolers belongs to my hula sister’s parents. The other cooler belongs to another person I know. I’m digging through trying to find food and also rearranging the coolers while I’m at it. Then this dude walks by. He’s been telling me about his wife the whole time, too. He says, “Why don’t you meet the lady of the house?” I still don’t know why I’m in this house. It feels weird. When I look up at the doors I came through, they are these huge garage doors that lead to the garage where he parked the car. There’s the number 32 sticking out from the side and I’m like, “Wow, that’s a very Harry Potter moment.” At some point, Dobby the elf from Harry Potter, shows up. It gets a bit weird. I don’t know what Dobby does, except he’s just there. I follow the dude into this kitchen and his kids are not home, but I’m wondering where they are. I’ve seen them with him at the grocery store, but they’re not here now. His wife is there. I walk into the kitchen because he’s going to introduce me to her. They’re in the middle of a conversation. His whole demeanor has changed and he’s very loving husband. He was not like that before. Before he was militant dad and when he was driving me around places and dancing, he was like weird controlling trying to seem like he knew what was going on and being sexy lover man and I was not having that. But now I’m watching him interact with his wife. He’s somewhat disrespectful. It’s like they’re both using each other and they know it, or they both know they’re faking this husband and wife thing and living in a house with kids thing, and they know it and going with it anyway. He says, “Oh my wife is so young.” Then I hear her say, “Oh, I’m so young. People always want to know how I have a 25 year old child, but I’m 19.” I’m like, “What?! The math doesn’t work.” She turns around and she does not look young. She’s in her forties and her face is pockmarked and wrinkled. She has longer blonde hair to her midback. She’s thin. Her skin is tan. She’s going on and on about how young she is and trying to explain to me the math about how she has these older kids and how when her kids were babies, she was so young and she didn’t have anyone to raise her kids with and it was hard, but now she’s very wise because she had kids when she was so young. My brain is just not computing all of this. Throughout this entire dream, “What the fuck?” is going through my head. We’re in their kitchen. The dude is sitting at an island/bar. She’s at the sink and she has turned around and is talking to me. She has poured herself a fat glass of wine - like half the bottle into a wine glass. I think she’s given him the other one. This is clearly their wind down ritual where they reconnect with each other. The whole thing is so bizarre. I wake up from the dream and am like, “Ew, why did I dream that?!”",Rose,last_nights_dream1
704,1164,,18/05/2020,05/18/2020 00:03,"I was in a tower of sorts running away from the “bad guy” - like Voldemort. I’m trying to get out of it. I have my own magic and all these stones. It’s dark in this tower and there are dark clouds all around it. The tower is made of black obsidian. There are multiple levels and stairs. The Voldemort guy locked me in the dungeon. I’m managing to make my way out and I’m going up and up this tower. I’m running and trying to get away. There is a set of elevators somewhere that I get into. I make it to this one level. It’s pretty high up. I can see out the windows and all I can see is clouds. I can’t even see the ground. There is green lightning outside. I’m still running away from this guy and he’s definitely chasing me. I make it to this place that is all windows and I can see in all directions from where I am in this room. There’s a table in the center of the room. I’m making an altar with crystals. If I can make this crystal grid and turn it on fast enough, then I can transport myself out of this. But my brother is there and he’s slowing me the fuck down. I need two of the crystals that he has. They’re tiny -the size of my pinky fingernail. They are shaped like triangles and black obsidian. He has those two stones and they’re his. I have them in my hand and he comes running up and says, “You can’t use my stones to get out of here. You’re not allowed to get out of here.” He’s somehow on Voldemort's side?! I’m like, “No, we have to get out of here! Or at least I have to. I don’t care if you like working for this guy and this is your jam. Cool. But I’m not staying.” But he keeps taking his stones off the grid so I can’t complete the grid and I can see Voldemort in his robes and walking down the hall towards me. His robes are flapping. Now there’s lightning outside and it’s getting very dramatic. I’m starting to panic because I cannot finish the grid because my brother keeps taking his stones out and I don’t have enough time to activate it. It’s like I get a few seconds with the stones on the grid and then he takes them and I can’t do it again. The dream ends with me being terrified and freaked out that I’m going to be stuck as a prisoner of this tower forever, and frustrated because I can’t get the grid to go. I know how to do this kind of magic and it shouldn’t be this hard for me.",Rose,last_nights_dream2

People are inside making crafts at a table. My friend Elizabeth has kimono fabric and is pulling gold thread out of the fabric to use as thread for a doll dress. She’s helping me make one. As I try to shut the door, two feral dogs sneak in - one black and one white. I try to push them out the door. They push back in. I push them back out and am able to lock the door. But then they’re behind me in the house and I wonder how that happened. I unlock and open the door and push them back out. This happens several times until I realize they’ve been coming in through a broken screen. I see it hanging off its hinges. So I’m trying to get them out of the house and also fix the screen. It goes on and on and I’m getting really upset. I’m also a little afraid of these dogs and what they might do to me. Then somehow I keep them out. I’m sitting at the table with the old kimono fabric. Elizabeth gives me the gold thread with needle and I start sewing the pieces together. Then someone is in the back bedroom.

Most people think they are just toys. But I realize they have consciousness and they’re watching me and everything I’m doing. They’re not good. They have a negative energy. It was like they were voodoo dolls. I was grabbing each single doll and breaking them in half. I was breaking the negative energy that was in them. But they were all around as if they were put on purpose to watch me and try and get into my field. I knew I wasn't just breaking a doll. I was breaking a being that was set there to watch me. People around me kind of thought I was being violent because I was breaking all these toys. But I knew I was breaking some dark energy or something.,Mary,last_nights_dream2
709,1165,,19/05/2020,05/19/2020 00:04,"I’m with my friend Connie from high school. We are trying to host a roundtable discussion. We’re outside and there’s a picnic table. I think there’s some sort of event happening - maybe a fair or festival or something. We’re a part of that. She’s invited a bunch of people I don't really know. She’s hosting. I’m there observing and being moral support for her. The people who show up are all black men and women. I don’t recognize any of them except for two of them. King Noire shows up again and he is with his wife, Jet Setting Jasmine. They are together and with a bunch of other black people. They’re all talking about how we live in a culture of white supremacy and colonialism. There are also some people of color, so it’s not all black people. They are sitting at a picnic table sharing a meal together. There’s food and that seems to be an important piece in this dream. I’m hungry and I want to sit down and eat, but I have this very distinct feeling that I’m not welcome. I just want to listen in and support what they’re saying and learn from them. I think I’m really not welcome here. I don’t know if these are people who would want to break bread with me and share a meal with me. So I’m standing a little far away but still trying to listen. It’s getting heated. They’re getting very annoyed and pissed off about the different aspects of running a business in our society and also just walking down the street in our society. I’m feeling all of these emotions. I’m pissed that that’s their reality and mine. I’m pissed that I feel like there’s not a whole lot I can do to help change the situation so that it’s more equal and fair for everyone. I’m also aware that I can go over there and insert myself, but that would just be more of the same oppression and white privilege. So I am at a loss at what to do, besides listen. I’m watching interactions and watching people coming and going from this table. They’re sort of wrapping everything up. I can see they’re packing up and ready to go. I have a chance where the two pornstars, King Noire and Jet Setting Jasmine, are packing their stuff up and sort of on the side. I walk over to them and say, “Hey, I want you two to know that I’ve learned so much from the two of you. I listen to the podcast that you’re on and follow your instagram accounts and all the things you teach - your sex positive families instagram account. I really appreciate all of it.” As I’m telling them this, I still feel inadequate because I don’t have any money to buy their services or donate to their Venmo or anything. I’m in this predicament of wanting to pay and not having money to pay for their services. I am hoping that they receive my appreciation. But even then I can see that maybe they wouldn’t. I just find it incredibly frustrating to be in this place. They do listen, but I can’t tell if they appreciate what I’m saying or not. Then the dream changes at that moment. I’m in this dark twilight place - definitely shadowlands. There’s a wooded forest behind me. There’s a ghost town with all these boarded up shop fronts. I’m with my kids and my younger brothers and sisters, and they’re young. I’m a young adult in this place, or I’m me. But my kids and siblings are younger - all between 5 and 10 maybe. They’re playing and they’re hungry. They want something to eat. There’s a guy and in my head I’m thinking, “oh my god, pedophile.” I don't want anything to do with him. I am trying to keep the kids away from him while they’re playing. The kids say they’re really hungry and the guy is like, “Well, I have this refrigerator full of meat. You guys can just take out of it whatever you want.” I’m hungry, too. We’re all hungry. There’s also a train on train tracks moving through this part of town. The refrigerator full of meat is stuck in the middle of an open area. I don’t even know where it’s plugged into. It’s just there. I open up the refrigerator and start opening up the doors at the bottom. The meat is raw as if it has just been cut up. I go to pull it out. But I don’t want to take the meat from this guy because I don’t think his intentions are pure. I really want to get the kids away from him. He’s standing on a porch of one of these ghost buildings and he’s watching them play. I’m like, “Don’t even watch them play.” I’m trying to round the kids up and go back into the forest where it’s safer. I don’t ever accomplish this. We end up at a picnic table. The dream shifts again. I’m talking to two of my brothers - my older half brother and the brother that’s right after me. I’m not sure what we’re talking about. We are in a different place. They’re in a house they share together, which is up a grassy hill in the neighborhood I grew up in. The grassy hill and house they are living in actually (in waking life) belong to one of the kids I grew up with. The neighborhood has some trees, but for whatever reason the area they’re in is devoid of trees. It’s important for me to see that there are no trees on their property - and this isn’t true in waking life where there are trees lining the driveway. So I’m talking to them and I’m checking in with them. But part of me doesn’t want to be talking about this with them because they’re not listening to me. They’re not hearing me. I’m not getting a say. I’m not getting to use my voice about this. They’re just telling me how things are. I’m annoyed because that’s how it always is with them - they mansplain. They’re trying to show me how they have this whole new workout set-up. They have a crazy weight room and someone welded weights for them. They are explaining to me how they do it all. One part of me is just witnessing and is excited for them. I can tell they’re excited with this little boy exuberance - their weight room, their at-home gym. The other part of me is like, “Do you guys not remember that I have a degree in exercise science and could probably make you a much better workout than what you two are doing right now?” But they’re not listening and not open to it. I’m not saying anything. I’m just listening and letting them ramble on. Now they want to talk about how I should parent. At that point the dream fades into the mist - into grey.",Rose,last_nights_dream
710,1374,,19/05/2020,05/19/2020 00:05,"“The Chandelier” This dream begins in some kind of building. I’m there because I’m teaching a teacher training, but it’s really different. The training is to help people connect to and expand their senses so that they have an expanded experience in their daily lives. I’m really enjoying using plants, food and light in the training. I’m fascinated by the process, actually. I teach every other weekend. On this particular weekend in May, May 23, I’m not supposed to be teaching. However, I have been borrowing things to use as equipment and examples - just gathering and borrowing rather than buying things to use in the teaching. This one friend of mine, Thomas has contributed something I can use in the training. He’s dropping it off athte facility where I teach as opposed to bringing it to my house. So I have to go in on my day off to meet him there. I am surprised that the doors are open and there seems to be another school going on. I’m just a little surprised because I was expecting it to be empty. But there’s another training of some sort involving children in one room and this is the room where I normally do my training. So I wait until there’s a little bit of a break and I wave to the person who is facilitating. I say, “I’m really sorry to bother you. Is it okay if I just go over here and leave some stuff in the cupboard?” She says, “Yes, that’s no problem. You can join in if you want to.” I tell her, “No thank you. It’s my day off. I just want to quickly drop this off and then I’ll be on my way.” But Thomas is not there yet. So I end up sitting off to the side and watch what she’s teaching. I think, “Wow, that's a really different approach. I love the outside the box way she’s teaching the same old thing to these students.” I feel this curiosity for and respect for her teaching method. My friend arrives. He’s got a big cardboard box in his arms and says, “I need to assemble this.” I say, “Okay, well, let’s go into one of the empty rooms so we’re not bothering anyone else.” We exit out the backdoor of the first classroom. The next room, which I also expected to be empty wasn’t. Someone is in there setting up food. It’s a break room. He sets the cardboard box on the counter that has a sink at it. I say I’ll be back in a second. I go into the first room that I left because I’ve left some bags in there. As I'm collecting them, I look out the windows and see that some of the plants I normally use have been crushed. Something has stepped on them. I’m wanting to preserve them, so I need a bucket or something I can use to dig them up and put them in so I can wash off the roots and put them in fresh soil. I ask the first teacher if she has anything. She says, “No, but there might be something in the kitchen.” So now I’ve got the plants in my hands. I’m holding onto them and I can feel how delicate the roots are when they’re not supported with the soil. There’s a little bit of urgency for me needing to find a container for them. I go back into the break room. The woman who was setting up has got a really, really big heavy urn, like 3 feet by 2 feet. It’s some kind of elaborate tea and coffee maker. My friend is helping her set them up instead of assembling what he’s brought in the cardboard box. She looks like she’s finished now. Everything is stacked up. I ask her if I can use one of the plastic cups for my plants and I show her that they need some support and I need to put them in soil or they’re going to die. She says, “I can’t give you one of these. They’re all counted for. If I give you one of these, then someone will have to go without a cup of tea.” She says that maybe there is something in one of the cupboards. I’m looking through the cupboards and can’t find anything yet. I’m starting to feel like my whole day off is becoming consumed by this task. I ask Thomas if he can expedite putting together what he’s brought in the cardboard box. He seems to be getting distracted by all the other activities and people. He says, “Okay, yes. I’ll assemble it now.” I go back into the first room and show the facilitator. She is sitting and leaning against the wall while the rest of her students are busy with activities. I show her the plants and ask her if she has a container I can put them in. She reaches underneath, opens one of the cupboard doors and gets a container and gives it to me. Now I’ve got them in a container, so their leaves won’t get crushed. But I still don’t have any soil. At this point, Thomas comes out of the back door and he’s assembled what he brought. It is 5 feet wide. He’s holding it at the top kind of like someone would hold a mobile. But it’s not a mobile. It’s a light. The light is made of tiny copper wires - they’re really quite delicate and it’s beautiful. They expand outwards and then downwards. The downward links of wire are all different lengths. Every 4 or 5 inches there’s a tiny light. So it’s a very beautiful, wide light. I’m thinking, “How are we going to get this home now that it's assembled?” He’s carrying it. Then, he asks me what it’s for. I start explaining to him. I’m feeling obligated to teach a little of what I’m using this network of light for in the training. I start telling him. One of my own students who looks like she’s just woken up from a nap comes out of another room and says, “Oh, did we have school today?” I say, “No, no, we don’t.” Then I see another one coming and she’s asking if she’s missed out on any content. I say, “No I was just telling Thomas this.” Then I realize I need to stop. Now it’s turning into a day’s teaching and it’s supposed to be my day off. So I tell them, “No, we’ll cover this next Sunday. Don’t worry.” They go back their own way. I tell Thomas, “I really need to get this home. It’s almost 3 o’clock and I want to have some time to myself.” He says, “Okay.” Now I’m carrying the little plant in the container. He’s gingerly carrying the really wide delicate light chandelier. We exit the building and go into the parking lot. He’s got a motorcycle and I’m thinking, “How are we going to carry this safely on a motorcycle? I didn’t realize that was his mode of transportation.” I say out loud, “How are we going to carry this light on the motorcycle?” He says, “Don’t worry, it will be fine.” He puts it along the inside of the passenger seat, which has a curved arm and back. He says, “You can just lean against it there.” I do. I swing my leg over and sit on the passenger seat. Now I’ve got the plant in my hand and I’m trying to protect it with my body. I’m trying not to crush the light. He gets on the motorcycle, starts it up and begins to drive really fast. I’m having a hard time hanging onto the plant. Now i look down and one of my cats is in my arms. He’s all tense and he’s trying to jump off. I’m terrified that he will because he’s really wiry and he’s big and I’ve got this plant in one hand. I’m afraid he’s going to get crushed on the highway. So, Thomas takes one of his hands off the handle of the bike and is also holding onto the cat. I can see the cat’s claw is cutting into his arm and he’s bleeding. I ask him, “Can we please pull over and arrange this so that the cat is being held firmly by someone and everything else is protected?” He does. I get a better grip of the cat and have the plant under the other arm. He starts the bike up again. I think, “Wow, I hope I can hang onto this and everyone is okay until we get home.”",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

The reason it was so hard to see the guy was because the entire dream was in black and white. Also we were in outer space where things look black and white anyway.  We had to increase speed to Warp 10 (we had a discussion about how all the ships could really go faster than they were supposed to) to get away, but even that wasn't enough.

We pointed up to the ceiling and showed her how it was buckling - it’s the kind of drop ceiling that looks white with a grid pattern- it was bulging with something that looked like pillow stuffing. We all went to get a closer look and see if we could fix it. There was also a magical component to the dream.

I see large willow trees that create sweet places to rest. I also see other trees, flowers and gardens with food growing. I am exploring the land with my son. Heather deadheads some flowers and gives my son a huge purple iris blossom. He carries it around for a while, then places it on a rock as an altar. There are natural and wild altars all around. Heather and her adult daughter live in a large tree that was once hollowed out by lightning. They have converted the inside into their home. They invite us in for tea.

718,501,,21/05/2020,05/21/2020 00:02,In my dream it was a casino (not light or dark) but it was in Mexico. I went back to my room and realized I was there with an acquaintance Charlotte on a weekend girl’s trip (both of these things the idea of a trip with her as nice as she is and a casino in Mexico are wildly outside of things I would do in real life). I went into her wardrobe and started pulling out clothes to wear. One dress reminded me of a favorite skirt I had a long time ago and I realized it was like a store - she has several sizes. She had all kinds of shoes in there and I remember seeing these weird foam flats that were labeled “spoonie shoes” and laughing in my dream because as a “spoonie” (someone with pain and chronic illness) I would wear these over the fun heels she had also brought with her. Then I got nervous- I was supposed to be watching the three dogs while my ex was out of town and he was going to be so mad that I was in Mexico. I tried to pull up my calendar and couldn’t find anything that I was supposed to do. Then I woke up.,Vera,last_nights_dream2

720,1166,,21/05/2020,05/21/2020 00:04,"I’m at work at the grocery store. I’m working in the frozen and dairy section. I’ve just arrived and I’m talking to the manager and she is giving me the rundown of all the things that need to be done today. She says, “Here’s your coat.” There’s an extra coat for me to wear because it’s cold in the freezer and she’s like, “Here’s some music you can listen to.” That’s awesome. I get ready to get all my stuff and go. I’m not sure if we’re in the breakroom when she’s giving me all this stuff. I walk out of that place. All of a sudden I have to get to the cooler to grab all the stuff out of the cooler to stock it. I’m in this gigantic huge grand ballroom. It’s like a maze. There are areas I’m trying to get through. A gala is happening. There’s a huge party. I have to go get the frozen or dairy foods for the party. I have to pull it out, so now I’m catering. It’s being put on by my brothers or a family member, maybe my mom. My mom actually does put on events in real life. So I’m trying to make my way to the cooler. It’s packed. It’s either so packed I can't move or I’m trying to obey the 6 feet distance rule and I’m having a hard time trying to get through the crowd and to the cooler. I have this cart - the carts we use in the back to load up our stuff. I’m trying to make my way, but then I hear the M.C. go: “And now, for our special guest, Arnold Schwarzenegger.” Sure enough, I look towards this doorway where people are coming in and out of. By the way, this is happening in a grand ballroom and there’s also a lawn and patio where this event is also happening. It’s a very big event. In the ballroom, the ceilings are so high I can’t even see the ceiling. The doorways are so tall, as you would see in a ballroom, that it takes a lot of effort just to open one door because the doors are so big and heavy. So these doors are open. The M.C. has announced Arnold Schwarzenegger and he walks through. What strikes me is the couple that walks before him, I think is my mom and dad, but it doesn’t look like them because these people are way tall and my parents aren’t particularly tall. Then, Arnold Schwarzenegger and his date or his wife walk through, also very tall. And then my brother and his fiancee walk through the door. My brother is just as tall as Arnold Schwarzenegger, so there are all these really tall people. I am sort of having this proud moment because I feel like this party or event is one my mom put on, but my brother is part of it and he made it happen. This was his vision and now here he is walking through the doors with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Then the next thought that goes through my head is like, “Wow, is Arnold Schwarzenegger such a B-List celebrity that he would agree to come to this gala event put on by my parents and brother?” Anyway, Arnold Schwarzenegger looks older, but not as old as he looks now. Then I am back to trying to get to the cooler so I can grab the stuff and bring it out for this party. The dream switches here. It goes from a beautiful gala party event with flower party arrangements and gold on the doors and on the walls, and the beautiful sconces and chandeliers, and just a very opulent setting to kind of dark, at least the lighting gets dark. I am watching these other people try to take over the ball. They have headsets on and they’re in a room where they’re watching everything on screens. They are trying to manage the ball from behind the scenes. They’re letting this centipede like creature with a round body- it’s like a toy from the 80s, that you could build bugs with, their bodies were really round and they have these yellow curly cue tongues and antennas and yellow peg legs you can put into the round bodies and make whatever size bug you wanted from these things. So, that’s what I’m watching these people do - they are going to let this bug loose on the party. But it’s a super poisonous bug like a centipede with a ton of legs. I’m still trying to do my part. But now I realize I need to stop this bug because if they let this bug go and it stings everyone, it’s going to be chaos and it’s not good. In my mind I think this bug is going to kill people. So I actually pick it up behind it’s first bulbous round head thing. It’s trying to move through the party, going back through the doors the others came out of. It’s getting bigger and smaller, changing size. When it’s in its small phase, I pick it up and it leaves one of its segments behind. I’m just really horrified that this bug is being let loose and I’m trying to contain it. When I do pick it up, it shrinks down to its toy size, even though it leaves its segments behind. But it’s still really poisonous. I don’t want the front end of it to get anywhere near to me - kind of like when you grab a snake behind the head so it can’t bite you, I’m trying to keep it from biting me and everyone else. There’s a little bit of panic and suspicion now going through the party. It was very joyful and joyous with the clink of china and all that stuff happening to silence and panic and fear, definitely fear. And the lighting is now dark.",Rose,last_nights_dream

727,1167,,22/05/2020,05/22/2020 00:06,"Two dreams, the deeper dream then the one that’s easier to remember. The deeper dream I think is a man and me - I think it’s my ex-husband. We’re in a house. This person is Santa Claus. He’s responsible for bringing joy to children, but it looks like my ex and not Santa Claus. We’re in a house and all around the house is white tundra, so North Pole’ish. It starts out as a gigantic mansion. I’m me, but I don’t think I’m female. It’s like we’re two friends. This guy has a role - an important job. It almost feels like I’m freeloading because there isn’t anything I’m doing. He points it out, “You don’t even have a job. You don’t even have a purpose, really.” I’m like, “Ooh, that feels gross. I need to go find my purpose.” Then it shifts from this gigantic mansion place that is super opulent with gold, wall sconces, chandeliers, and gigantic floor to ceiling windows that are at least two stories tall. I think I’m standing on this huge staircase at some point. Then the mansion shrinks down to this smaller house. Now it is my ex and me. I don’t know that I’m female yet. I think I’m still his friend - I’m a dude. There are a bunch of kids that he’s supposed to be caretaking or bringing the light to. I think they’re maybe ours. The vibe between the two of us is weird. He’s definitely holding the power over me. But I’m like, “You’re supposed to be caretaking these kids and I’m actually doing all the work here. You’re not fulfilling your role.” So he says to me, “Well let’s talk and work this out.” So while we’re trying to talk, we’re also doing - we’re moving through different rooms in the house, cleaning or packing to go on a trip. We’re packing things in one room of the house. Then we’re moving to the kitchen and I’m packing up food and he is doing stuff. The kids are following us around the house observing what’s going on. Also we give them small chores to do as we move through rooms in the house. At some point I’m like, “When are you going to stop and hug the children? When are you going to love on them? They’re wanting our attention, but you just keep giving them these chores to do and sending them off. But what they really want is a hug and some love.” I ask him that and he gives some sort of weird answer. The implication is that he’s not going to touch or comfort them. I’m left to do it. Then it’s time for the kids to get in the sleigh or the car. They start walking out the door and there’s quite a few kids - not just 2, but 10. He and I are alone for a second and it’s like, “Can we get real now and talk about what’s going on and this weirdness?” He says to me something that is pretty profound, but I can’t remember it. After he says this, I don’t feel like there’s been any resolution. I don't feel myself softening towards him. Then the dream totally shifts. I’m an observer. I’ve popped into this observer role. There’s an airport and a huge airplane being loaded - lots of people getting on. There are two guys left. I see a ramp or part of the landing gear. This guy is in shorts, tennis shoes and a long sleeve shirt tied around his waist. He’s up on the ramp and the plane takes off. You hear the pilot or flight attendants say, “Okay everyone, you need to get in the plane now. Get all the way in.” This guy is like, “I’m going to ride the plane from here!” It’s him and another guy on it. The second guy is dressed in one of those flying squirrel suits and has goggles over his eyes. He’s got a plan - he’s going to do something as this plane takes off. And he does. As the plane gets to altitude, he jumps off, flies off and goes to wherever he’s going. The other guy who is in shorts and tennis shoes and a long-sleeved shirt tied around his waist, his goal is to ride out the entire plane ride on this ramp. Part of me wonders if they’re going to pull this ramp in because you can’t fly a plane with this ramp hanging off. But this guy’s goal is to ride on this ramp to wherever this plane is going. His goal is to break some record. I’m observing all of this, neither in the plane nor on the ramp. But I’m thinking he’s going to freeze to death because it’s going to be so cold at altitude, and he’s going to burn his skin to death because he doesn’t have sunscreen or a shirt on or anything on his face and he’s close to the sun. Hello?! And there’s no oxygen. How is he going to do this? This man is so unbothered by all of it. He’s not scared that he’s going to let go of the ramp and fly off. He’s not scared that he’s going to fall. He’s not worried that he’s too close to the sun. He's not worried that he’s too high up. He’s not worried that there’s not enough oxygen. He’s incredibly unbothered and so relaxed that he actually takes a nap at some point on this ramp as the plane is flying. In my head I know none of this is possible and he would have blown off the ramp a long time ago. But then the plane lands. He lands with the plane. Where the plane lands, there are a bunch of other planes and guys. There are men everywhere and not a single female to be found. It was clearly some kind of competition happening. They’re all patting each other on the back and congratulating each other. They’re in different pods. An M.C. comes out and you can hear over the loudspeakers someone say, “And the winner for being most exposed to the elements…” They announce the name of the winner, but it’s not my guy, even though he should have won. You see him be super crestfallen. But everyone else is cheering the winner. The other guy that was in the squirrel suit is there, too. He was also part of a competition - it was about getting to a certain place in the most difficult way. I’m like, “Dude, my guy on the ramp totally wins because he did not have any fancy gear. He was just in his keds and shorts on a ramp.” Somebody from the airplane finally speaks up and says, “Actually, I think it was this guy who really won. He wasn’t really registered and no one took note of him, but he rode this plane the entire time and never fell off.” All of a sudden, the judges come together and confer. The M.C. gets on the microphone and says, “There’s been a change. The winner is this guy!” It’s my guy who was on the ramp the whole time. You see his face light up and he’s exuberant in a quiet humble way. He’s not loud like the other guys. I get the sense that he was on a spiritual journey. Yes, he won the competition, but what he was really looking for was for God to acknowledge him, “Yes, my son, you did this.” It ends with everyone cheering him and him with a really big smile on his face and really humble. I’m wondering how any of that was possible.",Rose,last_nights_dream
728,1375,,22/05/2020,05/22/2020 00:07,"“Step-Motherhood” This dream I seem to be a step-mother to two different families. It starts off and I’m actually unclear on whether I am the first group of kids’ actual mother or if I’m their stepmom, but I’ve been with them for some time. There’s three boys and a girl. We do live alone. There’s no man in the house. The boys are all teenagers and they’re very close in age, like 17, 16 and 15. The girl is a little bit younger, but also a teenager, perhaps 12 or 13. They’re all in various stages of self-sufficiency and they are aware that we need to be moving soon as I am. Then the scene switches a little bit and I’m at another house. The house is actually quite spectacular. It’s a farmhouse style that has had a lot of work done to modernize it and continue to hold its beauty. It’s not in a town, but there are a few other houses around. It feels like some other people have also chosen not to live in an urban setting and are perhaps because of their own independence, wanting to live off the land and make similar choices, they may be in the early stages of a rural community. But I don’t feel that it’s happened quite yet. You can just see that there are other landowners around. The house has a big wide decking around it so you can stand on it before entering. It also feels like it adds to the safety and the way the house is heated and cooled by night and day through this deck and the roof. It’s like a wide, deep and covered porch. The roof is tiled. The kitchen is interesting, too. There’s a fireplace in the very center. There’s a big big wide beam that splits the kitchen in half at the ceiling. The table is built to hug the fireplace and wrap around it in a C-shape. I also notice the water tank attached to the fireplace. I haven’t quite figured out how it heats the water in the kitchen, but it does. The dream begins with me. I’m at the table. There are four girls and one boy. The boy is the oldest, probably 11 or 12. The youngest girl is still a baby, maybe 1, possibly 10 or 11 months old. The mom isn’t there. I’m not clear if she died or if she left, but she’s just not there. But she must have been there recently because the youngest is really young. I’m supposed to be getting to know these kids. I’m having a hard time keeping their names straight because there are so many of them and they never sit still for very long. The dad is there at the moment. He’s asked me to bathe them. There’s a system set up with a pipe that runs up from the fireplace, across the ceiling, down into the room that’s the bathroom and into the bathtub faucet. I open up the spigot that releases some of that water and am carefully mixing the cool water with the hot water, putting my hand in there and I only fill it about 3 or 4 inches because the little girl is very young. Then I pick her up from the dinner table and take her into the bathroom. At this point, I really get to see her face. She’s this bundle of joy. She’s innocent. She’s happy - you can feel the bubbles of happiness radiating out from her body and she’s completely trusting of me. Now I can remember her name because I can feel her energy and see her face. So I take her clothes off and I set her gently in the tub and am starting to wash her. The dad comes in and checks on us. He says something to me, but I don’t know what it is, then he leaves the room. I take the little one out of the bathtub and dry her off. I wrap her in the towel and go back into the kitchen. The dad is there. It’s like he’s not clearly outlined. I see that he’s at the sink washing dishes. The kids are rowdy as they sit around the table because no one is really with them and they’re finished eating. Food is still on the table. I get the next oldest daughter who is a little over 2. I take her by the hand and bring her into the bathroom. Then I put the little one back in. she’s sitting safely in the bathtub. Then I tell the next youngest one: “We might as well get you ready so that you can have the next bath.” I see her face and she looks different from the first child. She’s quite a bit darker and has a different character. I can feel how energetically different this child is from the first one. She’s not as trusting. She’s a lot more independent. We get her sweater off and her top and her shirt and her shoes and socks. Then I think this is going to be a challenge. The bath water from the first one is still quite clear. The other one didn’t have anything on her - there were no food bits or dirt. So the bath water is still clean and I think I’ll just warm it up a little bit and add some bubbles, then put the next daughter in. I do this. Now I’ve got both of them in the bath at the same time. I’m washing the second one. The second one has hair so I’m rinsing it with clear water from the tap. I realize that now the water is going to get too deep for the baby. I take her out and wrap her in her towel again and put her on the floor beside me. I think, “Okay, how am I going to do this? There are still three more kids to have baths. Who’s going to look after the first two?” Then the dad comes in and I’m relieved. I tell him that the youngest one is finished. He takes her with him. I finish bathing the second daughter. He brings in the third one and leaves her at the door. I coax her in. She’s a little more standoffish and it’s taking some time for me to talk to her. Then the scene changes from the bathroom. I’m outside with them. I’m showing them a raised garden bed that belongs to me. So I know what’s in there. I’m saying, “Look, this starts as a seed. See how it hasn’t grown up yet? It will soon if we water it and give it some sunlight.” I hand them a watering can and they pour some water on it. Then I say, “Look, this one is already grown! It already has some fronds on it.” I clip off two fronds and say, “Here, rub the leaves a little bit and then smell it.” They do. It’s lavender. They really like this and both of them are smiling now. They’re happy and engaged with the garden. I ask them if they want to bring in this and put it in the bath water. They say yes. Now they’re both excited. So we go back into the house and back into the bathroom. Now those two are bathed. I changed the water when we got back in. They’re playing happily in the bathroom with me. It’s fine. They don’t need the kind of support the 1-year-old did where you had to hold her and do everything else with one hand. They’re playing together on the bathroom floor. I change the bath water and put in fresh bubbles. I put them both in the bathtub at the same time and wash their hair. I take them out and dry them off. I’m wondering where the dad is. I go out to the kitchen. The older girl and the boy are not at the table, but the dishes have all been taken away and the table is clean. So i’m wondering where to go next with them. I go the opposite way of the bathroom. There’s a large living room with a fireplace. It’s sunken a little bit and there are bedrooms off to the side. The girls just run into their own room. I think, “Oh, this is where they sleep.” I don’t know if I’m a nanny or what. I’m starting to feel more like a nanny, like a governess. So I help them put their pajamas on, put them into bed, read them a story, and say goodnight. Then I come out and the dad has put the baby to bed. He’s saying, “Okay, we’ve got a little bit of a breather here. The older kids can bathe themselves. Then just make sure they go to bed.” I say, “Okay, got it.” Then I go back into the bathroom because I still have to clean up from the older twos’ bathing. I pull the plug. The dad comes up behind me and gives me a big hug from the back. I can feel his heart rate and his breath. There’s heat between us. I think, “Oh, that’s what this is? Am I stepmom?” I feel a little confused. The heat is really good and I can feel my body responding. I soften into him and allow this. It lasts for a moment, then he releases me and leaves the room. Then he’s gone from the house and I get the idea that he works nights. I let the older two know that the bathroom is clean and they come in and do their own thing. I’m not witness to this. Then they’re in their pajamas and are sitting in the living room. Now we’re having a conversation with my own kids from the previous family where I was mother or step-mother or nanny. They are all sitting around. My kids from the first group are older. The kids are deciding whose room is going to be whose and who has to double up. They’re having this independent conversation. It seems to be working out. Now there’s a top floor to this house overtop the living room. That’s where the rest of the bedrooms are. So they work it out. All of them go to bed up there. Now the dream speeds up in time. I am looking after all of these kids by myself. I’m making their meals, we’re doing some kind of life skills activities during the day involving the garden and teaching them how to cook. There’s water that needs to be filled up in this complex system of rainwater catchment that’s heated by the fireplace and dispersed. Some of the girls are filtering the water and putting it in quart-sized containers for drinking water. It feels as though I have done this for about 10 days, I’m thinking, “Wow, how long is the dad’s night shifts?” I see him one morning. The kids are all happy to see him. Now there doesn’t seem to be any difference between the first group of kids and the ones that were clearly his. I say to him, “How many more night shifts do you have?” He says, two. I say, “Oh good. I was really hoping for some help here.” He has a bag of photography equipment in his hand and he says, “It’s picture day.” At this point I realize we need a backdrop. I’m tasked with going to the hardware store to get one. There’s a truck and I drive to the hardware store and get out. There’s this great big huge rack of backdrops. It’s like 8 feet long and 5 feet high. I choose one and am wondering how to get it out to the door without bending it. The employee appears to help me. She says she’s already rang it through. It doesn’t seem possible, but I take it out of the rack and it goes through the door and into the truck. It just fits. I get back to the farmhouse and take it out. Now I’m tacking it to the side of the house. Now there’s a piece of stucco ceiling. We’re outside. We’re getting ready to take pictures of the kids. He thinks the younger ones are going to be difficult, but they just come up and they’re happy. He says, “How did you get them to do that together?” I say, “Oh, well we have this garden. I’ve got a garden in the back and we’ve been growing things. They really like it.” So the kids automatically go and get the herbs I showed them. They pick their favorites and bring them over. Then, click, click, click, the pictures are all taken and it’s really easy. Then the dad is finally next. It’s his turn. He’s lying on his back with his knees bent. I say, “Oh just a second. I’ve got a kit for that in my car.” I go out and get it. They are small pieces of carpet I’ve cut out especially to cushion heads and sacrums. There are just two. I tell him to lift up his head and I put one under there. Then I tell him to lift his sacrum and I put one under there. Then I’ve got something different for the background. It’s made of some kind of fabric. I’ve got a tin of thumbtacks. I’m trying to push the thumbtacks into the wall. But just as I get to the end, the first one falls out. So he gets up and tacks it, only he uses the ceiling instead of the wall. I say, “Oh, how did you do that?” He shows me the end of the tack. I see that it’s one of those things to replace Christmas ornaments - they come off and you can buy a package of separate ones. He has these in the tack instead and they fit into the ceiling. So I put one on mine and it goes into the ceiling like butter. I’m surprised. It works. Just as I’m about to turn around and go back to the camera, there he is behind me and there’s all this heat.

735,505,,23/05/2020,05/23/2020 00:02,"I was with my sister and her soon to be ex husband and we went to watch a parade but we had to stay in a big van and keep changing spots. My cousins were there, actually a lot of my dad’s side of the family was there. My finger was on the ground. There were cigarette butts on the ground. My finger was there from last year and I thought to myself that it was too late to reattach it. The parade came and my friend Emily came out of the window across the street all dressed up in an old school dress, dancing and having fun with two other women. They were having fun and yet on our side we were cramped in this van. The parade was a funeral and a big brass band was playing and the song was my favorite cover for a brass band (in real life) and also my mom’s favorite (she’s passed but she loved Allison Krauss version). The song is “I’ll fly away.” Suddenly I realized we were at a funeral and the second line was coming. I went to go get something from the back - I think it was something to write with - and lost my space at the front where I could see. I wanted to get out but the finger and cigarette butts were on the ground (I do not smoke in real life). It was dark and swampy, not day or night. It was later and I was in New York and there were flashing signs and grey gravel streets and I was with someone, a younger black man who had short braids in his hair, he was medium build and we were looking for someone at a scene. We were in the ruins of something and I thought we were uptown or in BK but then I realized we were closer to 90th street. I used to live on 89th in real life. I was back on the ground somewhere picking up trash and frantically trying to clean up this backyard dirt area where there were cereal boxes and cigarettes, and shove them into black trash bags.

There was a conference - somebody was giving a talk and we were there for that talk. We had to get on a tram to get to the airport lounge to get on our plane. I’m there where I’m supposed to be. But two or three of my siblings are not there. We can’t find them. I’m starting to get stressed because they haven’t met us where we’re supposed to all be. The communication between my parents and siblings is shit. No one is telling anyone what they need to know. Part of it is we either don’t have our cell phones or don’t have service. There’s an actual physical communication breakdown, but also distance. Some siblings wander off and miss the tram they’re supposed to be on and don’t show up where they’re supposed to go. I get two or three of my siblings and we show up where we’re supposed to go, but then we realize we’re in the wrong spot or the gate has been moved. We have to get back on another tram and go back to where we had come from, or so I think. We go and we do it. My parents and my grandma finally get a hold of us and are like, “No, you could have stayed where you were at. Now it’s going to take you longer to get where you’re going and you’re possibly going to miss this plane or tram.” I’m not sure which - plane or tram. There is a lot of back and forth, not going to the right place, not finding each other, not communicating well. We realize we are retracing steps we didn’t need to retrace. We didn’t have to go back to the place we went back to. It would have been better if we stayed where we were, or even better, moved forward. This moving forward is just a vague sense or feeling that there’s a moving forward that could happen. But trying to get me, all my siblings, my parents and my grandma all in one place so that we can all travel together is just not happening. Two of my siblings are pissed at me for leaving them behind even though they wandered off - they took it upon themselves to go elsewhere and then were mad at me that I didn’t take them with me when it was time to go. So lots of feeling of frustration and herding cats, then me going like, “Hey, wait a second, you all are adults. I’m not responsible for you! Yes you’re my younger siblings. But you are adults who can get yourself where you need to go. So I don’t need to worry about this so much!” That was the overall tone of the dream.",Rose,last_nights_dream
738,1376,,23/05/2020,05/23/2020 00:05,"“The Bicycle” I’m in my paternal grandparents’ house. I’m upstairs. There’s a window at each end of the hallway. The hallway is really wide. One end looks out onto my grandmother’s rock garden and the other end looks out across a meadow and down towards the next house, which is quite a ways away. It’s a big picture window. My grandfather always had a desk there with a blotter on top of it. In my dream, instead of a blotter, there's a big square shallow box the size of the blotter, maybe only an inch deep. Inside of it is a whole bunch of compartments, about the size of business cards. There must be 60 of these little compartments. Some have business cards in them. Other ones have tiny notepaper. On one is written a name and a phone number. It says, “Herod” and a phone number. Suddenly I see my dad writing the number down. But there’s no phone on the desk. Then my dad is gone again and I’m just looking at this myriad number of business cards. They are all of different designs and I’m looking at the colors and the designs. Then I realize it’s time to go. My dad and Uncle Kevin are there. I go downstairs into the kitchen. My dad is putting my Uncle Kevin’s bicycle in the back of the car. He’s driving him. Suddenly, we are in the city, in Toronto. My dad and my uncle are in the car. But I'm riding my Uncle Kevin’s bicycle. It’s a little bit too big for me. So when I am forced to stop at red lights, I have to put one foot on the ground and tip the bike over because the seat is so high that my feet don’t touch the pedals and I have to put them on the ground. I’m trying to follow them, but they go through the light and I get stuck at the red light. I go for two blocks. Then I don't want to keep doing this. So I just let them go and I decide to go back to where we came from. So I turn the bicycle around in the street. It’s really busy. There’s a lot of traffic and cars parked on either side. I miss the turn and I realize I’ve missed the turn. I wonder how I could have missed it because I only went for one block. But I have. I think, “Where we came from, I’ll still find it because the streets are like a grid. So if I turn right, then turn left, I should be able to run into the same street, then I’ll just turn left again and I’ll be back where I started from.” Only it doesn’t turn out that way. I think I’ve had this dream before. This same dream where I’ve missed that same turn and not been able to find where I was going. Then I keep riding and riding. I’m not anywhere I recognize. Then that dream melds into the one I had before where I’ve taken the wrong turn before, only my dad is with me. We’re both trying to find our way back to where we’re going. We think there’s a shortcut through a hotel. We go in it and it’s like we’re in an underground parking lot. The parking lot has an internal walkway - the way you would go from one building to another in a big city and you just go up to the street level. We do that. But it keeps not turning out to be where we thought it was supposed to be. Then the dream melds back into the one where I am doing it and my dad is in the car with Uncle Kevin. I think, “Oh, this is that same place that I came with my dad.” So I realize I do need to go back because I’ve done it with him before and not found anything. So I turn around and go back and go all the way back down the street and go into a different building. Now I’m on foot, no longer on my Uncle Kevin’s bicycle anymore. I’m stuck in this crowded lobby. There’s a woman behind me and she’s pushing me with her body because she’s trying to butt in front of me so she can be with her friend who’s turned around and is talking through me to her. I’m annoyed by this. I’m trying to move sideways so she can stand beside her friend instead of pushing me. But there are so many people I can’t even move out of her way. She pushes me forward. They get on a bus and then I’m free of them. I start walking up that same street again and am thinking, “I’m still not going to be able to get home because I’m on this same street.”",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I forgot that sometimes I dream about him but it’s been awhile. He was silent most of the time. I showed up with a group of people - a woman and an older woman who was like her mother or grandmother of Asian descent and then another younger woman. I can’t remember if I know her in real life. I really had to use the bathroom and there was this joke that every time I had to use the bathroom the older woman would cut me off but I didn’t have to use the bathroom when I woke up in real life I went back to sleep and I continued to dream. I dreamed I walked into a bathroom and I looked in the mirror and I was wearing three sports bras. It looks like they were on backwards almost but I checked and they weren’t, they were just really high on my chest and I want to try to use the toilet but it was a strange strange toilet and looks like a tub filled with water and I didn’t want to pee in that and so I thought maybe I should wait. Then William came in and I asked him and he said that I could use the toilet in the other room. He pulled back a door and there was an old-school old-fashioned regular toilet and I realized I was in a future, but I was also in the past. We planned to hook up later.

744,846,,24/05/2020,05/24/2020 00:04,"At the last minute, Burning Man is happening this year. It’s very low key, but still in the desert. You just arrive and buy tickets at $15/person. You can also purchase rooms for $10/night. I go with my husband. We park the car on the side of the road, then walk through rusted out picked apart cars and airplanes with a bunch of white men smoking and drinking beer. We see our friends Diane and Warren in line. Diane offers to buy our tickets. I think it’s so nice of her. I then wonder what we’re going to do about our sleeping situation. We didn’t bring sleeping pads or blankets, so we’ll be sleeping in the car through the cold night and just throwing clothes over us. Now I think we might be able to afford a night or so in the hotel because Diane bought our tickets. We are walking through the festival. It’s more like a regular festival with vendors rather than Burning Man’s creative form of energy exchange and generous artistic sharing. As we continue to walk, we end up on a concrete street with hotels and office buildings. My husband looks up into a window and it’s cracked by a bullet hole. There is blood splattered all over the window. We don’t know if it just happened or if it’s been there a long time. We also don’t know if it’s an artistic expression of some kind. We don’t know if or how or where to report it and we keep on walking. But I have a feeling someone is dead in the hotel bathtub up there. Diane looks at a building on our side of the street. She exclaims about the black and green obsidian architectural accents on the building and around the windows. She thinks it would be wonderful to live in such a place because of the protection afforded by this stone. I think it’s beautiful, too. I like the idea of living in a place like that. We keep on walking. Then we are at the exit point of the festival where we get food to go and catch a bus to go back to our car. We’ve done this a couple days already and have our favorite dishes. I have been picking up a noodle bowl with a friend of mine (who I don’t know from waking life). We’re either really early or really late. The guy who makes our noodle bowl sees us and he secretly makes our food. But he can’t give it to us yet. So I go to the front and my friend stays and waits for our food. I’m waiting for him. The food is delivered to him, but then he never returns to me. It is revealed to me that he was trying to find me, but he stepped out into the road and was run over and killed by a car. All that’s left of him is a small clump or rat hair and crushed rat bones in the gutter. I’m concerned but not very upset. It seems more strange than awful. Then my stomach is not feeling up to eating, but I know I need to eat. I stand in line at a deli counter and ask if they serve hot sandwiches. They hand me a menu and I’m also trying to squint at and read the menu on the wall. I can’t read either, but they tell me they don’t make hot sandwiches for dinner but not now, so I go on. I go to the back where there is a bakery. I stand at the counter and no one else is there. The baker and owner of the bakery comes out from the back. He loves everything about baking. He’s telling me about all the ethnic baking styles he does. I say I want something warm and hot. He asks me what I like. I say I like hot. He asks me what kind of hot and I say “spicy.” He asks me what kind of spicy and I say “warm spicy.” I’m not giving him a clear idea of what I like. He shows me a tray of baked goods and invites me to try it. I love it. I’m sitting on the side nibbling on this savory dish. Then a big group of people arrives and they start looking at all the sweet dishes. One person comes and sits next to me and eats their dish. I go up to the front and see they have a tray of sugar glazed sticky buns in the shape of mice. They tell me these are covered with raspberry sauce and filled with blueberry cream. So I take one and they ring me up at the register. They tell me it’s $12. I’m surprised that one pastry would cost so much. I tell them I already paid for the savory treat. They don’t really believe me, but then the owner comes out and tells them I did pay, so I only owe a few bucks. I feel nourished and I feel good about this exchange.",Ana,last_nights_dream1

So I’m still under the covers and undressed. There are a lot of people on their mats and ready for class. But it’s not very organized. I start to teach even though I don’t know who they are or where we are or what I’m going to teach. There are also people in the back of the studio in private massage rooms. One person is the studio owner and it’s just so odd. So I’m trying to teach and put the students in poses so they aren’t looking forward at me, so I can put on a t-shirt and my bra. I keep messing up with the bra over the shirt or sleeves and everything is just a mess. I’m trying to teach a lunge with breath of fire, but I can’t get the directions clear without demonstrating. I try to explain it over and over again and it’s so frustrating for everyone. Finally I get my shirt on and I demonstrate and instruct at the same time. They get it at last, but it doesn’t seem worth the effort. I continue with the sequence. I walk to the back and someone points out to me that the water heater is leaking into the walls and there is a huge red stain on the wall. It’s coming from the massage room where the yoga studio owner is practicing behind the curtain. I continue teaching while I’m investigating the mess and my mind is split. The yoga studio owner is under the sheets and undressed, but still taking my class. I decide I can’t continue this investigation while I am also teaching. So I go up to the front and think I need to teach. I see that there is a student up front preparing to teach a sequence from her notebook. She sees me and says that I can continue. I look at her notebook and see that she has written and doodled a pretty advanced and creative sequence. I realize these students are more advanced and I was teaching a very basic class. I tell her I’ll bring them to a certain pose, then hand the class over to her to complete. I bring them all into a wide-legged forward bend, then glide side to side. I give them an option of lifting into a headstand. Some press up into a handstand. One of the students is my friend, Carrie. She is doing a handstand by the fireplace with one foot on the mantel and her butt balanced on a little table. She calls me over and tells me that she needs to talk to me about her handstands. I go over to her and pass the teaching to the student up front.",Ana,last_nights_dream2
746,1169,,24/05/2020,05/24/2020 00:06,"Holy shit, this dream. And dreams within dreams. The deepest dream starts with me and all six of my high school classmates - two or three women and two or three men. They’re putting on a hula show for an audience. I don’t know who is in the audience. I haven’t learned it yet. I’m like, “What the fuck? How don’t I know this? Why didn’t you teach me? Out of all of us, I’m the actual hula dancer.” They are like, “Well, because you dance hula, you’ll be able to pick it up. But we’re going on stage now.” I’m like, “Eh, right.” I say, “I don’t have the costume. Can you at least dance it for me at least once?” They find lei for me and costume for me. Interestingly enough, the costume is a bleached white pareo on the bottom. I don’t know what we have on top - I think nothing, just lei and lei on our head and kupe’e on our wrist and feet. I keep saying, “Can you show me the dance? Where in the lineup do I need to be for all of this?” We’re heading out onto the stage. The stage has maybe two inches of water on it and water all around it. The audience is on the other side of the water. We’re going to be dancing in the water. But I still don’t know the dance all the way, and none of my classmates are forthcoming. I get the sense that they’re bummed that I showed up and they were going to do the dance without me. They didn’t want me there. The reason they didn’t teach it to me is that they didn’t want me there upstaging them. This is such a strange thing in my mind. I don’t understand in my mind why as a class we’re presenting this hula to everyone and they’re trying to keep me out of it. Then the dream shifts to me being an observer. There is a dream oracle - he's like Edward - and a husband and wife. The wife looks like Julia Roberts. The man looks like a very stereotypical college professor type white man with the sweater and the khakis and loafers and glasses. This couple has come to see this dream oracle. They’re in a library - the dream oracle’s personal library with floor to ceiling books and lots of gold. It’s really ornate with all kinds of filigree style decorations of wall sconces and velvet chairs. It’s very opulent. The dream oracle is going to help them work through their dreams. The dream oracle explains to them how dreams work. You can see the man is very, very skeptical. But the wife is like, “Of course, it totally makes sense that dreams work this way - that they are hidden messages with multiple layers and that they come from other realms.” The husband is like, “Whatever, this is a bunch of bullshit.” This is where there is a dream within a dream. I watch them go into a dreamstate. In the dreamstate, the husband and wife are very lovely dovey. They’re in an open field with clouds. The husband just goes psycho. There’s another man there. I’m not sure who or what he is. The husband turns into a psycho as his wife watches. His true nature comes out in this dreamstate. He’s not just an animal, he’s cruel. This other man that shows up in the dream, he cuts his head off. The blood sprays all over the wife. The wife starts to freak out. This is where they’re in the dream together. So even though she’s freaking out, I can hear her say, “This is just a dream, it’s not real.” The husband is trying to kiss her, but he’s very violent about it. He’s grabbed her hair. He’s covered in blood and he has a knife in his hand from when he cut the head off the other person in this dream. They come out of the dream together. They’re back in the dream oracle’s study. She’s horrified. I'm horrified. I’m looking at the husband and can tell that the dream completely revealed who he actually was. Maybe it was just a dream, but maybe it was the realest thing because now they can see who the husband is. He’s this violent guy, not the stereotypical well-spoken professor that he showed up as. Then the dream shifts. I’m no longer an observer. I’m back in my body. There’s a woman. She’s older than me. In this part of the dream, I’m younger, maybe 12 or 13 at least. She has a ton of books. She’s selling books. I’m outside with her. The books are on this round wooden table with a single leg in the middle. She goes door to door selling books and she’s showing me how to sell books to make money. She has dark hair that touches her shoulders. Her face is friendly. I get the sense she is not of this world. I’m trying to take in everything she says about selling the books, but I have this weird sense that things are not as they seem. I have my bicycle and there’s a little basket on the front. It doesn’t have any gears - it’s an old-fashioned bike with a banana seat. I’m putting some of the books in the front so we can go door to door and sell these books. I don’t know exactly what’s in them. She’s trying to tell me what’s in them, but I’m not remembering. So I’m younger in this part of the dream, but then the dream goes forward and now I’m probably 18-12. I’m college-aged. Now I’m with Josh, current lover in waking life, and his girlfriend. We’re all going to college together. He’s registering for courses. I’m wondering why I’m here because I’ve already been to college and don’t like college. I already have two degrees and don’t want to be here. What’s heartbreaking for me is that he’s with his girlfriend and they’re registering for classes together and I hear him say, “And there’s so many people here to meet and sleep with!” I’m like, “Okay, well, I’m going to register for all my classes.” The thought crosses my mind, “Why are you even here with him registering for classes? You’ve already got your degrees? And why are you registering for all of these undergrad courses. If you’re going to go back to school, get your PhD.” My response to that is like, I don’t want to do that. I don’t need a PhD. I don’t need to go to classes to get a PhD. I don’t know why I’m here. I’m only here because I followed this guy here. And now he’s off and encouraging me to go meet a bunch of people. But I’m like, I don’t need you to tell me that. I don’t need your permission. I’m questioning why we’re even here together. I decide to write the whole thing off and try to make it my own. The dream shifts one more time. College is still part of it. Now my mom is here. She’s like, “Hey honey, I got you some shoes. They were giving shoes away to low income people.” I guess I qualify as a low income person. I’m like, “Well, I don’t know if I need any shoes.” But I look. They’re these oxfords with the heel and front toe a dark maroon and the rest of the shoe is light pink. The colors go well together and the shoes are cute for low income. But I’m not expecting any shoes. I don’t need any shoes. I don’t feel like a low income person and don’t know why I need these shoes. They’re cute but I don’t actually want them. I wake up thinking that I don’t want any of this. I feel like I’m not following my path. I recall how the woman selling the books was telling me I need to do my own thing. I had this sense of frustration and my jaw was tight and tired as if I was grinding my teeth in the dream because I was playing catch up or doing something I didn’t want to do or I’m doing something that is not at my level. I get the sense that I’ve learned all this stuff and am repeating all of these patterns, but it’s time to move on and stop taking what’s offered to me as if there aren’t other things being offered to me or other things I could be taken advantage of. The feeling of being irritated stays with me.",Rose,last_nights_dream

I pick it up and now I’m carrying two phones that look exactly the same. I also have a card in my hand - I’m not sure if it’s a credit card or an identification card. I also have a set of headphones in my hand. I look down at one of the phones and see it is 7:11pm. That’s not good because I need to get my son to sleep. I start to run. I’m wearing black platform flip flops. I’m surprised at how steady I am on my feet. I look around and see that this is not a safe place to be alone especially as it is getting dark. I turn left and suddenly I’m in my hometown again. I’m in front of my friend Jeremy’s house. The door is open and I’m carrying an empty pizza box. I see my friend Pema through the window and hear them speaking Gaelic fluently. Pema sees me. I walk into his house and then turn around and walk right out as if I didn’t mean to go in.

753,1377,,25/05/2020,05/25/2020 00:05,"“Alien Lover” In this dream I find a dish underneath a chair. I take it out of the chair and notice there is a seed in it. I’m curious to see what the seed is so I give it some water. The seed expands. It happens very quickly. It expands into a baby. The baby stays a baby for perhaps a couple of days, whereas the seed grew into a baby in a couple of minutes. Over the course of the days that it’s a baby, I notice that it has a fondness for food that is different than people normally give babies. My relatives and in particular, my sister-in-law try to give the baby things they would have given to their own babies. I keep telling them, “No, he doesn't like that kind of food.” They’re not forcing him to eat food, they just keep offering him this regular baby food. He keeps refusing it. I put the baby into a bed that I’ve made and swaddle him with what I’ve got around to wrap him in. The next day he is a boy. It’s the same thing with the nourishment where my relatives and in particular my sister-in-law offer him what they think a boy should eat. He doesn’t eat it. But I’m giving him some different kind of food and I don’t know what it is. It’s not even really food. It’s not plants. It’s just something I intuitively know he would like, but the rest of my family is not noticing or not recognizing that it’s food. But it does nourish him and he grows really quickly. I put him to bed that night as a boy. Before he even goes to sleep, I watch him change into a man. I can clearly see his features. His face grows into something that is a bit angular in terms of jaw and chin and nose. He has brown hair, brown eyes, brown eyebrows. He’s quite tall and thin. Other than looking somewhat elfish of face, he doesn’t look strange. Anyone would think he is human and no one would know that he’s really grown out of a petri dish. So he’s no longer content to stay in the house. He leaves. He just goes out the door. There’s a regular day in my home. I’m not leaving the home. I’m making something out of fabric woven out of a really pretty navy silk that I’m weaving gold threads through. When I hang it up on the window, the navy part darkens the light so it doesn’t come through and pierce my eyes, but the gold picks it up, so it sparkles in the daylight without overwhelming. Then the man comes back at some point in a day. He sits. He doesn’t speak. He never speaks, but I intuitively know what to offer him. He seems content. I offer him to lie down in the bed. So he does, but he doesn’t sleep. He’s awake. I’m not really overly concerned with trying to communicate with him. The way he carries himself, he seems content. He never seems agitated, but he also never smiles. He’s lying in the bed, but he’s not sleeping. I can’t stay awake anymore, so I sleep. I feel at some point in the middle of the night that he’s hugging me. It feels nice. He just hugs me. When the light comes through the window covering that I’ve made - the one of navy and gold - I get up and so does he. He gets up and goes somewhere again through the day. I’m busy with some kind of activity in the house. I’m not alone in the house. There are a few other of my relatives there. This pattern continues for a number of nights. At one point I feel like we are lovers, but it’s not really acted out in the dream. It feels very natural and that’s really all there is - just a lifetime of staying with him.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

757,1378,,26/05/2020,05/26/2020 00:02,"“The Bathroom” I’m in a house this time. It’s a turn of the century home. It’s a fairly big brick house. Everything on the inside is made of wood - the floors, railings and banisters. There is wainscotting on the walls and crown molding. It has that lovely creaking sound everywhere where your feet walk. The house creaks. The doors creak. When you walk up and down the stairs, the stairs creak. It’s also built in a square. So, the stairs would go up one side of the house and down the other side, so that there can be a wood stove or something in the middle that heats the upper floor bedrooms at night when people are sleeping or even when the weather is cold. My room is on the second floor. One wall would be the windows looking to the outside, and opposite that would be the door that goes into the hallway. The hallway has a banister on one side that goes around in a square around the middle. So the hallway is actually quite a long tall domed ceiling and then the side that has the doors into everybody’s bedrooms. It feels like a square. There are at least two bedrooms on each side, so that makes it an eight bedroom house upstairs. It feels really, really big and I think it’s even bigger than that. There’s more than one bathroom. The fact that I have my own ensuite, my bedroom is also really big. This is my dream setting. I am in my bedroom and I’m aware that my daughter and her boyfriend have gone into my own ensuite bathroom because I can hear their voices. It sounds like one of them is in the shower and the other is just doing something in the bathroom. So they’re having a conversation. I realize it’s my daughter in the shower. She’s getting ready to go to work and her boyfriend is going to drive her. He’s doing most of the talking. I can hear sounds of her getting ready. As I look towards the bathroom, I see that there’s beading on the wall that my bedroom shares with the ensuite - the door to which is closed, obviously. I’m thinking, “Oh no, the shower water is leaking through the walls somehow.” Then I go around where the beading is. The part of the wall where the ensuite is is curved inwards towards my room. So I go around to the other side of the curve and I notice that the beading is getting more prolific and it’s brown, like tobacco color. Then my eyes follow up from the beading to the ceiling, and I see that the ceiling is buckled down a little bit. It’s a really high ceiling - probably about 12 feet high. I follow that all the way across the ceiling with my eyes towards the window. I can tell there are a whole bunch of watermarks, so this must have been going on for a really long time. Then when I look back to the curved part of my own wall, I can see that the beading has all turned black and it’s black mold. Then I turn back and look at the window. I see that that trajectory of water is also starting to turn into that tobacco color. Then I turn my head again and look back towards the shared wall of the bathroom and the material that the wall is made out of is starting to fall off the wall and around onto that one side to the left, there is a giant piece that has fallen off. I can see the shower curtain. It’s an old fashioned ball and claw bathtub with a track along the ceiling and the shower curtain. My daughter is like, “What’s that doing open when I’m having a shower?!” She’s shocked. Then both of them - she and her boyfriend - leave out the other door of the ensuite and enter my bedroom. She’s wrapped in a towel and asking what’s going on. I say, “I don’t know. The bathroom is falling apart. The mold is eating it.” Then we’re trying to figure out who to call and I realize I don’t know who owns the house. Then I have this book that’s a registry of ownership. I’m going backwards in a reverse chronology through time of who owned the house. I realize that all these people are dead. I communicate this to them and tell them I still haven’t figured out who to call. Now she’s dressed and getting ready to leave for work, but as I look up to the ceiling, some of the ceiling is starting to fall down. I’m telling them to go get buckets to put underneath the parts where most of the water seems to be channeling to and dripping. Then I’m thinking, “Who do I know that can come and help fix this? Who do I know that also has a house around this age that might have some wisdom?” I think of someone with last name Landon, who used to be the landlord of a house I lived in a long time ago. I find his phone number and call him. He arrives at the front door and one of the kids lets him in. He comes upstairs. He’s got a ladder and we put it in the room and climb up the ladder. As soon as I touch the ceiling, the whole thing buckles and comes down. I realize it’s a ceiling underneath a ceiling. Above the ceiling is an attic. There’s a secret staircase on the other side that I didn’t know was above me. The ceiling that I thought was my bedroom ceiling has crumbled and my room is completely unusable - it’s disintegrated. I’m climbing up the ladder trying to access the little staircase that has been exposed. Somehow I manage to do it. I reach for the bottom stair of the new staircase and climb up those creaky wooden stairs. There’s a wooden door at the top. I turn the doorknob and enter. It’s a really long attic. You can smell that musty sawdusty wood smell. But it smells dry - it’s not moist like the moldy smell of what has disintegrated below me. Then I see Omar. He’s sitting in there. He doesn’t say anything, though. I’m looking around the attic trying to locate or hunt for or unearth any signs of who has lived here before. I’m wondering why it was deliberately covered up. Unfortunately at this point, a noise in the real world wakes me up. I want to return to this dream.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I sneaked behind a row of houses, between the backs of the houses and a metal chain-link fence, and looked for evidence. I then met with three people who had schizophrenia and tried to get information from them. I entered one of their houses, where there was no restroom. I needed to pee, so I simply peed on the floor. They made fun of me for it, but there wasn't really any alternative. I had previously helped them unpack some groceries. I left with one of the schizophrenics where we discussed what was going on.

761,1379,,27/05/2020,05/27/2020 00:02,"“The Time Machine” This dream is in the house that I grew up in and it was also that same house where I was abused. There’s a really tangible emotion that is the backdrop of the dream. It feels like the house’s emptiness is really palpable. The physical setting of the furniture, the walls, everything has faded so that it’s almost colorless. This adds to the palpable feeling of emptiness. I’m doing something in my bedroom when the dream starts. I don’t know what it is. I slowly walk out the bedroom, down the hall towards the kitchen. The kitchen has more color in it than the other rooms. My first boyfriend, Daren, is sitting at the table. I haven’t seen him in a long time because he lives in England now. He has something in his hand. He opens his hand and I notice it’s a note. I leave it on the table. Then he gets up and I stand up. We both walk down the hall to my bedroom. We lie in the bed together. We embrace. I sit on top of him for a little while, then we embrace again. He lies on his side, then the phone rings and he says, “I have to take this.” He gets up and leaves the room and walks back down the hall. I know he’s in the kitchen, although I haven’t seen him in there. I wait for a little bit to give him some privacy with his phone call. It seems really quiet again. So I go back down to the kitchen. He’s gone. My biological mother is sitting there and she says, “He left you a gift.” I feel sad. I also feel like I don’t want to be alone with her. I’m starting to wonder how I’m going to get out of this house. She goes into the basement. I’m looking in the kitchen cupboards trying to find something I can make to eat and take with me. She comes back up the stairs. Because her presence is there, I’m no longer concerned with eating. At that moment in the dream, there’s a really strong emotion. It’s so strong that it wakes me up from that dream setting and puts me into a setting that’s an academic hospital. The emotion felt like I was afraid of a monster and frozen, but the monster didn’t appear and I knew it wouldn’t. I felt it physically move through my body. When I ended up in the hospital, I realize I’m an adult now. I’m also there as a student, which is very similar to the actual university I attended - it’s a training hospital for medical doctors. It just doesn't look like that university at all. I am walking through the campus which is also a hospital. I pass the cafeteria area and I see Daren sitting there with his friend Josh. I don’t have time to go talk to them at the moment. I need to get to class and I’m hoping they’ll still be there when I leave. I’m glad he still hasn’t returned to England and I’ll get another chance to talk to him. My classroom is filled with stretchers that have people on them. I’m confused because I can’t find my teacher or any of my classmates. I go from room to room and it’s just filled with people on stretchers. After a little bit of looking, I ask someone who looks like they’re in charge: “Do you know what happened to the classrooms?” She asks me if I can show her some ID. I do. As she scans it, she says, “Do you know this one is out of date?” I say, “Oh, no I didn’t.” She says, “Yes, you’ll need to go down to the office.” She tells me the number of the office and says, “You need to show someone that and get it fixed right away.” I think I’ll do that but I want to check and see if Daren is still sitting in the cafeteria. I can see he is. But there is another group of friends sitting at a table and they wave me over. They’re just saying hello and stuff and I haven’t seen you in so long and everything. One of them is Daren’s brother Carson. I also see my two other friends, Luke and Lynn. As soon as I see Luke and Lynn, the dream shifts and I’m on asphalt in a really old town. I’m part of a play. It’s like a movie set, but it’s not a movie set, it’s actually life. The reason I know time is moving in quickly, the letters on the buildings are being changed by a crew between each and every decade. The first decade, they called it Gothic. I’ve asked someone for the name of the font. Because some of the fonts are wider than others, the crew that paints the buildings use a spacer. It’s white and about 12 inches square - it’s a cube. They put this in between each word. It’s wide enough that if some of the letters take up more room due to their font, there is space between words so you can read them. The person that’s describing this tells me, “Yes, we used to have more, but some are out of date and they’ve been forgotten.” He told me the one we’re using now and it has a lot less curly stuff. The letters are sleaker and less wide. Now there’s a picnic table. We’re wearing time period of costume - about the turn of the 20th century. The clothes feel itchy and uncomfortable to me. Luke, Lynn and I are sitting at the picnic table and we’re waiting. It’s taking a long time for the painters to finish painting signs on the brick building and changing the font so people would know it’s a later year. The architecture is consistent with the turn of the century from 1800s to 1900s. There is the bustle of the railway being built and the architecture of the town looks like a railway town. It’s taking a long time and I realize that I do need to eat something. I see that there is a vendor with a machine that sells warm chestnuts. They’re a little bit off the road. So I get up to go over there. He doesn’t have food, though. He has sewing. I’m looking at the different sewing kits. One is to sew something that goes around your neck. The other is to sew something that I don’t even know what it is - I choose that one. I’m sitting on the ground. I open the kit, thread the needle and begin to sew. Luke comes up and tells me it’s time to go. I set the sewing down on the ground. Now we’re entering this vehicle. It’s going to take us out of this time and somewhere else. I don’t know where we’re going, but I think it’s ahead into the future. So we board the vehicle. It starts up. I can feel it’s got some kind of engine - it’s not very loud; it’s just vibrating more than anything. There are other people on it, too. Then I can see we’re higher than the ground. All of a sudden, the doors open and Luke grabs Lynn. Her back is toward his front. His hands are under her arms. He does a backbend and leaves the vehicle. He says,”We’re going out this way.” I watch them and am thinking, “Oh my god! They’re going to die!” They’re falling towards the ground. I stay in the time machine by myself.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

It has the feeling of Burning Man in that there are people normally dressed and others wildly dressed, some are drinking and others are sober, some are on stronger drugs. We have come up with a new drug that doesn’t have a name yet. It’s like a combination of Molly and something else. There is a very artistic creative guy dancing and frolicking around. He comes outside and he takes a piece of paper that he’s drawn and written on, and he posts it high on a tree. He’s tall and he can reach this high. Someone gets it down and reads the paper. They say, “Oh my gosh, this is the name of the drug. It’s Meggy. It’s a combination of Molly and Peggy.” The party dissipates a bit. I go home with my husband. We go upstairs. This is not a home I recognize from waking life. We decide to take our dose of Meggy. We know it takes a while to begin. We wander around. I get a book and start to read. I notice my vision starting to change - my right eye that in waking life is already damaged, starts to get really puffy and slotty so I can’t see well, and my other eye starts to change as well. I feel like it’s starting to set in. Someone comes and knocks on the door. We let him in and he says, “We’ve gotta go.” So we all get in the car. There are cars filling up with other people. I see a blue car that was earlier in the day quite nice, but now it’s beat up a bit and covered in mud. We’re all trying really hard to get out fast, so something is going on. We arrive at a rundown hotel. One of the girls steps in and she’s trying to talk to the concierge. I’m watching her from a different perspective - as if from behind the concierge’s head. I’m looking her up and down. She’s dressed as a very prim and proper lady, all in white with white pumps. But she has dark black circles under her eyes and she’s really pale. She doesn’t look quite right. All of us have taken Meggy. Then there is violence. The woman transforms into a wild animal and kills him. The guy in charge of the whole operation has turned into a grizzly bear. I turn into a wild cat. Everyone is turning into wild predators. There’s a graphic scene in the elevator where I bat somebody’s head off. There’s guts and brain matter everywhere. All the animals congregate because we have to get together and get out. We all transform into somewhat human form and get out. A lot of time passes. I’ve separated out from the group and am trying to live a normal human life. I’m driving in my car down a country road. I end up at a farm. I see the guy who was in charge. Something has shifted in him and there is peace in him. He welcomes me. He takes me on a tour of the farm and introduces me to the people who live there. It’s an orphanage. There are some people who were originally part of the Meggy group. The effects of the drug have changed. Now they use it only occasionally to spark creativity or connection to each other and the Earth. They’ve created a completely self-sustainable farm, growing vegetables and fruit, milking goats and cows, raising chickens...they have found a way to make peace with themselves and the Earth.

There are other classmates with me, but I’m not sure which ones. They’re all getting ready for a party and I’m trying to get ready with them. The house we’re in is dark. There was a felt sense of unease. My brother shows up, too. We are fighting and arguing. I’m not sure what we’re fighting about, but there’s definitely discord. All I can remember of this part of the dream is that I’m trying to get ready. They’re all ready to go and are leaving. I’m trying to find shoes to put on. I’m trying to find an entire outfit - I don’t know what to wear and don’t have anything that feels good. Part of it is my resistance to going to this party. It’s making it hard for me to decide on an outfit and shoes. A coworker of mine is here, too - he’s my date to this party. Of all the other characters, he’s the only one I feel comfortable with. He’s encouraging me in a sweet way to get dressed and get in the car with him. I do. There’s a party of the dream where I’m in the car with him and we are going somewhere. That feels nice and my body feels calm in that place. But there’s so much agitation beforehand when I’m trying to get dressed, and there is bickering between me and my friends and me and my brother. My coworker is trying to smooth everything out, help me get ready and take me to the party. I go from being in the house in the living room area with friends to being in his Jeep or truck. I have feelings of gratitude and safety while I'm in the car with him. Then the scene changes. I am outdoors near the ocean. There’s a covered pavilion area and a bunch of people dancing hula. It’s so lovely to watch them dancing. It’s a bunch of different haul halaus dancing, so they each have their own style and their own songs. It’s not super formal because there isn’t a stage. I’m standing watching them to my right and behind me. They have their leis and everything. The musicians are somewhere and I can hear them playing the music, but I can’t see them. Then my hula sister Deborah shows up with her dad and her mom and my hula brother, Uncle Kam who is also my alaka’i (leader) in the hula halau. We all look at each other and wonder why we aren’t dancing because we know how to dance and we have dances to share. So, we try to put on our music. Deborah’s dad starts to play - he’s our musician - but it’s so quiet that it’s hard to hear him over the crowd noise of all the other dancers. There’s this feeling of being misfits and not allowed or accepted. We are all trying to dance, but since we can’t hear the music, our movements are all a little bit off. The other dancers are looking at us like, “What are you guys doing? You’re not good.” But we are just unable to hear the music fully. That part of the dream fades away.

767,1380,,28/05/2020,05/28/2020 00:04,"“The Fun House” We are at a carnival. It’s an outdoor carnival and there are a lot of hay bales and it has a rural country feel to it. Things are made of wood - plywood - and painted. I’m there with my daughter. In order to participate in the carnival, we are required when we enter to put on some kind of costume. I feel in my being that I don’t really want to because I know they aren’t washed in between wearers. I feel that they have the potential of having bugs in them. This has partially due to the fact that they’re sitting on bales of hay. But this is something she’s really been looking forward to. So I hesitantly and gingerly put on my costume which is some kind of navy blue skirt, navy blue overcoat that’s belted, and a hat. There are shoes that go with it, but they hurt my feet. So I’ve taken off the shoes and am carrying them. It has a little of the 1930s to the design of the clothing. She dawns her, as well. They’re very large for her - the sleeves are too long. She’s a young girl. I roll up the sleeves and adjust her hat so it’s not flopping over her eyes. We go through the first pseudo-activity. We’re climbing over hay bales. The thing moves us upwards. At the top of it, there’s a door. It brings us into something we’re going to see as opposed to experience or climb. We’re waiting in line to go in and the attendant asks me why I don’t have the shoes on because I’m supposed to be wearing them. I explain that they hurt my feet - they’re too small and they pinch my toes. She gives me a dirty look, but doesn’t make me put the shoes on. I’m also offended by some kind of connotation that the costumes represent either a religion or an ethnicity. So because she’s glaring at me, I also retort, “Would I have to wear the same costume if I was pretending to be Christian.” I think I said Christian, but I can’t really remember. Her response to that is a different kind of look. She stopped glaring at me and looks a little taken aback. But she’s moved back and I think, “Well, that’s good. Maybe she won’t bother me anymore.” On the other hand, my daughter has already gone through and I follow her. She has to crawl underneath a piece of plywood. It’s like there’s a window, but it’s close to the ground - it’s a crawlspace. She’s crawled through and is standing on some kind of manmade theatre balcony. She’s looking at something on the other side. I don’t feel like crawling there. I can see that she’s jumping up and down. She’s excited about what she sees, so I’m content to sit on the other side and wait until she’s done. She finishes in a few minutes and comes out. We go back down the hay bale we had to climb to get there and out the other side. Now I see a low to the ground platform. It seems to be built out of plywood. There are people standing there waiting to enter into a performance area. I see by the sign that it’s someone I know. Her name is Trisha and she’s a kundalini yoga teacher. Trisha and another person are performing in there. We stand at the outside of the door. It’s dark. We don’t enter. I can only hear that there is some kind of chanting going on, but it’s dissonant. It’s really unpleasant. I think, “Oh, that’s strange because Trisha has a lovely voice.” So we keep going. Now I see other people in time period costumes. The men are wearing some kind of dark suit with a white shirt. I see this one man has bugs crawling up the back of his neck and over his skull. I tell him this. He kind of takes his hand to the back of his head and brushes them off, but it’s not adequate to rid his body of all of them. I tell him he’s still got some more there. My daughter and I keep on walking. I see someone else I know - Amy. She’s a naturopath. She’s there with Trisha. i wonder what they’re doing because the carnival doesn’t seem like their thing. I’m starting to see animals randomly walking through the crowd - a koala bear, a monkey, a porcupine, a pig, a rhinoceros, a hippopotamus, and some flying creatures. A lot more insects are arriving around us. At this point, I really want to leave. I tell my daughter that I think it would be best if we go. She actually agrees and says, “Yes, let’s go.” Instead of staying on the ground, we’re suddenly transported upwards a little. I’d say we’re about 4 feet above the heads of everyone else. The animals are getting more prolific. They’re starting to run. A few of them are starting to run and charge other people. Other people are starting to run. I can see the man who had the bugs crawling up his neck and I can see from the top that they’re ants and they’re almost entirely covering his bodies - there are thousands. He’s starting to spin around in circles and flap his arms in futility, trying to get them off. Whatever it is that we’re flying on narrowly misses the porcupine who has put himself in charge position. I can tell he’s about to release his needles and we just barely miss that. Even the koala who I didn’t realize was dangerous is starting to run and charge people. People are desperately trying to get out of the way.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

Somehow nothing that happened really stuck though, so even if we died we would be fine. We all entered a giant tent at the start of the round where we looked for weapons. Most of the weapons were letter-opener swords. I grabbed one and went on the offensive. I found Erica and tricked her so that I could stab her. I saw the red blood pouring out where I had inflicted the wound. I did the same to Doug. I managed to win the first two rounds, but needed to win the third in order to secure complete victory.  In the third round, I failed to find a weapon and only was able to find a walking sticks to use as make-shift weapons. Instead of hunting down other players, I went to the main temple area and persuaded an official to help me. Once we got inside of the temple, I realized that the final round was a cook off and I had to prepare a meal for the judges. The meal was spaghetti, but we had to make it with three different kinds of sauces. I had one red sauce and a white sauce, but I needed a second red sauce which I didn't have. I used some plain alfredo sauce in the hopes that the judges wouldn't notice.  But then we realized that this wasn't the real challenge! The real challenge was to steal 200 gold pieces worth of items from the temple. As we were searching for items, a team of thieves showed up and were going to try to steal from us. But we were one step ahead. I made a plan with my brother to give them a tour of the temple while Doug would stay behind and steal their wallets.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

772,1171,,29/05/2020,05/29/2020 00:03,"This reminds me of the matrix. We are underground. I’m with a bunch of people, but don’t recognize any of them. There is mischief afoot. We are traveling and making a break for freedom. We are leaving booby traps behind us as we go. I think we are traveling down a set of tracks for an underground tram. We’re passing by rooms with two-way mirrors. We can see people in the rooms. I don’t know where we’re heading, except that we’re trying to get out of where we are. It’s dark. If there is any lightning, it’s fluorescent bulbs. These booby traps we’re leaving are made of whatever we can find and use our ingenuity to turn them into something. I don’t even know what they all do. We’re on the move. We’re all kind of dirty and grungy. It’s not that we’re running away, but rather making a break for freedom. There’s not a lot of fear, just that we need to get this, this and this done, so we can get out of here. Then the dream shifts into me and a pole instructor from the pole studio. I’ve been practicing pole moves that she’s given me at home, but something happens and I’m unable to practice for a while. I go to one of her classes. I’m watching. She’s standing in the middle with a pole and there are twelve poles around her on the outside. The poles are really wide - I can’t wrap my hands around them. Instead of being a solid pole, there are metal handles that stick out on the side and you’re supposed to grab onto these handles to do the moves. After taking a hiatus, I’m watching. The pole instructor is calling out moves and everyone does them together perfectly synchronized. All of these women in their pole clothes are doing this move called the butterfly. They’re all doing it together. I walk in and she tells me to do this because she knows I can do it. I haven’t touched a pole in weeks and don’t know if I have the strength. She gives me her center pole because all the other poles are taken. I get up and do the move, but it’s a struggle. I can tell my legs are bent when they need to be straight and I have to push really hard to get out and up into the butterfly move. It’s a move where you push away from the pole and your body is upside down with the only contact at the pole being one foot and your hands. Because the poles are huge, I’m holding onto the handle to push out. I’m super disappointed because it’s so hard for me to do these moves because I’ve taken so much time off. I don’t know why I took so much time off, I just know I haven’t been able to do what I’d like to do. I keep thinking I’m not strong as everyone else and it bums me out that I seem to have this uphill struggle and I’ve lost ground in my training and will have to work really hard to get it back.

You had to have personal invitations to some of the more exclusive parties. People were also going out of the hotel to other parties that required invitations and secret directions. It’s really crowded and not entertaining. I mostly just wander from party to party and room to room, feeling a bit awkward as people do at parties. I decide to go home at the end of the night. Before I leave, I see some chalk drawing on the ground and people are on their knees drawing. I wake the next morning and start baking. There are cupcakes and a couple cakes in the oven. I’m making a big round loaf of puffy poppyseed bread. Someone comes and knocks on the door urgently telling me that I have to come right now. So there are only 7 minutes left on the timer, but I have to go. I tell my dad the instructions really quickly. As I’m pulling on my shoes and coat, I realize I am starving and haven’t had any breakfast. I pull the bread out and tear off a piece, but this deflates the bread. It won’t be very good now and it’s still a bit wet and gooey on the inside. I put it back in the oven and tell my dad to take everything out in 5 minutes. I run off and follow my friend. We are running past houses and it’s really early, still dark. We run towards the harbor. I see a huge bird flying, but it looks more like a crawfish or koi fish with black feathers.

777,1172,,30/05/2020,05/30/2020 00:04,"The dream starts with me in a car driving through rolling hills with big houses in the distance. It reminds me of a gated community. There’s lots of land. The parcels are huge and the houses are huge and there’s a lot of space between all of them. The hills are green and rolling. There’s a community center that we’re heading to. I get to this community center and home owners are coming and going. There are tables and chairs in one area and tv’s on the wall. Another area is like a nurse’s office. People are having their temperatures taken and getting shots. I think maybe they’re quarantining for coronavirus or giving vaccines. I’m not sure, but something like that is happening. I’m here. I get dropped off in this community center or clubhouse that the HOA owns. I’m watching people come and go - mostly white men. My ex father in law and ex show up. We have some interactions. I think I owe him some money and he wants the money from me. I don’t think I have everything I owe him, but I give him some. I’m reminding him we’re on a payment schedule and he’ll just have to wait for the rest. This part of the dream feels uncomfortable. I’m really not excited to see him or my ex. I don’t know what my ex wants. He’s just kind of there lurking. I’m really wanting to get away from both of them. They leave with some sort of promise from me that I’ll continue making my payments. I’m going from table to table in the clubhouse. I’m bored. I don’t know why I’m waiting or why I’m still there. For some reason I have to stay because I’m in quarantine of some sorts. There’s a nurse that comes in and gets me. I go into her office. I’m sitting on one of those benches with the paper on it. She’s taking my temperature and drawing my blood. She’s very friendly and I actually feel comfortable with her. While I’m in there, some of the wives of the owners of these houses come in and they’re all very chatty Kathy’s and dripping in jewelry and expensive stuff. I’m not. I’m wearing shorts and a tank top and slippers. Either the nurse or someone else who runs the clubhouse sees that I don’t look like the rest of them. She finds these strands, maybe 20 or 30 glass beads of all different colors. It’s a gorgeous necklace. She puts in on me and says, “Normally you’d have to pay for this, but I'm giving this to you. Don’t tell anybody I did.” It’s something she got from the gift shop part of the clubhouse. It’s this gorgeous necklace. She wraps it around twice and it looks beautiful on me. As soon as she does that, I'm suddenly no longer this misfit in the clubhouse, I’m queen. The energy changes. The other housewives, instead of just tolerating my presence, actually really begin to leave me alone in recognition of how much power I have. I get up and leave the nurse’s office and the clubhouse. I think I don’t need to be here. I go outside and there’s these huge trees - they look like oaks. There’s a storm, maybe a hurricane coming. Some of the husbands are trying to fortify the trees by raking the ground and moving the roots - trying to spread them wider so the trees will make it through this high wind. I’m watching them do this. Every time they try to move a limb or root to put it in the ground, I’m like, “Don’t touch the trees. You can’t change how they’re going to plant themselves or be.” I keep watching this one husband raking the ground. I see him take a fallen branch and try to plant it in the ground. It’s got all this green moss over the top of it. I see him plant it then turn around and move away. I watch as the tree just picks it up and moves it to where it wants it to be. These trees keep doing that. They keep moving their limbs to where they want them to be. I keep shaking my head at these men who think they’re going to be able to direct where the trees grow.",Rose,last_nights_dream
778,1381,,30/05/2020,05/30/2020 00:05,"“The Airport” We are trying to get away to go on a vacation. I’m carpooling with two of my friends, Sadie and Brian. I’ve got my son with me, too. My son and I arrive at Sadie and Brian’s house and we’re supposed to be leaving from there to go to the airport, but we’ve got some time. Sadie is making food and putting it in takeout containers so we can eat in the car on the way to the airport. There are about 4 hours until we have to leave, though. My daughter enters the dream and sets the alarm clocks and then is gone again. My son decides to sleep. I decide it’s best to stay up, but I want to have a bath, so I do. I use the bathtub and take a long soak with bubbles and everything. When I come out, Sadie is still cutting up things and putting them in takeout containers. She’s made one for my son and I, as well. I think this is really nice of her; however, I wasn’t hungry and it’s the middle of the night. I was just going to wait and eat on the plane. Now I wish I had some fruit. What she’s putting in there is leftover cooked potatoes - she is slicing them up and then grabbing pieces of processed cheese - like the singles you would take the plastic off. She has a whole stack of these and she puts in the microwave. The four on the top and bottom melt and become liquified. I notice she’s done this in a bowl before she’s unwrapped them. She used them all and put them on her husband’sI try to pick off the rim of cheese left on the bowl, but it’s like glue. Some of it’s hard and some is still soft. It’s the texture of the glue when you get a credit card in the mail and you take the card off the letter it came on and you have to roll that sticky stuff up between your fingers. I point this out and show her how it turns into glue in your body and how some of it has already hardened onto the bowl. I tell her as nicely as possible that I don’t want it on my potatoes. Although she says, “eww,” when I’m scraping this stuff off the inside of the bowl and rolling it around like a glue ball, she still puts it on her potatoes. She’s looking for other things to put on it, too. Now it seems like this has been going on a really long time - it seems like more than four hours have passed. I ask her, “What time did the tickets say we’re supposed to be there?” She says, “5 o’clock in the morning.” But she says it in metric first, but we don’t use metric, we use the 12 hour clock. I say, “Are you sure you counted that right? You have to add on the four hours after the 12 o’clock.” So we both do this in the kitchen. Brian, her husband, is in the kitchen, too, and we all agree that 5 o’clock is the time we were supposed to leave. So I go to get my son because it’s almost that time. He’s already up because the alarm has gone off. So he’s getting his clothes on and I’m putting things into the suitcase. We’re well prepared. We didn't unpack. Then Sadie asks me if we unpacked. I say, “Nope, we only had this little corner of stuff and all we needed to take out was this.” Then I realize I don’t have my son or my passports. I say this with a note of alarm in my voice, “Oh no! I forgot our passports. I actually have enough time if I leave right now. It only takes a half hour. I’ll quickly drive to my house and come back up. It will be fine. We’ll still be there in lots of time.” Her husband says no, I don’t want you to do that. Besides, we’re just going into the US and you don’t need passports anymore.” But I tell them, “Every time we go in, I have my passport! What if they need it this time? I think the rules have changed.” He gets out a piece of paper that’s attached to the back of his driver’s license. He says, “Here, read the fine print.” I read down and it says it’s fine to go on with just a driver’s license or a choice of two other things. I do have my driver’s license with me. I say, “But my son doesn’t have his ID. His last name is different than mine and they always question me on that.” He’s trying to convince me it will be fine. I say, “Well now 5 minutes have passed and there are only 25 minutes left. I really want to go back down and get our passports.” But he won’t let us go. He tells us all it’s time to get into the car and leave. So we do. They’re eating their takeout containers of potatoes with cheese. I don’t eat mine. My son is hungry and wants to eat, but I push the cheese to the side so he doesn’t ingest it. We arrive at the airport. Brian parks the car. We’re inside, but we get separated. I feel really anxious because I have no one to vouch for who we are and we don’t have passports. The airport is circular and almost feels like the Los Angeles airport in its size and layout. I’m walking around and around looking for the gate. I don’t have my tickets. I think they have the tickets. Then I see someone else I know - Alice. I ask her if she’s seen Sadie and Brian. She says, “Yes, they’re over at Gate such and such.” So I thank her and we continue. When I get there, they’ve already gone through the gate and are on the plane. I talk to the security guard. He agrees and allows us to go on the plane. I think that’s great, although I’m not completely 100% relieved because we still have to come back without passports. I don’t see Sadie and Brian on the plane. The plane lands in Florida. We disembark. I see them up ahead. The rest of the dream is uneventful. We find our bus that takes us to a hotel. We get off there and just change into our bathing suits, enjoy the sun and warmth, and swim.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

782,1173,,31/05/2020,05/31/2020 00:03,"It starts with me riding in a car with my lover. He starts out very attentive, as he should be, then he gets high and checks out. I’m not so stoked about it because we are headed to the pole studio where I’m going to practice. I’m not sure if he was going to work out or practice. It is a pole studio/gym so there is a place for him to go workout. It’s important that he works out and trains because there’s something he’s training for. I am training, too. We get to the pole studio. Unlike the pole studio I practice at, which is light and bright, this studio is pretty dark. The poles are so tall that the tops disappear into darkness. It’s almost like the studio is as big as an amphitheatre. I have a nagging feeling. There are other people training, I don’t know who they are, but they’re all women. We get there and I realize this pole studio and workout facility is owned by Wendy. Wendy is a woman I had a crazy emotionally abusive relationship with and she is now an ex-friend of mine. Going to a place she owns is filling me with dread. The reason we were heading that way is because of quarantine, so she wasn’t there. She was also pregnant and out of the picture, so it was safe for me to go there. Now she’s no longer pregnant and quarantine is over and she shows up and starts being a total tyrant. She hasn’t seen me though, so I hide. I lay on the ground and the other women - some are younger, maybe 12 or so - all sit on top of me and do a dance. They’re like the goddess with lots of arms. They do one of those dances where each arm goes in succession. They’re sitting on me so you can’t see my body at all - I’m covered and hidden. Somehow Wendy sees me anyway. She makes them stand up and get off me so she can see me. She just starts yelling at me - “Get on the pole! Do the moves!” I can’t. I’m tired and I haven’t done pole in a long time, so I don’t have the strength I usually have. This is really hard and I’m feeling attacked without resources to defend myself, just out of my own fatigue and because my nervous system is shocked from being in her presence. She is a tyrant. She’s wearing a ballet bodysuit with one of those ballet skirts that go straight out. It looks funny on her because her body is very beefy. She’s barking orders at everyone. I feel so attacked and I really want to get out of there, but I can’t find my lover. He actually shows up, but he kind of fawns to her. She intimidates him, as well. The whole situation feels gross. One part of me is going, “Oh my god, you’re not actually a victim, you could get out of this at any time.” But in the dream I’m being taken through this tyrant-victim dynamic and my lover is not defending himself because he’s high and he’s also not defending me. I’m upset about it. Then we have a dream shift. There’s a battlefield. I’m observing and not partaking in this part of the dream. Soldiers are coming in off the ocean. We’re on a beach. The ones coming in off the ocean have more primitive weapons, like lances. The soldiers maintaining the beach have guns and bombs. It’s a fucking slaughter. The ocean is red from blood. There are bodies floating everywhere and bodies on the sand. I know that the soldiers on the beach are Japanese. They come from the samurai background but are not using their samurai honor at all. Then as I’m observing, I pull back from the beach and am in a bunker. It has one window that I can see out of. There are a bunch of men - generals I think - sitting around a table and looking at a map. I’m not participating - I’m observing all of this. I look to my right and there is one window where you can see and hear the ocean. As I’m looking, a gigantic sneaker wave is coming right towards this bunker and is going to come right through this window. I think, “Why would you build a bunker so close to the ocean. You have to know there are tides and the water can get you at any point. This is way too close to the water.” I just watch as this huge wave comes and covers the bunker. The bunker is concrete, so it’s not going anywhere, but the water that comes in the window is going to get everyone. The water gets up to the window, then the dream shifts. So I don’t actually see the water come into the bunker. I don’t see what happens to the rest of the fighting. The last impression I have is a lot of dead bodies. And it’s all men. The dream shifts and I’m on a school campus. I cross a bridge and go from the dorms which are in a forest. The forest is beautiful and the trees are not really big around. They are smaller and remind me of young eucalyptus trees. The bark is that creamy pale mixed with red. There is a lot of space, paths, fairy lights and lightning bugs. It’s pretty magical As soon as I cross the bridge everything changes and I can tell I’m in an academic setting. In front of me are buildings. People - professors and other college students - are coming at me. They’re hurrying here and there. To my right there is a stream or creek - it’s not a river. It’s this gorgeously stepped hillside that goes down. It’s not man made steps, just natural levels that go down. It’s emerald green - grass, moss and tiny moss flowers. The roots from trees make each level. I’m walking down towards the stream because I’m having an aversion to going to school or towards the college. I can actually see myself squatting next to the stream. I have a backpack on, but I really don’t want to go to school. I do meet with someone. There is a conversation, but I don’t remember what it is. I can see myself squatting down next to the water. This piece feels magical, like a continuation of the forest. There is a line where you can see you step into academia where it is grey and the energy is grey. I just don’t head that direction even though I need to - there is stuff I need to do and papers I need to write. Then the dream shifts again. I’m in a garden, the kind with well trimmed hedges that make a kind of labyrinth. I’m meeting this older woman with grey hair. She reminds me of Glenn Close when she played Cruella De Vil in “101 Dalmations” or in the movie, “The Devil Wears Prada.” She’s totally a bitch and stalking around. I don’t think I’m her apprentice, but there’s some sort of power dynamic where I’m supposed to be doing things for her. I keep doing them wrong and I’m not wearing the right clothes. I get three tries. We meet together three different times. Each time I’m wearing a different outfit and I’ve brought something for her from a task I was supposed to complete. I don't remember what they were. What I do remember is that each time she sees my clothes, she’s so disappointed that I haven’t dressed the part and I don't look like her assistant or her apprentice. She says I look sloppy. She’s super verbally abusive the first two times. On the third time, I pop out and it’s not me as her apprentice. It’s someone else and I’m observing. This time I watch as she’s super physically violent with the woman who is her apprentice. She pushes her through a scratchy thorny hedge and then pushes her down into the water. The woman’s clothing is actually really lovely. She has white satin slingback high heels on and a nice coat and gloves. Each time she has met, the clothing has changed. This time, the Glenn Close character holds her down under the water and ruins the shoes and coat. I can tell there was no way this woman or me was ever going to do it right and this other woman is just crazy abusive. Then the dream switches again. I make music - I’m a music artist. I’ve made a song and it’s gone to be judged and given an award. I can clearly see recording equipment in front of me. I’m sitting on a couch and singing. As I sing, I splice in somebody else who is rapping, then I go back to singing. It’s very formulaic - a lot of songs on the radio sound like this. I am hearing the song in my head and don’t think it’s really special. It is very formulaic - just like what every producer puts out these days with collaborations between famous people, but don’t really mean a whole lot. The words aren’t really inspiring and neither is the melody or tune or anything. But I put it out and somehow I get an award for this piece. I’m sitting on this couch and the people who bring me the award are two young Japanese men who are apprenticed to a master. They are maybe in their twenties. I can see the master in the background, but the two that come, are men. They come one at a time. They are holding these gold statues of a record player. Their feet are shuffling as they approach me. They have it held out in front of them, then they bow and hand it to me. Someone is announcing in the background that I’ve won these awards. But I’m still on this couch where I can see through the walls and see the outside. I can actually see the doorframe that these Japanese men are walking through, but there are no walls on either side and the door frame itself is translucent - I can see through it. I can also see through the doorway because I can see them coming. So the first one comes and hands me the award and bows and leaves. Then the MC makes another announcement to say I’ve won another award. The second Japanese man comes shuffling towards me and bows with a lot of humility. So now I have these two awards. Then this other woman shows up. She looks like Lana del Ray, but a really young version of her. She goes, “I don't know why you won. Your song is not that good.” She plays me her song that was in the same category as mine. Her song is beautiful and her voice is beautiful - it’s haunting. However, it has the same formula. She sings, then somebody raps, then she sings and somebody raps. I’m going like, “Yeah, why did my song win? Her song is way more beautiful than mine.” She goes, “I think you copied me. You just stole it.” I was like, “Well, no, I definitely did not steal it. Mine is not even close to as good as yours.” It just feels like a strange thing. Those awards I won feel right. I did earn the awards according to the criteria. I did feel a sense of accomplishment. But when I compare it to what she’s created, I’m like, “Whoa, you definitely deserve awards for what you’re doing. I don’t understand why you didn’t get any.” So she comes at me with some competitive energy, but I am not feeling the competition. I agree with her. I think she should have won some awards.",Rose,last_nights_dream
783,1382,,31/05/2020,05/31/2020 00:04,"“The Waterfall” I’m getting ready to go for a hike with my friend. We are just meeting at a house, I think it’s mine, but it’s a house I’ve never lived in in real life. My kids are still asleep in it. Then the dream backtracks - it’s like it freezes there - to the night before. I was in my room with my son and my daughter. We were playing some kind of game. The tools for it looked like markers, but they were actually magnetic. When you applied them to the board, which looked like a whiteboard, they left a colored line even though they were magnets and not markers filled with any kind of liquid color. They were not felt-tipped. The tips were really hard. As we were playing with them, it wasn’t just a free flow creative “let’s draw this.” There was some kind of instruction that went with the game. It was working out fine. We had to do an algebra or conning - which is how you navigate a boat using the chart of the water. So we were following the instructions, doing the equations, then putting dots on the whiteboard with these magnetic markers. I guess it was taking a long time because the magnetic pens started to disintegrate, but my kids kept playing the game - they kept doing the calculations. I was trying to fix the magnetic pens - the lids had popped off of some of them and were in the bottom of the container. Then it started getting more complicated. So instead of being a set of ten and they all looked like they were different colors, it was like there were three sets. They were all different shapes and the lids were all different sizes. One of the lids looked like it fit on one purple pen, but it didn’t, it actually fit on the other purple one. They wouldn’t leave the dots on the board unless the lids and the ends were on properly. And then the wires that were part of the internal workings started coming out of the ends and I was trying to reassemble them. This tired my children after a while and they both went to sleep. My son was sleeping on the floor in my bedroom and my daughter was in a bed in her room. The night passed and I didn’t sleep, but my kids did. Then it was time for my hike. My friend was downstairs waiting for me. My son got up. He was just roaming around the house doing his own thing and making some food. My daughter was still sleeping. I wanted to leave her a note. I found one piece of paper that was all blacked out except for a small white square. I wrote on it with a pencil that I was going for a hike and then “xoxo” Love mom. I put it on her bed and then I realized that she found a box of old pictures and had stayed up quite late looking at them. She had a pile of her favorites. They were old family pictures that went beyond back to her family before she was born. I remember gently putting my hand on her hip and wiggling her a little bit to wake her up. She was kind of grumpy and when she realized she didn’t have to get up and I was just saying goodbye before going for my hike, she smiled and said, “Look at all the pictures.” I said, “Yeah, that’s really nice.” They were taken care of. My friend and I changed, making sure we weren’t wearing anything bright. We were wearing some kind of green clothes to go on the hike so we wouldn’t stand out. We drove to the place we were hiking. It was a short drive away. The last thing I remember is we hiked quite a bit and it was an older forest. It reminds me of the forests in British Columbia. The trees are huge giant redwoods. We came to a waterfall and it was skinny and long and tall and it extended up into the sky, farther than my eyes could see. I just remember standing there feeling how big it was - how beautiful and how primal.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

We were ordering pizza, but after we had done so, Uncle P. and I went to go find the hot tubs which were in the pizza place. We found one which was about 4 feet wide and 20 feet long and pill-shaped. The water was not particularly clean or warm. We realized that we had to turn on the heat before we got in. Or maybe it was that after you got in, it would sense your presence and heat up. We found a smaller circular and metal hot tub and decided that that was the one which we would use. We got into it, but for some reason I decided to wash my hands with soap which filled the entire tub with bubbles. I felt stupid for having done this, but it ended up not being a big deal. We looked for a waitress to place our order so that we could dine while sitting in the hot tub. It turned out that doing this was significantly more expensive. I remember the total being in excess of $70. We briefly though about ways in which we might game the system to get a cheaper pizza.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

791,1174,,02/06/2020,06/02/2020 00:03,"The first part of this dream is definitely collective-related. I’m in a car. There’s a car in front of me that I can see, it’s a Subaru. We are driving through snow. The snow is as tall as the car. I can see the car in front of us is having to make its own path through the snow. It’s interesting it’s making it because the snow is literally up to the top of the car. We are on our way to a shelter. We’re on an adventure. I’m not exactly sure who I’m with. We’re heading towards a hotel - it reminds me of an ice hotel in northern Europe. We make it there. There are multiple rooms, but it doesn’t actually look like a hotel. It looks like a huge cave and within the cave are rooms you can claim as yours. There were at least two people in the car in front of me and there are people in the car with me - I don’t know who or how many. We head into the hotel and get our rooms. The rooms are packed snow - the bed is snow shaped into a bed as you would shape a snowman. When you go out of the room and down the hall, there’s a huge crack in the ceiling where you can see blue sky. But when you look up, you can also see a cliff face that looks like the side of a mountain. The back part of the hotel is this huge cliff face. Something happens and I don’t know if somebody yells or a gunshot goes off or what, but there’s a moment with a really loud noise. As soon as that happens, I say, “Oh fuck!” I know that whatever that was, it’s a moment in a time when something acts as a catalyst and as soon as it happens, I can see an avalanche at the top of the cliff. The snow just starts coming down. There’s no fucking way any of us are getting out of the path. This hotel is full of people, including kids. I just know that we are all going to be buried by this avalanche. I had this hope in my heart that it stops or goes around us or somehow we get out in time. Now I’m booking it out the other way as fast as I can to get away from this avalanche. If I can just get in the car and get out and drive away as fast as I can get out. Then the dream shifts from this place to a gym facility with multiple rooms for exercise, but also big pools. I’m with my daughter and she’s little, maybe 4, 5 or 6. There are also a lot of other young girls, teenagers. They’re on a team of some sort visiting the pool together. My daughter and I are in the locker room. We head out to the pool area. I have my wallet and phone on me. My wallet is one I had when I was a teenager - a black leather Volcrum brand. It was a men’s wallet, but I liked it because it fit into the grunge aesthetic. I put the wallet down with the phone on top, and my keys, too. It’s just this random bench on the side of the pool. There’s a huge slide, at least 10 or 12 stories high and you have to climb up stairs to get there. My daughter is running ahead of me and I’m chasing her. I don’t want her to go down this slide - it’s too tall and too dangerous. But as I am going up these steps, I can feel my heart is fucking racing. I’m looking down and I can see the surrounding city. There’s smog and the buildings are tiny. We’re up so high. I’m starting to panic. We never get to the top of the slide because all of a sudden, the stairs start to go down. My daughter is going down and I’m feeling relieved that she’s going down the stairs. I’m coming down the stairs and am like, “Oh sweet baby Jesus, thank you!” I do not like heights. There are all these landings, at about every ten stairs. My mom is at one of the landings and she has a bowl of rice and poke. I’m starving and freaked out from being so high. I’ve also been worried about my daughter, who I can see has now made it all the way back down the stairs and is running around at the edge of the pool below me. I’m thinking that she’s safer down there and it’s okay. I can still see my wallet, keys and phone. I don’t know why anyone isn’t stealing them because they’re just sitting by themselves on this bench. And my daughter is also down there and she’s okay. There are some other people on this landing with me and my mom. It’s like my mom has come to me and the other people are my people - they are strangers, but I don’t feel threatened by them. But with my mom, I’m feeling a bit edgy. So she has this bowl of rice and poke and she sets it down. It’s the most perfectly made. There’s also seared ahi and just barely seared steak in this bowl, too. She sets it down between us and I go to eat some of it, but I knock it over. A bunch of it falls onto the stairs. These stairs are metal. I just pick it up and put it back in the bowl because I’m not going to waste it. I know there have been tons of people with their bare feet and chlorine and pool water coming up these stairs, but i just put it all back in the bowl because I’m going to eat it anyway. It’s like an offering she’s made towards me and I’m hungry enough I’m going to eat and I’m freaked out enough that I need something to really ground me and bring me back into my body and shift out of this panic state. This panic state went through both of these dreams. The dream shifts. Now I’m watching a tictoc video of a young local Hawaiian woman. She has her hair in a bun. She’s hanging out with her friends. She does a forward roll and the bun comes undone, so as it loosens the bun gets bigger. As her bun comes undone, her friends are teasing her saying, “Oh it looks so funny!” She’s like “Oh no!” and tightens the bun back up on her head. There was almost a bit of shame with her hair coming undone because her hair needing to stay up. They were poking fun at her but it wasn’t shaming and humiliating fun. But she was concerned about her hair coming out of this bun. This was a video that I was watching.",Rose,last_nights_dream

I’ve seen him before and I’ve seen him as my bodyworker or chiropractor in the dream. He’s a genius. He lives by himself but works out of his home. I show up at his home and go back towards his office. I don’t even make an appointment, I just show up. I am wearing a long green skirt and white top. I take off my top and turn around so he can look at my back. He doesn’t adjust it like I think he will. He presses a specific point or two like acupressure. He says, “That’s all you need. That will fix everything.” I’m like, “Mm I don’t know about that. I’m still hurting.” He says, “You’re good. I have to go back to work.” It’s like he took time out to see me, but I didn’t make an appointment. I’m thinking that was bold of me to just show up at his house. I go to put my shirt back on, but can’t find it. When I do find it, I can’t get it on. The nakedness is not a big deal to either of us in the dream. My son has been playing with cars and toys this whole time. It takes me three tries to get my shirt on and I finally get it on. In the meantime, there’s somebody in the room that is working with or for Jacob. He’s in a car - like those cars little kids drive around, but slightly bigger because an adult can fit in it. He’s driving around the office. I want to see it and get in. But Jacob is politely ushering me out. I am walking out the door with my son and then say, “Oh yeah, one more thing…” I can’t remember what I say or ask. He responds, but I don’t remember what it is. Then he says, “Now I have to go to the bathroom.” Suddenly there is a bathroom right there by his front door. He just walks over and starts peeing. There’s a level of comfort and this is not a big deal for anyone. I say, “Okay, I’ll see myself out. Bye.” We go out and get in the car. The car is kind of weird - it’s like a Buik convertible. My son has a bunch of miniature figurines that he’s been playing with. He’s stuck them on the window of the car. I’m ready to go, but they all fall off. I go to hit the brakes to let him pick them all up because they’ve all fallen on the ground. But it takes me forever to find the brakes. I finally find them, but they don’t work that well. So I need to put the car in Park so it doesn’t move. This whole time the car is rolling and my son is yelling at me because it’s rolling over some of his figurines. He’s getting upset like I’m not listening to him or I don’t care about his figurines. I’m like, “Hey baby, I’m sorry. I’m trying very hard but the brakes aren’t working and I’ve gotta get it in Park.” So I get it in Park and he picks up some of his things. But then this happens all over again - it happens twice - I’m trying to stop the car, I’m rolling over some of his stuff, I’m scared I’m going to roll over him, the brakes don’t work that well, and I have to put the car in Park to get it to stop. Then this part of the dream starts to fade away. There’s one last piece where I park the car and am helping him out. I look to my left and see a hillside. It’s not that tall. As I’m watching, the hill starts to recede and a massive skull with horns - it looks like an ox skull maybe - emerges from the side of the hill. It’s larger than a regular ox skull. I’m looking at it, going like, “Where did that come from? What does that mean?” There is mold growing on one patch of the skull. I note this as strange because I’ve never seen mold growing on bones and mold usually grows on flesh. Why is that on there? Total scene change. There’s water everywhere. I’m in a town on the edge of the ocean. It’s a seaside town. I’m staying in a hotel. I left the hotel to go somewhere and now I’m trying to go back to the hotel because that’s my shelter. When I left the hotel, everything was normal - no water on the streets, cars driving on the streets, things going on as normal. But now I’m on my way back and the sea has come in. There’s water everywhere and it’s raining. There’s so much water. I’m driving back to the hotel in a car and the water is going over the top of the car. Somehow I’m staying dry inside. I realize the car isn’t going to be able to get through the road because there’s an intersection in front of me and I’m just watching the waves crashing into this intersection. The waves are almost as high as the stoplights. I’m like, “The car is not going to get through.” I get out because I think that’s a good idea. I’m trying to swim and walk my way home. Somehow that is working better than trying to drive the car. The waves are crashing and crashing - they crash and they pull back, they crash and they pull back - and it’s just dumping rain. Everything is covered in water and everyone is trying to get through the water to their homes or high ground.",Rose,last_nights_dream

Everyone was so calm and collected and moved so gracefully. I didn’t. My stuff was everywhere. My motorcycle was in the middle of the impeccably landscaped garden and I had to move it out during a seminar and it was so distracting and noisy and awkward.

My friends seem to be representing the white women doing anti-racist work. There is another scene where I am leaving an AirBnB house with Veronica, Gail, Irene and my sister. We were on retreat discussing current events, racism and ant-racism. The ladies are getting in the car. I’m hanging around cleaning up the kitchen. The kitchen is a big mess and a woman arrives to help me clean. I’m putting dishes and foods away and making sure we bring home the dishes and foods that belong to us. My son is with the other ladies and they’re waiting for me. They say, “Come on, Viviane. We’re going to get back to the city really late and we’ve gotta go. It’s already after 3 and we won’t be home until after 9 now.” We were supposed to leave in the morning. I’m impressed with how the woman has cleaned the kitchen.

One of them is totally cool and looks like green pearls that hang down. There are other leafy ones. That setting is quite beautiful. The energy and vibration coming from the plants is amazing and healing. But I don’t feel very comfortable talking to my mom - I feel like she wants something from me and I’m not wanting to give it to her. She wants kindness from me, I think. I do not want to give her any compassion and kindness. I’m faking it though and going through the motions. There’s another piece of the dream where I am holding my son as a toddler, he’s maybe 2 or 3. I’m just loving on him and he seems pretty content. I put him down to play. We’re hanging out next to each other and both of us are doing the parallel play that toddlers do. Then all of a sudden, in my mind, I go, “Oh my god, I’m an adult and yes, he’s content and happy where he is right there, but actually we need human connection.” I pick him up and his demeanor changes from very content and quiet toddler play to this absolute snuggly. His little body clings to me and he’s so much happier when I pick him up, love on him and include him instead of putting him down so he does his thing and I do my thing. It just dawns on me that I need to be holding him and carrying him. The connection between the two of us enlivens and blossoms and blooms. It’s so much better and deeper the second I pick him up and look at him in his face and eyes and he looks back at me.

There are two other sex workers in the room with me - women - who are in his employ. I’m seeing the strangest view of the vulva and vagina. It’s like it’s mine, but I’m looking at it from the point of view of the lover. It’s weird and doesn’t look like what a vulva and vagina look like. It’s like a tube that actually looks like a hollowed out penis. It’s so strange. Then I go back into my body and I’m on my back. I can see my lover and he’s over me. He has a fork. He’s sticking the fork in my vagina which looks like this weird tube thing. The whole time I’m like, “Oh my god, that’s going to hurt! What is he doing with that?” This is maybe my lucid mind coming in because my dreaming mind is just going along with this dream. In the dream I’m like, “Yup, that’s what I want, let’s go for that.” Then I do this weird thing while I’m lying on my back - I cross my legs and watch my pelvis turn to the right, then my legs go into a splits. The two female sex workers grab my feet. Each of them have a fork and they’re scratching my skin with the fork. It’s like some very strange BDSM play. I’m like, “Yup, this is what I want. Go for it. It’s okay.” But the lucid part of me is like, “What the fuck? Why are you letting these people do that to you?” I’m observing this weird dynamic where I am simultaneously choosing it and in my power, but obviously just giving up my power for this thing that is super painful and I’m not enjoying at all. I’m literally getting forked. That ends at some point. I get off the bed and go to the two sex workers and say, “Here let me show you how to use your power now.” It’s as if everything that just happened there was me in my sovereign self, which I clearly wasn’t.

They had adopted a young black boy and raised him. He is now an adult and is part of the wedding ceremony. I don’t know how this makes sense in terms of time. The matrix of time is mixed up. I’m standing at the front and people are gathered for the wedding. My mom is wearing a white gown. There are two young girls at the front with us, standing to my right. The ceremony begins and the younger girl is to do a reading. Everyone is looking at her expectantly. Instead of reading her paper, she puts it in a muddy puddle and smears mud all over the words so they are incomprehensible. We are all shocked and upset by her behavior. I try to rescue the paper and wash it in the water so she can read the words clearly. But she smears it with dirt again. I hold the paper up to the light to read the words, but I cannot read a thing. We have to put that paper down and change the plans. My mom gives me a collage that she made. It’s like a paper quilt of square images with lovely bright colors and quotes and cutouts of her in blue silky lingerie dresses - maybe pictures she had made for my dad. There are also two green magnets. She’s telling me how to read the collage for the ceremony. She moves the magnets around, so one magnet is at the beginning of the reading and the other shows where to stop reading. As we are looking, it sort of makes sense. I hold out the paper and begin, but as I’m reading, the collage changes size, the magnets move, the words turn into Spanish and others turn into Sunday morning type cartoons. I keep trying to read it, but it gets more and more convoluted. The people are just looking aghast at how unprofessional the ceremony is and how lost I appear in trying to read.

It’s a larger celebration with more people than normal. Many of them I don’t know. Because of this, her interactions with me are less frequent than they normally would be as she is running around greeting all the guests. I’m looking for someone I know. I’m reluctant to go into the house. I’ve arrived there with my son. He’s playing with some of the other kids of the people I don’t know. I have an eye on him. He’s about 4 or 5 years old in the dream. I know where he is and I can see he’s fine. I’m sitting on the grass enjoying the sun on my skin. I’m noticing the plants she has planted in her garden. I’m waiting for some of the people to greet her and settle somewhere, so we can have a conversation and I can give her the gift that I brought. However this doesn’t seem to be happening as there are a lot of people coming and going. So I decide to go for a walk. I look for my son. He’s not outside anymore. I ask someone if they’ve seen him. They say, “Yes, he went down that hallway.” They indicate with their finger which hallway. So I go down there, looking in the rooms with open doors.

I see my son in a different bathroom across the hallway from the bathroom where her husband is in. My son is playing in the water. He’s taken off all his clothes. I ask him if he’ll get dressed and I tell him we’re going for a walk. He complies but is taking a really long time to do it. While he’s doing that, I exit the bathroom, continue walking down the hallway to the very last room and see my friend in there sitting and talking with a couple of women. She waves me over and I sit in a chair beside her. The conversation they started before I came into the room continues. It’s not about anything I care to converse about. It’s like, “What are we wearing today” - flat and doesn’t feel meaningful. I sit with them for a few minutes and then go back to the washroom where my son is. He’s dressed now. I take him by the hand and we start walking down the hallway and out. I notice for the whole duration of this dream, my friend’s husband is in the bathroom. As we’re leaving her house, I see a pair of plastic shorts. They’re kind of long - they go almost down to the top of the knee. There’s a perforated line where you can rip off the last 4 inches and make them into a normal length pair of shorts. For some reason, I pick them up and I do this. I fold at the perforated line and rip off the bottom 4 inches. Then I roll them up and am looking for a bag to put them in. I notice there’s a tag on them that says Size 10. I think, “Whose are these?” Then I’m looking for my friend to give them to. I look down in my hand and suddenly I also have a birthday card. Now I feel surprised that I appear to have picked up something in her house that doesn’t belong to me - a pair of transparent plastic shorts - and now I’m going to give them to her. I don’t want to because I feel like I haven’t purchased this fairly; I’ve just picked them up and taken them. It’s not even something I would give to her. I’m looking for a place to set these down. They just disappear out of my hand. Now I’m with my son on the outside of the house. I take him by the hand and we continue on our walk. We go all the way around the block - it’s a nice walk. When we come back, there are still all these people I don’t know. I feel like I don’t belong there. I’m relieved to see her husband isn’t there. She’s sitting on the porch.

It’s like I have some kind of amnesia that’s just gradually coming back throughout the meal I can recall in the dream. The meal is situated in Ojai where I did all my yoga teacher training. Except it’s not at the Piazza. It’s at the Casita. I’m in a large kitchen. I’m sitting at the table by myself. I’m feeling like no one wants to talk to me and if I do speak, my voice won’t be heard. I feel invalidated. The food preparation which is normally shared is not even being shared this day. The food is brought in various containers, some of which appear to be styrofoam. I feel let down by that. I feel like the lack of community preparation and resorting to calling for takeout in a non-sustainable container is showing me that this is not what I’m here for. I was here for authentic community sharing. I feel duped that the community meal is actually a takeout. Now Lana is opening up all the containers and dividing each container pretty much evenly onto 16 plates. There are quite a few containers, probably 20. She looks mindless while she’s doing this and is doing it hurriedly with her hands. Once all the plates are ready, people just come and take one. They’re not even sitting at the table. They are taking their plate and going off to some other area by themselves. I don’t go. I notice that about 10 plates are gone. Then I get mine. I didn’t even realize people had started helping themselves. So I take one and sit down at the table. My teacher sits down beside me as though he’s expecting everyone to also be at the table because he sits down right beside me the way you would sit down at a table when you’re expecting it to be full. I’m already eating my food. He’s silent. He eats a few bites then asks where everybody is. I tell him I don’t know. He seems concerned about this. He gets up and moves a little bit away, giving me some space. Then he’s looking around. What it does is it creates the feeling for me that the students are acting as a group within a group. We’re all here to learn from him. We’re all trainees. But in this scene, he’s no longer the teacher, at least not for what has happened in our network.

824,1179,,10/06/2020,06/10/2020 00:02,"A lot of different parts to this dream. I’m with a friend, Vanessa, she was another white girl who would hang out with my hula halau. She wouldn't actually dance, but she lived across the street from my kumu’s house and she would watch the kids. She was a super humble woman and also a lesbian. She’s making dinner for us - she was very much a caretaker. She’s making a meal. I’m excited for it. But I taste it and it doesn’t taste good - something feels a little bit off about it. Somehow my friends from where I live now, Austin and Aila - they own a cattle ranch - are in the dream, too. There is food that Austin is contributing because they raise cattle for eating. There’s a table where Vanessa is making the food and white walls everywhere else. When Aila and Austin show up, we are in her house, which is gorgeous. It’s a two-story house with windows that go from the floor to the second story on one side. Her kitchen is big and beautiful. She’s upset about something. She leaves. Austin starts to tell us that she’s trying to kill herself - she’s been eating poison. I’m wondering what’s going on. Why is she doing that? I keep asking him if I can go see her or find her. He says, “I can’t even find her.” He also says, “No, leave her be. She wants to be alone.” I’m really worried about this. He says, “Come with me.” I go with him. Now there are other people around and I’m not quite sure who they are - it might be my siblings or other people we both know. He says, “We have a job to do, so let’s give Aila her space. Let’s go do our job.” We go to a Home Depot or Lowe’s type of place with hardware and all the stuff you’d find at those kinds of places, as well as their garden center. He says, “Everybody grab a plant.” We all have to bring a plant with us. I have a plant in my hand and am feeling good about having this plant - a green lush hanging plant. Whoever else I’m with is young because it feels like Austin is directing us all. He’s in charge of directing us and giving us a task. So now all of us have plants. We’re filing through the checkout line with our plants. Then, Austin and the others start to recede. Even the hardware store starts to recede. What comes forward is what seems to be Lahaina in Maui. But it does not actually look like Lahaina, at least not the Lahaina I remember. I’m there and I’m on the street. My plant is gone now. I think I’m with one of my brothers. We are walking through the streets. I have this feeling of homesickness and longing. Even though the streets don’t look like Lahaina, the palm trees are there, the tall papaya trees the banyan, and the monkeypod trees are there. We’re in a neighborhood and walking down these streets with houses on them. At one point, there’s a really big hill that I need to walk up. Through all of this, my brother is with me. Then he disappears. I’m now wandering through a part of Lahaina that feels barren or industrial - it doesn’t feel beautiful like Hawaii is. My mom and dad show up and say, “Here, come with us. We’re going this direction.” They’re young - they don’t look like who I grew up with, but like who they looked like before kids. So I follow them to the end of the road. They get in this line. There’s a crowd of people and a house. The house is freaking beautiful. Suddenly, the Ko’olaus are there. At the end of this road, we’ve passed through this weird area that doesn’t look like Hawaii and now we’re at this house that does look like Hawaii. There’s an avocado tree growing in the yard. The backdrop is all these green luscious Ko’olau mountains. There’s a crowd of people all there to see the wizard that lives at this house at the end of the road where everything is lush and green. He has some answers for everybody. My parents say, “You have to be very respectful. You may not be invited in. He may not talk with you.” Then I see the wizard come out of his house. He wanders up the side of his lawn. There is a thick grey wall between the neighborhoods and the magical place of green and avocado trees and lusciousness. I’m on the side of the wall that is the neighborhood side. The wizard invites two people in at a time to talk with him. He’s saying, “We’re not going to go into my house this time. You can ask me questions out here in my yard.” His yard is the base of the Ko’olaus so it goes up really steeply. I’m watching from the side of the wall as all these people go and ask their questions of him. My parents turn. I have an old point and shoot camera, and this other woman grabs the camera out of my hand. I’m trying to take pictures of the green mountains - not of the wizard and my parents. The beauty is so breathtaking that I want to take a picture of it. But this woman comes up. She is a tourist with an accent, not from the US. She grabs my little grey camera and she goes to advance the film - the way you do by pulling back on the lever. But instead of doing that, she starts winding the film up, the way you do when you finish a roll. I can hear her breaking the camera as she does that. I’m saying, “No, that’s not how you do it. You’re not actually being helpful.” But she thinks she’s being so helpful. I’m looking at the camera and thinking if I try to advance it just once it will be okay. I try and it doesn’t work. I can see where it is and open it up, but I know if I do, I will ruin the film. I do open it up and see that sure enough the film on the inside is broken. So there’s no camera, no pictures. This woman was in line behind my parents who had been talking with the wizard this whole time. I go around the wall and sneak up and sit down to hear what he has to say. There is a sense that he will teach me and share with me what he knows. My parents didn’t think it was time for me to learn from him because I’m a kid to them, but I know I’m me and I can definitely learn all the things that need to be learned about magic from a wizard. He agrees to start teaching me. I sit down with him in his yard at the base of these mountains. There’s one other piece of the dream where I’m the observer. It’s a young couple - teenage kids. They’ve run off together. They’ve run away from their families so they can be together even if it’s just at the beach, which is where I’m seeing them. She’s definitely the one who is more riled up and instigating and pushing it. He has fear of his parents and retaliation, but he really loves her and wants to be with her. So the two of them are just hanging out for now. I see him sitting at a dock and she says, “Hey, we’ve gotta go do these things. We have to get away from our family, society and culture that say we can't be together.” The boy is a Latino boy. The girl is white. At one point she drops herself into the ocean off the edge of this dock. I’m like, “Oh gross, the water is not clean. There is too much pollution. This sandy beach you were sitting on is covered in micro-litter. It’s just not clean.” The boy is saying, “It’s not clean. Don’t go in there.” She says, “No, we only live once. We have to do these things. Come into the water. Play with me.”",Rose,last_nights_dream
825,1385,,10/06/2020,06/10/2020 00:03,"“The Curio Shop” My kids and I have ridden our bicycles to this shop on a street where everything is closing down. The whole street is closing down and everything is 50-80% off. We need some spoons. I’m hoping I can get some yarn. So we go to the Curio Shop. It’s the kind of store that is packed with all kinds of stuff in it. There are a lot of people in it, too - about four shopkeepers, a couple men, a couple women. The walls go up really, really high. You can’t even see what’s on the top shelves. My kids are looking at various things. I feel pulled in different directions. I also don’t want them to get involved in looking at stuff. We’re only there to get yarn and a spoon. They’re being pulled towards the back of the shop and the spoons are in a jar in the front of the shop. I go back to get them. The floor slopes downwards like a loading ramp at the back of the shop. One of my kids is stuck there. I notice that there is some really dirty murky water. There are creatures that live in the water. One of them has reached up and has a hold of one of my children and is starting to pull him into the murky water. So we pull him - we’ve got his arms and legs. Instead of pulling just him up, this strange creature that's attached to him comes with him. I don’t know how to describe it. It’s purple, but it’s red, but it’s blue. It’s got fur all over. The fur doesn’t look soft. It looks a little bit creepy but also a little bit cute. So now there’s this creature in the store and my son’s got him. I don’t want to put it back in the water because it wants to stay with us and the water looks decidedly evil, so I feel it’s the wrong thing to do. So we carry on. We go back towards the front of the store and finally the line has moved. I see the wooden spoons with long handles for stirring things in a big pot. The crowd around is gone. I look at the price and even though they’re half off, they’re still really expensive and I don’t think I need a spoon that badly. I don’t want to spend the money on it. The shopkeeper does ask me what I’m looking at it. I say I was looking at the spoons. She comes over and points out the price. There are six prices and she says, “It’s this one.” I still think it’s expensive and say I don’t want it. In the meantime, I turn around and my son is missing. I say, “Where’s my son?” One of the male shopkeepers says, “You’ll have to follow me.” So I go out of the store and I can feel myself getting really angry. My daughter is still with me. When I go out of the store, theThey tell me I have to come back the next day. I’m like, “What?!” and it just bursts out of my body. I’m raging at them. They say that I have to follow them because now I'm being processed. I have to go into this building with them for this processing. We walk about three really long city blocks up the street into another building that looks like it’s been a warehouse. My daughter and I are sitting there. I’m waiting for the officers to do what they need to do. One of them tells me I have to follow hi. We go around the side of the building and there are a whole bunch of storage units. He has a key. There are two doors side by side and they have Disney characters on the front of them. I think that’s strange. He opens the door and there's nothing in the storage unit. He tells me I have to follow him in there. I say, “No way am I following you. There is nothing I need to do in there alone with you in that storage unit!” So I start to run back into the building. I grab my daughter and I say, “Run! We have to get out of here!” So we start running. I don’t want to go into the street, so we are going behind the buildings. There are tall bulrushes and mucky water and we are rushing around. I can see both of them. We’re still ahead of them. All of the buildings are deserted but locked - we can’t get in. So we keep running. We find this building and the door is open in the back. There appears to be other people conducting business around the front and I think, “Well, let’s go in there. There are other people.” The door opens, we go up the stairs to a fashion fabric kind of thing. People are trying on clothes and whatnot. I say to my daughter, “Let’s change our clothes, “ so we do. Then I see that the other officer (not the one who wanted me to go into the storage unit with him). He’s right there. I tell him, “Your partner was trying to take me into the storage unit at the back. Come on, you can’t be doing things this wrong. I just want my son back.” He’s not helpful. In fact, he’s in league with the other one. So now we’re running in front of the building where the people are, which halts the officers. They can’t just grab us for nothing. We go out the front, which is busy with customers and other people. So we are trying to lose them in the crowd and we do this for about a block until we get back to the store. We find our way back to the store. I go to the front of the desk. There are still lots of people in there and the two women shopkeepers. I say loud enough that the other people around me can hear: “You’ve got my son! You’re holding him and I want him back.” Then I jump over the counter because the officer is behind there. I grab him by the throat and I tell him that he better give me my son back, or I will strangle him. So he says, “Fine fine, okay!” He writes this phone number down. I say, “A phone number?! Are you kidding me?!” I take the phone number and am trying to dial it. Now I’ve got one of those old fashioned flip phones. The numbers on the pad are really small. Every time I try to dial the number, it shows up on the screen wrong and I keep having to erase it and do it again, and erase it and do it again. I’m standing outside the building now. I keep putting the number in. It’s a 10-digit number. Now I’ve got 7 of the numbers put in. It’s like 164576476470, like that. The 4’s and 7’s won’t work. The two men that are shopkeepers that turn into officers are standing outside of the building. Now I’m sobbing and saying, “Just tell me where he is. Just go get him.” One of them says he’s in the basement. “The basement of this building?!” I yell at him. But the space between me and the building is getting bigger and bigger. I’m crying and sobbing and so angry. Now my emotions have broken through the dreamworld and I’m awake. I’m trying to get back into the dream, but I can’t.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

We were all supposed to read it and there were different versions. There was one in a gift shop but Elon Musk bought all the good copies and I got one that was a basic generic version. A woman with long brown hair and I bonded because she got the same basic version - later we both remarked that we should have gotten the one with the global world view or universalist view, not just American! “How small minded of us,” we laughed! There was this idea that there was a broader view larger than global, larger than maybe even universal, and we were acknowledging the barrier to learning. We made a plan to meet up later, and we were walking on the world like walking on the globe. We were space walking, but it was like on trees and we were going from planet to planet like it was nothing.

At the center of the city was this university and the head of the science department is also the mayor of the town. She does shady things - started changing pretty rapidly around town. Lots of restrictive rules were set in place. I was one of the land tenders and was working in the field. I just started noticing really weird things like huge holes in the ground covered with netting. I fell through the net and into the mud and it was pretty far down. There was a crawl space if you crawl through the mud, so the actual ground that we thought was the ground wasn’t. It was like a false layer of ground held up by a net in mud and dirt and then underneath that like a 2 foot crawl space between the net and the actual ground. I told somebody on the compound about it and they just replied: “The world is not as it seems,” and then they kind of entered into a trance. It seemed like their eyes glazed over and they just kept repeating that same thing: “The world is not as it seems,” and also other sorts of prophetic sayings. I got really freaked out and walked away and decided not to tell anybody else about the crawl space. Then this person became kind of like the town crazy person and stopped taking care of themselves. You could find them all the time leaning against or sitting against the wall of the main food court, kind of rocking back-and-forth like in prayer and repeating prophetic things - prophecies and such. I was taking a walk one day around the outside of the compound and I found this beautiful flower garden and I was wandering through it. I found a doorway into the lab which is also where the mayor and the head scientist of the lab worked. All the doors were unlocked on my side because I think I went through a secret back entrance and I started feeling I was getting really close to the truth. As I went in closer to the heart of the truth, the building was getting smaller around me - doorways or smaller, thinner hallways. There was one last hallway that was actually at this point kind of like an air duct size. I shimmied through and I couldn’t fit through the last door. I got my legs out but it got stuck at my thighs and then somebody saw me and started chasing me. I don’t think I’ve ever been to where we were because I was also tripped out by the size of the room and also got stuck and all of a sudden the whole building lifted up and was like an aircraft and the scientist began speaking over the loudspeaker a prayer and a prophecy and explaining the new order.",Tita,last_nights_dream

They’re European or Swedish by nationality, but ethnicity ranges with Asian girls and black girls. They’re all female-bodied and from this one school. They’re sitting in rows in desks and I’m facing them, looking at them. There’s a big green screen behind them. To their right is a male teacher/interviewer. He is asking them these trivia quotations and they’re answering. But he’s a little bit off. Every once in a while he says something that’s super off-color or super sexist or just super objectifying. At one point I hear him saying, “And don’t they all have glorious tits?” I’m like, “What the fuck did he just say?” He says that kind of stuff, but the girls, instead of taking offence, they just own it and make it their own - not in the giggling way and giving away of power, but in a “oh so you noticed, idiot, good.” It’s a very interesting dynamic.

This is all being televised and people are watching. At some point, my focus shifts from these young ladies to the show host. He kind of beckons me over. He wants me to look at the green screen. So I get close to him and say, “Okay, what do you want?” He says, “Look really carefully at this screen.” On the green screen is a map of the world. He says, “They’re only showing you part of it.” As he says that, suddenly all these spots on the green screen that are showing the globe burst into flames - not physical flames, but a simulation of flames that are all over the world. He says, “They’re not showing you everything. The world is on fire in so many more ways and places than you think.” I’m like, “Oh god!” kind of like conspiracy theory style, but also not - just the plain facts that there is so much more burning than we think. In part of the show he was asking these young ladies, “What do you think of environmentalism? What do you think about racism?” As in what are your solutions? What can we do about it? It’s been a very interesting dynamic where with his questions he is teasing out their knowledge and their wisdom, but also saying really fucked up things and showing how this world is on fire in ways that we don’t know and places that we don’t know. Be aware that there’s so much more going on. Then the dream shifts to the shores of a beach - it’s super rugged and rocky, but not too windy. The sun is out. There’s a breeze. My son is with me. We’re going to a picnic or barbecue with people. There are all kinds of people. My son is at my shoulder and his presence stays with me, but he wanders off to go play and have fun. I’m watching these men. Some are black and some I don’t know their color. They’re tossing a football and I’m like, “I want to play.” They throw me the football and I’m throwing it with a really good spiral. The thought crosses my mind: “Wow, there’s a lot of sun. I’m glad I have sunscreen on my face and my hair.” But then I look down and I’m wearing one of these tops from when I was a kid. It’s an 80’s crop top with elastic on the bottom and top and you can pull it down off the shoulders and there’s a ruffle, so the ruffle is on the top and you pull it down over your shoulders. It’s a gross, not attractive cream color. It has way too much yellow in it. It’s not a good color on me. I look down and all of that skin that is exposed - over the shoulders and top of the chest - is burnt.The rest of me had sunscreen on, but that is burnt. I’m like, “Oh god!” and realize that I need to get into the shade. It’s interesting, this scene begins with a rugged beach and coastline, but there’s grass where I’m throwing the football, and past that are trees - a forest of oak trees, really gentle. I give up playing football because I realize how burnt I am. I’m walking toward the trees because I want to get into the shade. I pass two black women sitting on the grassy part. They are having their lunch and talking. I notice how they have their eyes on me as I’m walking past. They were relaxed and laughing and enjoying each other, but as soon as I get close, their entire demeanor and bodies change to this wariness like, “Oh god, what is this white girl going to say? What is she going to do?” It breaks my heart because I see them disappear and I see them tracking me to make sure I’m not going to do anything. I try to make a joke how I managed to burn the fuck out of my skin. They do the polite laugh, but there’s not real connection. It’s fucking heartbreaking because I want that real connection. So I continue on to get out of their space and head to the trees, so I can take care of my burn. Then I get into the trees and the scene changes again. Now I see a walkin to a freezer and a supply closet where there are tasks to do. There’s a crew of us. We’re in some sort of building - maybe a grocery store. There’s a really low ceiling and I’m feeling quite claustrophobic. There is a manager and I don’t know them in real life. The manager is handing out tasks for everyone to do. A lot of the people have been given tasks where they have to leave this small space then come back. But I am not. The task they give me makes me stay in this small space where I feel so claustrophobic and cold. I’m going in and out of this walkin freezer and this space that feels like a supply closet. It’s so crowded and there’s not a lot of room. I’m looking at the manager like, “Can I get a different job? This is so tedious and so claustrophobic.” The manager is like, “Nope, this is the one you have.” I’m like, “Yeah, but I could do a job where I can be outside and move my body. I’m just stuck in this spot doing this very tedious, repetitive task.” I think the task is cleaning the shelves or something. I am like, “This is not going to last long.” No, just no. I’m feeling boxed in and just doing something that does not use my skills to the best of my ability, but the manager is stubborn about me doing it. It’s frustrating.",Rose,last_nights_dream
842,1387,,12/06/2020,06/12/2020 00:08,"“The Scaffold” This dream begins in some kind of childcare setting. I’ve applied to work there. The dream opens up on what I think is my first day of work. So I walk into a classroom. There are maybe 13 to 15 kids and they look to be around an early school age, like 5 or 6 years old. There are two teachers attending them. As soon as I arrive in the room, they leave. I think, “Wow, way to throw me into this.” But within a few minutes, another teacher comes in and she introduces herself. She tells me she's there to train me. I think, “Well, that’s good then because that was my understanding.” She starts describing the curriculum to me and giving me a little bit of information about each child. I’m taking this in and feeling that sounds familiar, as I’ve worked in this kind of educational setting before. We start to collect what we’ve done with the kids up and tell them it’s time to put their things away and get ready to go outside for outdoor time. The kids start going out the door. There’s something out in the playground. It’s really, really large. It’s large enough that it’s leaving a shadow on the window of the classroom. I can’t see how high up it goes. It’s quite looming. There are some men on it who are working on it, too. It has the feel of one of those scaffolds that construction sites have where you climb up and up and up to work on something at the top. It’s a safe platform for people as opposed to a ladder, which is not very safe and kind of flimsy. So there are a few men on this and they’re busy with it. I do note (not in my dream, but after waking), one of the men is black. There are also some plants that are starting to overgrow the bottom of whatever structure this is. They’re moving from this structure into the building. So while the person who is training me is supervising the playground, I am trying to moveis plant that is starting to grow inside the door of the classroom. It feels really strong in my hands. When I pick it up, it’s like a vine and fits into the palm of my hand like a rope that’s about 1 inch in diameter. Every time I try to move it away from the door, it just grows back. I’m doing this the whole time during playground time. The teacher and kids start to come back in the room now because outdoor time is over. We’re setting up for the after outdoor time curriculum. I feel that I’m starting to get sick. So, I get a paper towel from the wall, put it over my mouth and I get sick into it. I notice that the vmit is all blood colored, although it’s not blood. It’s like food or something like food. Then I put it in the garbage. I start to do something else, I feel myself getting sick again, so same thing - paper towel off the wall, vomit, put it into the garbage. I go to the sink in the classroom. I wash my hands, I wash my face. I come back to what I’m supposed to be doing. I am facilitating an activity at one of the tables. I’m only doing that for a few minutes when I get sick again. So I’m trying to hide this now because it’s my first day on the job and I’m training. I just want to finish out the day. I’m not feeling overly sick in my body. It’s just that this keeps happening. I keep vomiting. I keep throwing the paper towel out and then I’m fine. So I’m doing this until there’s another woman who comes into the room. Now I notice that the classroom has two sides. The other side is completely empty. There is no curriculum going on there, no teachers, no students. When this other woman comes in, she says to me: “How are you doing on your first day?” I say, “Oh fine, I’m completely comfortable with this.” She said, “Well that’s good because I hired you to run the senior school program in this other side of the building. We’ve lost our teacher and that’s really what I had earmarked for you.” I feel a little bit surprised about this because I thought I was going to be hired to team teach with someone and I was really looking forward to team teaching. But, if that’s the job, then I’m not going to turn it down. So I ask her how much longer I have for training. She says, “Another week or two. You let me know when you’re comfortable.” I think, “Well okay, that’s good then.” But as we’re talking, I feel another urge to be sick. So I take another paper towel off the wall and I’m 06sick into it. I surreptitiously wipe my mouth and put it in the garbage. I do this several times while she’s showing me around the empty classroom and describing what she wants to have go on in there. Then she looks at me and says, “Are you being sick?” I say, “Yes, I am.” She says, “That’s interesting. You’re not the only person who has been sick here. We’ve lost several teachers to the same thing.” I say, “Huh, because to me it seems that every time I touch that plant, “ and I indicate the one that keeps trying to overgrow through the door and into the windows, “I get sick after. I wasn’t sick before I got here.” I wasn't sick before I arrived.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

844,521,,13/06/2020,06/13/2020 00:01,"In my dream, the patient was in a room and I was running a group. There was a security guard there. The patient pinned the security guard to the wall and was reaching for the gun and when they couldn’t get the gun, they grabbed pushpins from a board on the wall. They were so rageful and angry I could feel it. (In real life when they are angry it is quickly followed by sadness and we are working on identifying this with them for soothing). They were so angry I could feel the force of the anger pushing me and I was pinned in the corner on the floor. We were eventually able to transition to a safer position because I was afraid security was going to hurt them - but I couldn’t find them! One of the nice male nurse assistants who has been around for 30 years showed me- the patient was on the floor- they had turned into a computer screen! I started singing to them and clapping my hands to try to turn them back into a person again and I was singing and clapping “Jai Jai Jai Jai” and then we all were. Then I went to what was supposed to represent the “other unit” (we have locked and unlocked and I primarily work locked) so in the unlocked unit there was a gym with all these machines set up closely together. I was stepping between them trying to get around in this big artificially lit room that looked nothing like the actual unit - it looked like a big gym. The patients all had their backs to me and were on exercise equipment that was like elliptical but straight legged almost like cross country skis hanging from the ceiling and they were sweating and sweating and got off the machines one by one. They didn’t clean them. In my dream I remember this annoyed me. It felt entitled.",Vera,last_nights_dream1
845,522,,13/06/2020,06/13/2020 00:02,"I was with someone else and maybe a small group of people and we were trying to get furniture for an apartment for someone we know. I had to watch scenes in my mind of people negotiating with the landlord about the different animals they could have. They had two small white dogs and a very small pet pig or something and there was another really small alligator or some reptile that could only stay in the kitchen and pace north to south on the kitchen floor, and there was like some type of instrument that would let us know that it was only going north to south, and it had covers over its feet. The two dogs were small white and matching and they could go anywhere in the apartment. I think the apartment was somewhere in New York City. It reminded me of New York somehow - it was for a couple but I don’t think it was for me. I was watching this like a movie. I was back with the group of people then we all went to IKEA to get the furniture and it turned into a mob. We were all walking counterclockwise and shoulder to shoulder and kept going in a circle trying to grab the items that we needed and couldn’t communicate with the other people we were with about what they were getting and we just kept throwing things into a pile of pillows and rugs. I kept trying to work my way over to people to make sure we were getting the right things but it was impossible to maneuver and there were all these different huge pillows that go on couches oversized on oversized like too big for words and it was really frustrating and I don’t even think they were for me- they went to the people in this apartment. Then it flashed back to the apartment and the landlord was saying something about how the reptile was doing okay going north to south in the kitchen but that he’s been hearing the couple argue in the corner of the apartment. The apartment was dark with hardwood floors that were dark wood and white tiles and I’ve never been there before.",Vera,last_nights_dream2

I didn’t have enough time to get there so I tried to trade that ticket in and the whole dream was just trying to get a ticket and not being able to get on the plane.

In another dream, I bought my mom a beautiful peacock necklace. But it was too expensive so I bought it for her. I also bought an expensive new pair of jeans. Then I was in some swimming pool place where they had classes for kids. The classes were listed. They were normal classes. Then all of a sudden I see one listed that said, “Jungian Archetypes” and thought that was a random class to have for children at a pool. Then there was an image of a cow having a baby calf.

850,1388,,13/06/2020,06/13/2020 00:07,"“The Vegetable Garden” I’m in the backyard of the house I grew up in. I’m maybe about 20 years old, possibly a little bit younger. I’m with my dad. He’s teaching me how to grow a6 vegetable garden. The plot is quite large. There’s room for enough vegetables that will have to be kept over the winter. It will definitely feed maybe 6-8 people for a whole year. It's planned out quite meticulously with companion planting as well as staggered planting so that you don’t get a bumper crop of the same thing all at once. There’s corn and cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, cauliflower, beets, carrots, squash, lettuce, rhubarb, and herbs; and marigolds and chrysanthemums around the outside as a natural insecticide. Once it gets planted, which is quite a lengthy process, then we have to go back in and set up structures that will support the things as they grow upwards. There is something that looks like it’s for tomatoes, but it’s not in the tomato row. It’s suspended and there’s little baskets. I can’t figure out how it’s suspended because there’s nothing above it except sky. Then when I look at it, there are bits of other vegetables in it. I can see that there are pieces of cauliflower, so I’m puzzling over this. It also spins. There are about four of these on a long bar. I ask my dad what it is. He keeps appearing. Although I’ve done this all by myself, whenever I’m not sure what I’m doing, my dad just appears for guidance. While I’m puzzling over this, suddenly he is there again. I say, “What’s this for?” He says, “The vegetables on it are composting. The gas they emit is good for the atmosphere that the other vegetables are growing in. It’s like a Natural Miracle Grower.” I think, “Oh. Hmm, I didn't think methane was good to be near people.” So I get this garden going. There’s also another part where I’m fertilizing or something. It’s like an extension of the natural compost where I’m taking some of the pieces from the plants - like when you prune or something starts to grow and the bugs have gotten it and it’s no good. I’m grating it up almost like a food processor. I’m putting it into cheesecloth and leaving the cheesecloth in various places in the garden. At one point my dad comes in and says to me, “Be careful with this one that no one eats it. It was too close to your body when you broke it down into tiny pieces.” It’s almost like I put it through a food processor. But I don’t know what I’ve got on my body that’s doing this to it. It’s some unknown thing. He says, “Don’t let people eat this. You have to put it back into the ground. Make sure you put it back in the ground.” It’s like it was in my body and my body did the breaking down of it. So now the garden is in a state where I can just wait for things to start producing. The dream shifts. I’m at some kind of setting that feels like my paternal grandparents’ party. The house isn’t there, though. It looks like it geographically. There’s a building and people live in the building. There’s an orchard growing lengthwise from the building. Sometimes people plant orchards around the building where they live, but this one extends laterally. There’s all this empty grass - it’s like a wild meadow. I’m inside the building. The woman I’m speaking with is in charge of the building and the people who live there. She’s asked me to come and advise on a vegetable garden for her community. I tell her that it's already almost the end of June and there isn’t enough growing time to plant the kind of garden she wants. She wants one similar to the one I have that is already well underway at my own place. She’s insisting though. So I have to debate the point and explain it further, because she really doesn’t understand that by the time September comes or even if the growing season gives her until October, she’s going to have a whole bunch of plants, but no fruit or vegetables because they don't have enough time to germinate now in this type of weather. I do manage to convince her by saying, “However, this doesn’t mean there is nothing you can do this year. So what needs to be done is the grass and what you’ve got growing on the land for the vegetables needs to be removed. It can be aerated - tilled up. And there are a few things you can plant in long rows that have a short germination period. It will help to get everyone we’re training to be gardeners used to it this year.” So she agrees to that. So she says, “I’m going to get some people to help.” I see her doing this. Now I’m standing at a thing you leaned on at a reception counter, but it’s not. There are people who live there or staff that occasionally come out of a door behind that and then go back in. I don’t know what they’re doing. It’s not food service. So she’s standing behind there and as people come out the door, she’s asking them if they want to be part of the vegetable garden and they’re all saying no. I think, “Hmm, this isn’t going to go very well here in the way she’s presenting it.” I leave her to that and step off a bit to the side. There are a couple of other women that have a box. It’s got wallets in it that look handmade with carvings and are beautifully painted. There are some people, one of which is one of my YTT students. They’ve ordered wallets and are waiting to pick them up. One of them says to me, “Look, aren’t these beautiful?” She’s matching it with a matching hat and clothes she has on - indigo blues, pink and white. I think, “Wow, she’s really beautifully color coordinated.” But I don’t want to look in the box because I don't have any money and I don’t need a wallet to carry my money in. I also don’t want to spend my money on something I don’t need anyway. I make the comment to the person selling them that they are quite beautiful. Then I move away from that area. I go back to the lady and ask if she has any recruits for the garden. She says, “Not yet.” then someone comes out and the woman herself looks really downcast and defeated. I see the first woman, the one who is in charge, and instead of asking her if she wants to be part of this project, she tells her she has to. The person she says this to is every resigned. I think this whole presentation of community gardening is not going to work with this kind of asking without describing what it can do for them, or making it an order. So what I do is just leave the building. I walk to the area that will be used. I’m using my hands to pull up the grasses in a long straight line. The orchard trees on my left. I’m backing up with my body as I do this with my hands. One other person comes out - it’s the person who was ordered. I just allow her to watch as I do this. I do one long row of taking the grasses out. I'm doing it very slowly. The soil feels very fertile. It’s not hard. I can reach my fingers in and squish the soil. It’s dark and smells like earth. I know that whatever is grown here will eventually grow really well. I notice as my row is going very well, the other lady has just started and she’s mimicking what I’ve done. She’s doing it on her own and I just allow her to do that. The scene changes and it’s later. I’m just gazing at what I’ve planted. I think it’s radishes - they do germinate rather quickly. There’s a long row and they look really good.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream1

I’m just in that space with him. Then he gets up and leaves. I have his briefcase. I don’t want to be here. I carry his briefcase and go outside. It is bright daylight. It reminds me of being in a casino where they keep the lights dark so you don’t know what time it is, so the contrast is weird when I walk outside. I walk down this dirt road. There are fields on either side and barbed wire fences. I think I’m barefoot and I still have his briefcase. I keep walking. I am going past these houses and notice that some of them are old and falling apart - they are the original houses of the neighborhood. And then there are some new gigantic behemoth houses. The new houses are just huge - all I can see is rooftop after rooftop and I can’t even see the backend of these houses. Then I get past these houses and there are two separate little farms. The houses are older. It’s clearly a one-person show. Fruits and vegetables are planted and there are flowers. There’s also hay for mulching. I’m walking down the lane, then actually walk through the garden because it’s so inviting. Then I cross over this boundary - a space of land in between these two farms or houses with gardens - to go to the other little farm. Then I realize the ground underneath me is all hot coals, but my feet are not burning. I’m wanting to cross and get around, but suddenly I’m in a labyrinth and I can’t get out of it. The two owners of the house come out - two older white women. They are trying to help me get out of this little inbetween land that is basically all hot coals. It’s burning their feet, but not mine. They say, “Well, you can go that way, but you’re going to burn yourself.” But I’m not getting burned. I don’t go the way I think I’m going to go because they say I’m going to burn myself, but it’s not hot. At one point I do get out and wave goodbye to these women. As I’m walking down the lane, these dark hedges appear on either side, maybe to my shoulder height. I still have my dad’s black briefcase in my hand. Now I think I’m lost. So I pull an old-fashioned walkie-talkie out of the briefcase and press the button and am like, “Hey dad, can you come pick me up?” He goes, “How are you even contacting me?” I say, “I have your briefcase and it has this little walkie-talkie in it. Do you remember? It’s one of the original cell phones we used to have.” He says, “I thought I got rid of that a long time ago. How do you have it? How does it even work?” I keep saying, “I don’t know, but can you come get me?” He’s fixating on this thing. He doesn’t ever come get me. I end up in this house with a friend of mine. I don’t know her in real life. In the dream, she’s a kind, effervescent, bubbly, very innocent woman with dark hair. She’s very round with pale skin. Round cheeks, ample breasts, round butt. She and I are walking together. We’ve walked across a yard into a house. The guy who is there asks, “Can I help you?” because we just show up. She starts to make herself super comfy - gets water and starts to cook. The mother and father who own this house show up and they’re watching her move around. We’re all having small talk. It’s becoming more and more apparent that this woman is the perfect partner for the man in this house - the son of the couple that’s there. Everything she does, you see his eyes getting bigger and bigger and he’s like, “Oh my god, she does it like how I do it!” and “Oh my gosh, I never could figure out how to make bread rise and now she can make the bread rise!” She’s not showing off, and she’s very silly about it. He’s just suddenly smitten. The parents have this grin on their faces and are laughing and like, “Oh yes! Our son’s finally going to be married off!” They come together and you can see this is a little match made in heaven. We go back outside. Then the dream skips a bit and I don’t have the briefcase or walkie-talkie anymore. We are walking down a lane, but now all the houses are on my left, whereas before they were all on my right. There’s a big rolling hill - like the hills in Hawaii, covered in green grass. I can see up a ways that there is an outdoor patio with an outdoor fire pit like you’d see at a ski lodge. It’s the wedding because a bunch of people have gathered. I don’t recognize anyone except this couple who used to be my old neighbors in the condo I live in now, Rebecca and Oliver. Rebecca was pregnant while they lived here and now she’s pregnant again. I see them walking up the hill, but they have 7 or maybe 8 children. She’s carrying an infant and she’s very far along with another one. Maybe 9 kids all together. I’m gobsmacked because that’s so many kids and they’re all young - all under 5. Part of me doesn’t know how that’s possible. I just look at them and are like, “Are you guys done having kids?” And they’re like, “No, we love children.” I’m like, “Okay, well, if you’ve got the resources!” I’m looking at Rebecca and she looks a little haggard, but Oliver is right there with her helping with all the young kids. The dream ends with me wondering why they have so many kids.",Rose,last_nights_dream

So we go over and my son is in the playroom with him and his kids. Jack’s wife joins me in the kitchen. She brings an armful of dresses because I need a dress for the evening. She says that she feels like she’s already met me and I feel the same way. We look a lot alike and we are the same size. We have other things in common, too.

859,1183,,15/06/2020,06/15/2020 00:04,"It’s dark or nighttime. There are a bunch of us, all young, maybe teenagers or early twenties. The only person I recognize is my friend, Nani from high school. We’re all being trained to fly airplanes. It’s wartime. These are the kind of planes you see from old photos - the original planes that are all open with no cockpit and only room for one person. The airplanes are all lined up and we’re all lined up getting into our airplanes. I’m getting into my airplane and am wearing shorts - not enough clothes. So I suddenly think I should get some more clothes on. I have some because we are all packed and ready to go. I get some of the clothes out and put them on. I get in the airplane. We’re learning how to fly and have never taken a plane up before. It’s time to go fly these planes now. I’m a little panicked because I don’t feel like I know how to really fly the plane yet. But we go. The airplanes in front of me each start to take off. Then I take off. I’m flying okay. We’re all supposed to meet someplace before we head off to our attack. As I’m flying the plane, my heart is pounding because I don’t feel I have this down. I fly over this school. It’s a college - an old college with buildings with spires and ivy covering the brick walls. I’m flying over and around and I am trying to catch up with the group. I’m having a hard time flying the plane and end up going in circles around this college. I do end up landing the plane on a rooftop. It’s still dark - nighttime. I land the plane and get out on the roof. I climb down the wall and am looking in the windows of the building. There are kids inside. I climb down like I’m going to do some reconnaissance. The whole time I’m panicking that I’m not with the rest of the planes. I’m not really sure what it is I’m doing now, why I’m there or what I’m looking for. I am looking for something, though. There are tall trees on this campus. Then the dream switches and I’m wandering around a downtown I don’t recognize in real life. I see my older brother and he has a motorcycle. The motorcycle is light-weight. I’m not having any problem holding it and getting on it. There is a single battery or motor that you put on it. Without this battery, it’s just a bike. With the battery in it, I can ride it like a motorcycle. My brother and I are outside this building. It’s a rectangular, two-story building. You have to go downhill to a parking lot and walk upstairs to a restaurant at the top. He’s been working at the restaurant. He tells me to take the motorcycle and learn how to ride it. So again, I’m trying to learn how to work something that I don’t know how to ride. I say okay because I’ve always wanted to learn how to ride a motorcycle. But I don’t know how to shift gears with my hands. Somehow I manage it on my first ride. I ride around and I’m back in this downtown area. There is a little popcorn shop or I have an idea that I want to sell popcorn, but I’m like, “There was a popcorn shop down here once before and it failed, so that’s actually a terrible idea. Plus the overhead of having a cute little shop downtown where all you’re selling is popcorn is never going to add up. I will never make it.” These thoughts are going around in my head and I’m still on this motorcycle which I’ve parked. I went into a shop to talk to an owner about my idea. They’re encouraging me to do it. But I’m like, “It makes no sense to open a popcorn shop.” So I figure out that none of this is a good idea. The shop I’m in is narrow. It has really narrow walkways or pathways. I have to turn sideways to get through some of the places. So I leave this shop. I go to get on the motorcycle. But when I get to it, it’s a bike. The battery/motor is gone. I don’t know where it is. Now I’m just riding a regular bicycle, but the seat is really tall and the handlebars are really tall. I struggle to get on the thing, but I manage to. Now that I’m on it, I can see everybody and everything - I’m looking down at cars and people and I’m tall enough to see into the second story windows. I just want to go home. I’m ready to go home and get off this bike. I don’t know what happened to the battery thing. I want to be riding a motorcycle, not a super tall bike. I’m frustrated. It’s still dark. I am riding the bike through the streets and having a hard time because it’s really tall. My balance is not great and I’m afraid I’m going to fall off. I know which direction I need to go to go home and I have to keep going to my right because my home is in that direction and right is north. I just know I have to go that way, but it doesn’t matter to me how I’ll get home because I know all the roads will eventually get me there. So I’m riding, riding, riding, and think I’ll just take the roads in front of me and as long as I bear to the right most of the time, I should be fine. This pudgy young man with short dark curly hair, pale skin, glasses, khaki pants and short-sleeved collar shirt - very not threatening - is also riding his bike. He’s like, “Where are you going?” I say, “I’m just heading home.” He says, “I’ll ride with you for a little bit.” We start to get reckless, blowing through stop signs and not looking for cars. Because my bike is so tall, I go through a stop sign and this car comes and hits me. But my bike is so big that I roll over the back of the car and we keep going. There isn’t even really an impact. It bumps me, but that’s it. Both of us are riding through streets and at one point I ride through this kids playground. The kids have made all of these garden beds, and I’m like, “Oh god! I don’t want to ride over their garden beds.” So I veer off to the right and ride through their compost piles instead. As I’m riding through these streets, I’m riding over train tracks really quick. This guy that is with me is keeping up. He’s on a much lower bike - one of those recumbent bikes. We’re just having fun. It’s definitely reckless. I’m looking at some of the street signs and one of the streets I ride down is Queen Street. One of the streets I ride down has a tree tunnel. One of the streets is a hill I have to ride up, but it doesn’t seem to bother me and I’m not breathing hard. It’s no problem for me to get up this hill, even though it’s pretty steep. We’re flying through parts of town. I keep taking the road that goes to the right. That’s where the dream ends with me riding through all these streets with this guy. He does eventually veer off to the left to go home and says, “Okay, this is where we part ways.” I just keep riding, always to the right. Then the dream ends.",Rose,last_nights_dream
860,1390,,15/06/2020,06/15/2020 00:05,"“The Night Walk” This dream starts in a house that’s mine. It’s a different kind of house - open concept. It’s two levels. There is a lot of space in the rooms. There aren’t a lot of contents in each room. I cook something for supper. It’s some kind of pasta with weird sauce. There’s this piece of chicken with breading on it. My conscious mind is thinking, “Ew, I never make food like that.” The pasta is kind of dry and so is the chicken. I don’t make things with breading. I eat a little bit of supper and don’t really like it. I take about three bites and leave it. I tell my child - the child is a mixture of my son and daughter at the same time - we’re going to go for a walk after supper. It needs to be dark, so we are waiting until it gets dark. We leave out the house. I had something in my hand. The walk is down a path. We go out first through a field and then through an opening in some rocks which we go underneath. Then there is a fork and I say we need to take the path on the left. We climb up a steep ascent and navigate that. Then there’s a ridge to follow along. There’s a vista here before we climb up. Suddenly it zooms out and you can see how vast this landscape is - it’s like an escarpment and really quite beautiful. Then it zooms back in and we’re standing there. It’s a long hike. So we hike for probably half the night. I have this feeling in my body where it’s a tiny bit scary. But I have my child with me and I don’t want to communicate my own fear to my child. So I do quite well at appearing brave and courageous. The landscape is very pretty even in the night. There’s a feeling of lush. It feels Canadian with a mix of evergreen, deciduous trees. It’s cool, but not too cold or too hot. I can feel the packed dirt underneath my feet. It’s not too overgrown. It’s not a very wide path, so some of the grasses have grown into it. But you can still see the path ahead, so we aren’t night blind. There is enough light from the moon and the stars that we can see the path. So we hike and we get tired and our legs start to get a little bit sore. I say, “Let’s turn around and go back now.” So we do. We navigate exactly backwards. It’s uneventful. Nothing comes after us. There’s no need to run or hasten our pace. We arrive back at the house and I realize that whatever I had in my hand, I left there. So, my child sleeps, but I don’t. I leave the house and I meet someone else at a marina - it’s a complex of houses where people live. I’m meeting some friends there. There are lawn chairs set up in a circle. It’s an uncomfortable baby shower where people sit around in a circle talking stiffly in awkward small talk. There’s some kind of party game going on. One of the people grabs me by the hands and pulls me into the middle of the circle. I’m to stand there and grab the hands of two other people, then we lean back until there’s tension in the arms. Then that’s it. We stand back upright, let go, go back into our chairs. I wait and watch a few other people do the same kind of party trick. Then I’m thinking, “When is this thing going to be over?” One by one, people start to leave. I don’t linger. Then I’m caught by one of the people I know. She says, “Come on, we have to go visit my mom. She’s in one of these houses.” I think, “Okay, I’ll do that.” As we enter into the house, I realize it’s another baby shower of some sort. There are bits of blue decoration - like the tissue paper kind - and blue balloons stuck to the wall. Finger foods have been set out everywhere. The mom stands up when she sees me, but then she tips over to one side. I realize that she’s had way too much to drink. In fact, she seems to have had more to drink than she seems to be aware of. She doesn’t seem to realize she’s staggering and banging into furniture. I feel compassion for her. I also hope she’ll sit down. She does. She still has this loopy unchanging happy smile on her face throughout this. It’s an unwavering expression. The rest of the people aren’t really engaging with each other. I get up and slowly back away out of the room and out the front door. I leave and go back to my house. I’m walking. It’s a fairly long walk and by the time I get there, it’s morning. My child wakes up. There’s this same dried pasta with a piece of chicken still in the pot. It’s in the exact same condition as it was the night before. Now it’s nighttime again. I tell my child that I forgot something on the walk and we need to do it again. Only this time, there’s not that same little bit of adrenaline going through my body where I feel slightly scared. We go through exactly the same steps to go on the walk. It’s dark, it’s at night. I wake up before I retrieve whatever it is that I left there.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I was in school and going to classes every day. I had a big old vehicle that was always clunky to park outside of school but I didn’t care. Sometimes I just left it sideways or whichever way I could.

863,867,,16/06/2020,06/16/2020 00:02,"There is an operation with water dams - underground controlled waters. One of the dams breaks and the water is flooding. Tons of people are getting caught in the rushing water at the dam. Some are being washed away - children and adults of all ages. I can see them caught under the water. I’m among the people trying to fix it. Some of us are sitting at the dam, dropping things into the water. Others are trying to pull up and move metal fixtures and objects to stop the water from rushing. One woman at a control panel sees what’s going on. She strips her shirt off and runs into the water and swims up against the current to try and stop the flow. In another scene, I’m in my backyard. My neighbors are all walking around the grass. The fence has been broken and they’re trying to figure out how to move the pieces around to make a solid fence and container for the lawn again. In another scene, I’m walking up a hill to a mountain village with my son. We are following somebody. We hear a train in the distance. People are trying to stop the train. We are looking for our car. In another scene, we’ve been given a golden retriever puppy. It’s nighttime, but we don’t have a cage for the dog, so we go to a grocery outlet. They are closing up. But we need a dog cage. We end up buying other items. There is one item that goes through and I decide I don’t want it. We ask if we can return it and they say, “No, it’s too late. We’re already past closing.” So we just decide to take it and come back to return it. Outside there are Latino men with blanket rolls setting up to sleep on the sidewalk for the night. Each of them also has what looks like a wolf head. When I look closely, it’s an entire white wolf pelt. They each killed their own wolf and made a protective cover for themselves to keep out the cold at night.",Ana,last_nights_dream
864,1184,,16/06/2020,06/16/2020 00:03,"I’m at work at the grocery store. I’m in the back - the receiving room. There’s tons of product to put out, but it’s time to close and go home. So we’re all working as quick as we can. My coworkers along with the manager I usually close with at night are there. My manager is saying, “Okay, finish this cart, but leave the rest. It’s time to get out. We need to be done.” I think that’s what she says, so I gather up my stuff and go out. But then she's like, “Oh no, we’re not leaving out. We have to put all this away.” There are a bunch of brand new carts out in this open space in the store. They have orange handles and our carts have green handles, so I’m looking at these orange handles and one of my other coworkers who is also a manager says, “Hey, can you clean that one cart right there?” It has all this sticky stuff on it - I don’t know if it’s honey or maple syrup or what. I’m looking at it and am like, “Oh my god, this is going to take forever to clean. I just want to go home.” But they’re like, “We can’t go home until this stuff is put away or cleaned up.” So, I’m scrubbing this and I’m pretty cranky about it. I get it clean. Then I realize later that if I had just stuck the cart in the freezer, that stuff would have frozen and I could have just flaked it off. But I get it cleaned and I roll it to the back. Now everybody is ready to go, but they’re waiting on me because it took me forever to clean that cart. I sit down because I need to change my shoes and take off my apron. They’re all in the room where we clock out. I’m still in the break room, trying to hurry. Suddenly, this pole appears in the receiving room in the back. The coworker who told me to clean all the sticky stuff off the cart is like, “Oh, can you show me some pole stuff? I want to see what it looks like.” So, I get on there and I do some moves. I’m totally impressed with myself because I didn’t know I could do all these moves and they look good. She’s totally impressed. But I still have this in the back of my mind that I need to hurry up and get my stuff and go. But she’s like, “Show me another one.” So I go to do the same moves but on the other side - my drunk side. I’m not as good on the drunk side. I don’t hang onto the pole and I’m falling off. I feel rushed anyway. So I mess it up. I don't fall off the pole, but I get off real quick. She leaves. I go to gather my stuff again because I still don’t have everything because I was on the pole. I’m trying to change my shoes. I get my shoes on. In my head I’m thinking, “Why are you putting these heels on? You’re going to have to get in the car and drive. It’s hard to drive in heels. You should just leave your flats on.” I get my bag. It’s one of those sports bags that have shoes and my lunch and my earrings - I haven’t put my earrings back on. I go to leave and I’m rushed because everybody is waiting on me. We walk out the back door. I’m no longer in town. As soon as I go out the back door, I’m somewhere else. I’m not entirely sure where I am. There’s a train like the sugarcane train that’s in Maui that is open on all sides. I’m like, “Oh I gotta catch this train.” I get on the train. I am still messing with my shoes and I don’t get off at my stop. I’m like, “Oh, well it’s okay, I’ll keep riding the train.” I think maybe I’ll walk home. I don’t know why I decide to stay on the train instead of getting off at my stop. Now the train goes and it’s long past any of my stops. We’re passing a ton of ocean - there’s this large expanse of ocean on my right side. The train is on land still, but all of this ocean passes and suddenly I’m in Lahaina, on Maui. I’m like, “Oh I’m really screwed now. There’s no way for me to get home.” I realize I’ve left my phone at work - at the grocery store. I’m like, “Okay, well maybe i can just get off at this stop and I’ll walk home.” I don’t know how I’m going to walk home. It’s so far for me to get home. So I go to get off the train at this one stop as I hear the conductor say, “Anybody for this street?” The street names are all in Hawaiian. It looks like we’re on Front Street in Lahaina, at least parts of it look like what I remember Front STreet looking like. So I go to get off and then I realize, “Nope, I can’t.” I realize I’ve left that sports travel duffel bag on the train, too. So, the train goes into town and then it starts to reverse a little bit and backs up for a couple of stops. I get off at the stop closest to home, except it’s still miles and miles away. I get off and then I realize I can’t get off and this is silly of me. There’s no way I can get anywhere and I left my bag on the train. So I get back on and go to get my bag. But now I don’t know what to do because the train is going to go forward again. I’m just going to be further away from home than I want to be. But if I get off here, there’s no one for me to call to get me home and I don’t have my phone with me. I think, “Well, my dad lives in Lahaina.” But even then, I can’t call him and I don’t want to be with or near him anyway.",Rose,last_nights_dream
865,1391,,16/06/2020,06/16/2020 00:04,"“The Fortune Teller” I’m in some kind of really small town, like some of the ones at the border between Canada and the US. It’s summer. It’s around the shores of one of the Great Lakes. I don’t think it’s Lake Ontario because it touches the US in a bigger way. It has the flavor of Fort Erie or Crystal Beach or one of those kinds of places. It’s got that carnival kind of American bordertown atmosphere. I’m staying there temporarily - maybe a weekend. I’m with some friends. I can’t identify any of them, except Peggy, my daughter’s boyfriend’s aunt. She’s in the boat that I’m in when we go out for a little bit of water fun on the lake. She’s describing that we have to maneuver ourselves around the ships that are coming in the opposite direction. She gives them some kind of nickname like Shoe Boat. I wonder what she means by that nickname because I’ve never heard that before. One of them actually looks like the shape of a shoe if you use your imagination. There are a lot coming in. The person who’s driving the boat is not me. It’s a motorboat - something I don’t normally choose to be in. The person driving knows how to navigate around the oncoming traffic of all the boats coming in the opposite direction towards the shore. So we get around them and then we have some kind of water sport that we can get in the water and do. I’m hazy on one that is - it’s not water skiing, it’s not floating, I’m not sure what I’m doing. However, we do this for a little bit, get back in the boat, and then are driven back to the little town where we’re staying. I guess I’m in a motel because it’s on the ground. It doesn’t feel like a hotel that goes up. Once I’m back in my room, I gather up laundry. I take the basket, walk up the street up a bit, and then go into this run down little store. It’s dark in there. My eyes adjust to the light -it’s an evening kind of dark, the kind of dark in a building that has really dirty windows or maybe no windows at all. There’s a long bench - the kind that people put against a wall in schools so you can sit down and take your boots off and put them underneath. So it’s a long skinny, maybe only a foot above the ground bench. I’ve set my laundry basket on top of this vertically, because of course the bench is too narrow to set it horizontally. I see that there’s five other laundry baskets in front. Mine is at the end of the bench. The other people who own these other baskets of laundry are sitting around the corner, waiting. I notice Peggy coming out of the door ahead of the bench. Someone leaves. Then one of the other people waiting goes in with her and she also grabs the basket of laundry at the front of the bench. They’ve been waiting for about 15-20 minutes. Then she comes out, puts a load of laundry on the bench that’s unfolded but dried. Another person goes in with her and she grabs another basket of laundry. So she’s doing laundry, just washing and drying it. People are going in with her, but are coming out. Now she’s done about three baskets of laundry and just grabbed a fourth. Each basket of laundry has another person going in with her. Now there are four baskets of laundry that she’s washed and dried, but none of the laundry is folded. Now there are four people that look like they have come together. They were waiting for each other and now that’s complete. So they’re talking to each other about what Peggy gave them while they were in the room and she was doing the laundry. They each have a chart. The chart is some kind of personal chart. She was telling them their life’s purpose. I’m wondering when Peggy learned how to do anything like that.I’m really surprised that she’s doing this. There are only two more baskets of laundry and there’s somebody ahead of me. I don’t notice that she actually takes my basket of laundry first because I don’t go in with her and I haven’t signed up for this predictive type of thing that she’s advertised. I don’t even realize that Peggy was doing the laundry. I was just going to do my own. I overhear another woman. She’s taken the suggestion box that belongs to Peggy and emptied it out. She’s looking at all the post-it notes where people have written comments. Some of them are laughing with exclamation points as though she’s told them something that they don't believe they could do. But they’re laughing like, “Wow! I can’t imagine myself doing this!” Or “I’m so surprised at what she said!” These one line comments are the kind that are on the post-it notes in the suggestion box or comment box. They’re all believing that what she told them is probably true, even though some of them are super incredulous to the point of laughing because it’s something they can never imagine themselves doing, so it’s a surprise/shock laugh. They still aren’t questioning her. Then I look down to the bench and think that I’m going to take my laundry somewhere else. She’s done mine first ahead of someone else who was waiting. It’s a woman I know. I’m feeling bad that Peggy took my basket ahead of hers. The laundry is still warm. So I leave and take it back to my room to fold it. Then the dream repeats itself. I go back to the shore and get in the boat. The same people are in the boat. The same person is navigating through all the ships going the opposite way. We all engage in some kind of water sport, get back in the boat and go back in. There is day 2 of waiting in line for Peggy to tell people what their life’s purpose is. It goes faster this time and there’s not as much waiting. She comes out and shows me that she’s made some money - a couple $100, some fifties, twenties, tens and fives.

867,1185,,17/06/2020,06/17/2020 00:01,"I’m visiting my friend Emma - she’s a psychic, an intuitive. We are sitting down having a conversation but I can’t remember what the conversation is about. The scene changes to this huge outdoor party. It’s all of these schools and students who are graduating. My high school classmates are there. My parents are there, too. We’re at a pool. It’s like the pools at the Hilton Hawaiian - super long and winding with different sections. I am with my parents. They’re here to celebrate - maybe me...but I don’t know who exactly is graduating. I just know that it’s a huge party outdoors at this poolside. We’re riding on little rafts through the pool area. There are famous people who we want to meet. I don’t recognize them and don’t know who they are in this realm, but in the dream they are famous people. I feel like I’ve met them already and had conversations with them. They seemed pretty cool and humble. I wasn’t extremely starstruck or anything. When I meet them in the dream, everything is really chill and there’s no weirdness about them being stars. In other words, there’s no hierarchy. Then my parents show up and my friends show up and are like, “Yeah, we’re going to meet these people!” So we get on this little raft that takes us from one side of the pool to the other, so we’ve crossed some sort of threshold. The famous people are at this one table. My parents are like, “Come here, we’re going to sit here.” We all (me, my parents and some of my classmates) begin to squeeze in close around these famous people. I’m feeling like this is so awkward. My attention is on my friends, siblings and my parents and I’m talking to them instead of the famous people. I don’t want to be fawning over them - it feels gross. Then we’re all sitting at this table. Somebody starts to announce awards and whatnot. The people who are lined up across the pool on the other side are cheering and we’re cheering. There’s a lot of celebrating happening. The party disperses. For whatever reason, I haven’t eaten and a lot of people have not eaten. We’ve been sitting there watching shows. I think food was being served, but I’m not eating - I don’t know if it’s because I just can’t because I’m allergic or what. Everyone disperses for playtime because the award ceremony is over. Everyone is playing in the pool. There are huge waterslides and I go down a waterslide a few times. I’m in a swimsuit. I’m hungry though. The hunger is starting to get intense. And everybody is hungry. There wasn’t enough food. A lot of the parents are gone at this point and there are just a bunch of younger kids playing around. We find these meat sticks - they come in pairs of two and are wrapped in plastic. Everyone is given a meat stick. I go to eat it because I'm ravenous. But I take one bite and my stomach is like, “Oh hell no!” As I’m watching some of the other kids with meat sticks, everybody is chowing down because they’re so hungry. But they’re swimming through the pool and all of the grease from the meat sticks is coming out of the package and now it’s in the pool. I’m standing on the side of the pool with this meat stick I don’t want. I think I give it away at some point. I’m watching other people swim in the water with their meat sticks and making the water greasy. Some of the other people that are with me are kids and I think they’re models because they’re really tall and skinny. I think, “Wow, they’re just going after these meat sticks. They taste kind of gross and I can’t believe they’re eating them. And they’re getting them in the water. I don’t want to get in the water anymore.” But I need to get from one side of the pool to the other. So I’m swimming through this greasy water and it’s grossing me out. No amount of chlorine is going to get this grease off of me. Then the dream shifts. I’m observing and a bit disembodied. I see an AI - a robot. He’s on a planet and his spaceship has crashed. His AI pet is going to run off and has gotten really wild. This AI pet can morph like a transformer. It can be really huge or really tiny. It can be all kinds of things. He’s trying to retain his AI pet, but also trying to fix his spaceship which has crashed on the side of a mountain. The topography is all sand and sand dunes and rocks. There is one episode where he is trying to talk to his AI pet and it’s huge - it has transformed into a huge transformer size. I’m somehow partnered with him and he’s fighting his pet. He’s rolling in the dirt and avoiding being stepped on. At one point I see his AI pet has a metal leg that looks like a chicken leg. They are both made of metal. I see this three or four-toed metal foot come down and try to smash the AI guy. He rolls out of the way. It’s very dramatic, like the scene from a movie. Then somehow the guy scares off his pet for the moment while telling it to behave itself and transform back into something more manageable. So the AI pet runs off down this canyon to go have a timeout and think about what it’s done. There’s a threat of humor throughout this whole part even though it’s very serious because the AI guy is upset that his pet has gotten so out of control. He’s also upset because his aircraft has crashed and he needs to fix it. The AI guy climbs up this rocky cliff face to his craft that’s crashed on this precarious ledge. He goes inside and I watch him. He’s unscrewing the screws around this gigantic pane of glass that has all these etchings that are like a control center. He’s like, “Yep, I’ve got this. I know how to fix this. I just need to take these screws out and the glass is going to fall towards me.” He is in what looks like the cockpit of his craft. You can stand up in it. It’s round with a flat floor. As he takes off the last screw out and the glass falls out and you see it fall. It lands on these tall spires of rock that are below him on the cliff face mountain. The glass cracks and spiders everywhere. In my mind in the dream, I’m laughing because it’s so comical that the glass fell the wrong way and he’s going to have to fix that now. I don’t even know if he can fix it. He’s like, “Yep, I got this.” He says something funny as it falls down. Now I’m thinking, “Oh my god, now you’re really screwed. Then he goes back to fixing other parts of the craft. It’s like I’m seeing a montage of him fixing parts. The montage slows down where he asks for his breakfast and I hand him his breakfast. All I can see is my hand and my hand is human. I hand him a hard boiled egg, but it’s still soft. He cracks it open and I watch him. The outside of the egg is deep red - not like we’re used to. He peels the shell off and cuts it in half with his fingernail. He goes to eat it and it’s soft boiled, so he’s slurping it. I ask him, “How do we win this?” He says, “You have to tip it towards the side of wanting?” In the dream, I’m asking how we are going to get the ship fixed and how he is going to get his AI pet back. But in my mind in this realm, I’m asking how do we stop the racism, how do we stop killing each other, how do we change the paradigm, and how do we get out from under whatever it is that’s trying to feed off our emotions all the time and keep us in fear and keep us fighting each other and keep us in this vibration of discrimination and being against each other and hating each other. I wake up to a song in my head: “I’m ready to match the rhythm to the beat.”",Rose,last_nights_dream
868,1392,,17/06/2020,06/17/2020 00:02,"“Grandpa T” I’m in my maternal grandparents’ house on North Shore Blvd. I seem to spend a lot of time there alone, wandering around from room to room. It’s a really big house. The odd thing is that my grandparents are sleeping in the room I always slept in when I was there and I am sleeping in their room. But this one particular day, I get up in the middle of the night and they’re still sleeping. I walk down the long hallway into the kitchen. I just sit there. There was never a table in the middle of the kitchen in real life, but there is in my dream. I sit down at it. I feel like there is the presence or essence of other people coming in and out of the kitchen. I’m just sitting there feeling into them. I notice the dynamic between them in a way I never did when I was a child in that house. I’m noticing personalities and why they act the way they do. I spend a few hours doing this in the kitchen. Then I get up from the table and go over to see if there is anything on the stove. I make sure all the burners are off. Then I walk down the hallway into the room my grandparents used to sleep in. I get into the bed and lie there for a while awake. As I’m lying there, my consciousness wanders out the sliding patio doors into the grounds that are around the house. I notice that there’s a musty smell I’ve never noticed before. It’s coming from what would have been the east side of the grounds. There’s some soggy area - a bit of marsh - that I’ve also never noticed before. I attribute that to the musty smell. Then my consciousness goes down to the boat house. I feel this mixture of fear at how big it seems to me or that it doesn’t seem big on the outside, but on the inside it yawns back into the ground. There’s this big boat in there that doesn’t seem like it would possibly fit when you look at the boat house from the outside. The discrepancy between what it appears to be on the outside and what it actually houses on the inside is what gives me that little bit of fear. My consciousness comes back around up to the top where there is a greenhouse. I notice that it was barely ever used. There are a few remnants of plant pots and projects that were started and never finished. Then I go over to the sunroom, which is outside, and I sit there. It’s still nighttime. There’s the sense of disuse there as well. I also feel like there’s some leftover bits of gatherings. I think, “Well, at least this got some use.” Then as I’m sending there, I notice my grandfather is beside me, sitting on another chair. He’s complaining about why it takes my grandmother so long to do everything. I lean over and pat him on the arm the way a parent would. I say, “Well, that’s because you’re so picky. If you weren’t so focused on details all the time, she wouldn’t take so much time trying to fulfill them for you.” He sits back in his chair and appears to be thinking about this. He’s considering it. I leave him there and go back into the house. I go through the living room, through the hallway, and down the stairs to the basement. There are a lot of things piled up in there. I consider that they’ve never really gotten rid of the stuff that their own kids left behind when they moved out. I’m thinking and wondering why this is - what sense of something seemed to stop and not move on for them. My feet feel the cold of the floor and notice it’s marble. I think, “Wow, a lot of the materials used in this house are very expensive.” The room has a fireplace at one end. I remember as a kid being allowed to create a fire there but there was no arrangement of chairs around it or of it ever being used by people sitting around the fireplace and just gazing at the fire. I feel a little bit sad at how the basement isn’t a lived in space. It’s more a storage place for memories that aren’t really integrated into life. So I go back up the stairs into the living room. I sit in one of the charis and notice that there is a rectangle in the wall. It looks like it has a little door in it and I’ve never noticed it before. It’s very tiny - probably about 6x4 inches. I open it up and there’s a key inside. I’m sitting there with a key in my hand. I’m thinking, “Why would somebody go to the trouble of disguising this passageway into the inner walls and not lock it and just leave a key in it?” The key has some meaning, and I’m wondering what it is. As I’m sitting in the chair, my grandmother comes and sits beside me. She says to me, “You know one of my favorite things about this chair is?” I say, “What?” She says, “It opens up to a bed.” It’s a single chair. She shows me how you can push it back like a recliner. The part you are leaning on flops out once. The part where your legs are flops out. A person can sleep comfortably there overnight. I say, “Oh, that is a really good idea.” I tell her that my space is very, very small. I indicate from the end table over to one couch. Then I say, “That’s how big my entire living room is.” She says, “Oh, well that couch pulls out into a bed, too. If you had these two pieces of furniture, you could double the size of your space because then you wouldn’t need one of your bedrooms.” I think that’s a really clever idea. Then she walks away down the hall and goes back to the bedroom. I just sit there in the living room. I’m thinking, “How much of my grandmother is there actually in this space?” I wonder if she was ever able to use her brilliant mind that I knew her to have beyond the house. In my dream, I feel some anger directed to my grandfather. It’s like it comes out of my body in a concentrated shot towards him. Then after it does, I feel bad because he’s a nice man. Then he appears beside me in the chair in the living room that my grandmother was sitting in. I can tell from his demeanor that he’s not upset with me at all. He has felt my anger, but it’s not something he’s ever felt against himself at one point. We sit there in companionable silence. I leave him there and go back to the bedroom and get in bed.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

870,1186,,18/06/2020,06/18/2020 00:01,"This dream starts with Dana and I. We’re together and learning about anti-racism. We’re learning from King Noire and his wife, Jet Setting Jasmine. We’re all at a movie theater. They want us to watch a movie as part of our anti-racism education. Their son Majesty is with them. He’s two. Jasmine is breastfeeding him and we’re all watching. I’m uncomfortable. I’m feeling unsure and I don't know what we’re going to watch. These two people are so solid in who they are, what they know and how they show up in the world. I don’t want to harm them in any way or disrespect them in any way, and I’m white. So I’m nervous. We’re watching the movie and Jasmine is nursing the baby. The movie is over and Jasmine gives me Majesty to hold. I'm like, “What do I do with Majesty?! I’m not nursing and I can’t feed him!” I have this feeling that I can’t provide for him or nourish him. But I do know how to hold a baby because I have two kiddos. I take him and I’m nervous. We leave the theater and now Dana and I are just with King and Majesty. We’re now at a convention center. There are multiple rooms with different spaces. Each room has a different conference or panel or presenter. Dana goes off because she is going to learn from somebody. I am still with King and still have Majesty. I hand Majesty to King and he drops him. I’m like, “Oh my god, you just dropped the baby!” I go to pick up the baby and Majesty’s whole body is rigid. His back is arching and his mouth is pulled back in a rictus grin. I’m like, “Oh no!” I’m afraid his back has been broken. King is looking at me like, “What are you going to do?” I’m like, “Uh, you just dropped your baby. What am I going to do?” Then I realize Majesty’s body is going into the typical trauma response from rigidity to shaking it out. So if I just hold him while his body does his thing, he’s going to be okay. So I just hold him and let his body do that. When he’s done, I hand him back to King. The scene shifts a little and I walk into an amphitheatre. I’m going to watch a performance. Everybody in the crowd is dressed to the nines like they’re going to see an opera. In the front row I see Nani, Janet and Shawna who are my three friends from high school that I used to hang out with. I see them and am pretending not to see them because I don't want to talk to them. But they see me and I see them track me. I walk past them and sit. I watch the performance (I don’t remember what it was). The performance ends and I walk out of the theatre. I’m in the lobby now and the lobby looks an awful lot like the lobby of the theatre at the high school I went to. It was called Gates Theatre because that was the last name of the people who donated enough money to build it. The three of them call my name and are like, “Rose! Hi! We see you.” I’m like, “Eh, hi!” But I don’t want to talk. In Junior year of high school, Nani and Janet dropped me from the friend group and Shawna went with another friend group so I was left with no friends in my junior year. In my senior year, Nani moved away, but she sent me a letter apologizing for ostracizing me and leaving me out. I realize this is my hesitation. They always show up in my dreams and I'm like, Eh. They’re like, “How are you?” I look at them and am like, “You know what, I’m great, I’m fine.” I don’t want to do small talk. But Nani wants a hug, so I guess I’ll hug her. Then I get away as quickly as I can. I go sit on a barstool at a tall table. My classmate Ikaika who I've known since second grade cruises by. He does this double take because I don’t look how I used to look and it’s not just age - I’ve had a nose job since my brother broke my nose and I just look different than I did in high school. He’s trying to figure out who it is. I’m like, “Hey Ikaika, it’s Rose.” He goes, “Oh my god!” He’s doing the double take thing and side eye thing that men do when they see an attractive woman. He's like, “You are so beautiful. You are gorgeous.” I’m like, “Yup!” I hug him hello and we do some small talk and then he goes on his way. Then the dream comes back around to King Noire and anti-racism and sex work. Now I’m in a car with King. It’s a Cadillac and the top is down. We’re driving through a city and through some shady neighborhoods. I’m taking everything in. My jaw is dropped. He’s talking to me about sex, anti-racism and social justice. I can’t recall his exact words. He’s teaching and I’m listening. We end up near a river. There’s a shell floaty - like Aphrodite. He’s like, “Okay, now here’s the part of your education aroudn sex.” I’m looking at him like, “What are you talking about?” Oh, I’ve been eating blueberries and they’re so sweet - they’re the most magical delicious blueberries that have ever existed. I climb on the shell and I have the blueberries. I’m wearing a skirt. King offers me the rest of the blueberries: “Take as many as you want because these are the last of them. So I put the blueberries in my lap right over my pussy. I’m eating them and am reclined back in this shell that is now floating down the river. King is like, “Now it’s time for your sex education.” There are so many feelings and thoughts and I’m like, “I don't know what to do!” He leans over me and starts to eat the blueberries out of my lap where I have them nestled in my skirt. I’m like, “Oh hell yes!” When I look up, I realize he’s completely naked and he’s leaning over me from the top. So it’s like yes, his penis is right in my face. I’m like, “Oh! I know what to do with this!” From that point forward, all of my “oh my god I don't know what’s happening” thoughts change to “oh I don’t need to be an expert, I know what to do with what's in front of me.” There’s this beautiful dick hanging in front of my mouth and I am definitely going to suck on that. It’s a knowing. This part ends with us 69’ing in a shell floating down a river in a city by some shady neighborhoods. It’s not a problem! I realize I was just getting in my own way of things I was trying to learn. The whole time King was being very stern and very king-like. There’s a recognition of King and his wife - they are so centered, they know who they are, they know what they’re doing here, they know their worth, they don't fucking question it, they just are king and queen. The whole time I didn’t know if I was worthy. But by the end of the dream, I knew what to do and realized this is very human. What else would you do if I had a lapful of blueberries?!",Rose,last_nights_dream

My husband is nearby on a surfboard. Every now and again a huge shark goes by and it’s making me feel unsettled and frightened. A huge shark goes right under our raft and makes the waves even choppier right around us. Then another huge shark goes right over our raft and slips between the gap between the buckets and logs. I see that it’s bloodied and has a rope tied tightly around its fins. Mia doesn’t seem concerned because even though these sharks are huge, they won’t directly attack us. But then we are actually under attack. Great Whites spot us. Mia says, “Okay Viviane, we’ve gotta dive.” So we lay flat on our stomachs and make the raft plunge down under the waves as you would do with a surfboard. We plunge away from the shark and miss it. But as we rise up, the tip of our raft knocks the underbelly of a huge hammerhead shark. We have to dive again before surfacing and continue diving deep. I hope we don’t run out of air and I hope this tactic protects us from the sharks. My husband is doing the same thing on his surfboard. Somehow we all make it safely out of the water to the station.

It’s a huge barn that has been converted into a boutique with gorgeous gowns hanging up on the walls all the way up to the ceiling. I’m looking for a particular style because the other dress was torn. It’s like an art gallery. I find a similar dress but with more vibrant colors. I ask for help getting it down. The woman who works here is thin and old with dry wrinkled skin. Her eyes are very bright and alive. She seems to know something I don’t know yet. Then she tells me that they have a dream group that meets here every other Tuesday. The man who leads this dream group is so eccentric and people really love him and adore him. I’m a little interested but also wary and doubtful of a man with such charisma and appeal. Then I’m walking down a hall in this big barn which I now realize is a retreat center. I see a sandwich board with an announcement for this dream workshop which happens to be this day later this evening. I then encounter this beautiful man in the hallway and there is something so magnetizing between the two of us. We are immediately drawn together and he’s pressing me against the wall. We are having an ecstatic sexual encounter, even though I’ve never seen him before. Then we smoothe down our clothes and go our individual ways. The old woman from the art dress show has arranged for me to have dinner with this dream teacher. So I go and am surprised to see the elegant dining room within the barn. I’m sitting at a table by myself. I order some food and this woman comes by. I’m loving my food - bread with oil for dipping. The woman pulls the bread out of my hand and starts to eat. I’m fighting her for it and think it’s so beyond that she’s decided to come up and eat my food! We’re having a fight about it and she just doesn’t understand. She wants to sue me not letting her eat my own food. Then the dream teacher’s assistant sits at the other side - I don’t know if they are a man or woman. The man from the hallway comes and sits directly across from me and gives me this smile. I’m like, “Oh my god, that man in the hallway was this dream teacher.” I feel a bit awkward and don’t know what to say. He’s smiling at me in a knowing kind of laughing way and is enjoying my little shock. He introduces himself as if meeting me for the first time. I play along. His assistant kind of knows what’s going on. They order the food for the whole table and seem to know the menu well. The food arrives - noodles, lobster, buttery decadent amazing melt in your mouth meal with the most exquisite wine. My senses are turned on to full ecstasy. We begin talking about dreams. I end up going to the dream group and I can feel why people love him. My whole self is turned on again. I go every week. It seems like every other week we have this amazing sexual experience together and the other weeks he’s just focused on teaching and being there for all the students. I accept that this is the education and experience. Our relationship is amazing. There are no emotional obligations or expectations. Each class, the chairs are adjusted.

She’s wearing a teeny tiny zebra print bikini bottoms. She’s leaning over in a provocative way then arching her back across the back of the chair revealing her beautiful sexy body and trying to catch his attention. I feel unhappy and insecure.

I go to a house on campus to gather supplies. Someone tells me they’re on their way because they have been tracking me by my phone’s GPS so they know where I am. They are waiting outside. I walk out and there are three men walking straight towards me and pointing at me. There’s no way I can run, so I allow them to take me. I feel defeated. I am dropped down to the bottom of the sea.",Ana,last_nights_dream1

But where is my daughter?” I don’t think she was with me at first, but I knew she was there on the beach or something. So I’m looking for my daughter and I can’t find her. I’m freaking out.

884,1187,,22/06/2020,06/22/2020 00:05,"I’m going to see my lover. He’s working out in the forest. There’s a complex of a bunch of buildings where he’s working with a bunch of his buddies. One building is a dorm. There’s another building where they eat. I have work to do, too. I’m out there and thinking I’ll do this work with him. He’s really not happy to see me. He’s really pissed off that I’m in his space. I’m pouring moon blood into containers that look like Monday-Friday pill containers. Instead of just seven compartments, there’s a whole sheet of them, so there’s probably 24 compartments, maybe 36. I have three sheets of them. My moon blood is in a jar where I’ve collected it and I’m just pouring it into each of these sheets and trying to make it an even amount in each. There’s a presence of my son, but he’s not actually there. My lover has stopped whatever work he was doing and he’s upset. He’s like, “I told you I needed space. Why are you here? Don’t come out here.” I say, “Well I’m actually here to do work.” He says, “Don’t lie to me. I know you’re here to see me.” I’m feeling hurt and confused. I’m not really sure why I’m out there except I am happy to see him. He leaves the area and takes me with him, but he’s not happy about it. I’m not happy about it now either, because he’s being a bit of a dick. He’s asking me all kinds of questions like, “What are you doing out here? What is your job? Why are you out here? What are your long term goals?” He’s asking all these questions that I don’t have answers for and it feels like an attack. It doesn’t feel kind. Then other stuff happens that I can’t remember. In the last scene, I’m with a client of mine who is getting married. It’s the day of the wedding and I’m there as an officiant. I’m also there to set up the wedding. It’s the second time she’s trying to get married. The first time everything got shut down because of coronavirus. A lot of the supplies we need for getting read are not there. I’m trying to make these burlap pumpkins as part of the decor. I’m just making do with what I’ve got because I can’t find some of the supplies I used last time when I was getting everything ready for the wedding, but it didn’t happen. This time I’m trying to do my best with what I’ve got. My client is really excited. She’s trying on her wedding dress. She’s showing it to me. We’re in this room that’s part of a bigger hall where she’s getting married. Her bridesmaids are there and there are other people. It’s going to work even though it got canceled once and we don’t have all the supplies we had last night. We’re still making the wedding work and she still looks beautiful.

885,1393,,22/06/2020,06/22/2020 00:06,"“The Inner City” In this dream, I am in a really busy crowded urban setting. It’s really hot. There’s not much space between people. I can feel a hive of activity. Everyone is busy with something. Suddenly, I’m inside a building. It’s quite steamy. There are people washing dishes. The dishes are really big. There are parts and pieces of machines that have been used to process food. I don't know what the parts assemble to as a whole. I feel curious about this as I’m helping people. I don’t know the people I’m working with. So I’m helping carry the pieces in and setting them on something that looks like a conveyor belt. I notice this one piece. It’s really oddly shaped. It’s about 2 feet wide and 2 feet high. It’s covered with sticky potato. I think it’s been used to make mashed potatoes. But the potato is all stuck to it. Then there’s this big hose thing that’s suspended from the ceiling. It’s kind of springy. I squeeze the trigger and the water comes out at a very high pressure. I’m trying to get the water out of this. At one point there’s a sieve thing on it. I’m trying to get it out of there before it goes into the conveyor belt and into the dishwasher. Other people around me and they’re moving really fast. They’re doing this same thing and wash everything. A woman comes in. She’s got a clipboard. She has a pinched face and is very disapproving-looking. She practically gets in the way with her criticism of what everyone is doing. I can feel her gaze on me as I’m helping. I feel like she’s centered me out as though I’m not supposed to be there and my skill level isn’t up to par. It’s a whole demeanor like, “I’m going to watch you even closer.” She’s making me nervous now. I don’t know if I’m standing on the right side of the conveyor belt because of her disapproval. So I finish what I’m doing. I notice the other people around me are also moving extra quickly when she comes in the room. They’re trying to speed up and they’re trying to stay out of the way of her gaze. I notice that the woman is white and I can’t tell the race of the people around me. Their features are such a mix of different things. After this giant machine that seems to be used for mashing potatoes is finished getting washed, I leave that area. There’s a ramp and there’s quite a labyrinth of rooms that go to different places. I just am trying to see where the flow of traffic of people is going back and forth. I want to stay in the line of busyness. There are people trying to make different drinks like mochachino (which I’ve never tasted). I stay away from that because I don’t know how it’s supposed to turn out. Then there are different teas. I start to assemble some of those. I’m putting them on a ledge ready for other people to come and take them. The work slows down. There isn't really anything else to do. So I take one of the other hallways which are made of painted cement. I follow them around a few turns until I come out into a bigger room that is somewhat like an auditorium. People are lying down on yoga mats. I don’t have a mat, so I just crouch down. I notice the floor has indoor/outdoor carpeting. I’m just lying on the floor. The teacher has a bag of really oddly shaped rocks. They’re all different sizes and shapes. Some are big, some are small. Some are painted, some aren’t. She’s laying them down on top of a person who is lying on their stomach. She starts at the end of the spine and goes upwards towards the shoulders. She’s put a small rock on the middle of the coccyx and a bigger rock in the lumbar spot and there’s an odd pattern going up the rest of the spine. I think, “Why didn’t she put the bigger rock that’s spade shaped on the coccyx, then work her way up using the natural shape of the body to fit the stones on instead of putting a really heavy one on the lumbar spine?” Now I notice that she’s teaching someone else to do it this way. Now she’s asked the person that was lying on the floor to sit up and bring herself into gomukhasana, but lie on one of her thighs. She’s calling the thigh bone a “femoris” but in a sing-song type voice. I’m thinking, “Uh, no!” But the person that is being worked on is listening to her and trying to follow these instructions. So I leave the room. I go up a hallway and down another one of these painted cement labyrinths. I end up in a public washroom. People are talking about other people. It must be a Grade 8 middle school washroom. One of the people that the two girls in front of the people are talking about comes out of the washroom. I think, “I wonder if they knew she was in there?” I kind of glare at them. Then I leave the washroom at the same time as the girl who was in it. She goes back into the room where the people are doing yoga and lies down on a mat. Now I suddenly have a mat in my hands and I put it down beside her. We’re lying face down with our hands under our foreheads. There’s another set of instructions. The hot stone lady has disappeared. There begins a regular yoga practice where we’re instructed to sit back into child’s pose and then step forward into a supported lunge. It’s more free flowing and everybody is doing it differently and exploring the postures in a slow mindful way so we feel like we are stretching - at least I feel like I’m stretching and there’s permission to move as needed. I can feel that there's less pressure and less expectation to follow complex instructions that don’t make any sense where the people are puzzled and struggling to just follow along. The class speeds up. I’m rolling up my mat and leaving. I go down another hallway and end up in a room where I’m sitting on painted bricks. I put my rolled up mat underneath myself and am sitting on it, so I’m cushioned a bit. I suddenly have two screens in my hand. I’m teaching people how to combine elements to make some kind of vehicle. The way they are receiving the elements makes it so everyone’s vehicle turns out differently. I just feel really light. That movement of creative flow that goes with your body when you feel buoyant. I notice there are colors on the screen when people complete their activity. I’m starting to see light yellow, indigo, pink and green.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

888,1394,,23/06/2020,06/23/2020 00:02,"“Twisting by the Pool” I am going to a public swimming pool that has adult swim lengths. This is odd because I can't swim. In the dream, I am going to the adult swim lengths and the complex with the pool is located in a shopping mall. I swim my lengths and nobody else is there - it’s a private pool. Then afterwards, I shower at the pool. I put on something that I've brought with me that keeps your body warm and it’s very soft. The colors are neutral - grey. As I’m walking through the mall, my feet are cold because I’m wearing those shower shoes that are like flip flops. I notice in a store window a pair of shoes that are a bright indigo blue and they look really warm. They have a faux sheepskin lining and soft pleather or suede on the outside. They look like a moccasin. Suddenly, they’re on my feet. I look down and think, “Oh, my feet feel so much better now.” As I continue to walk through the mall, the stores are all closed and there are no people around. I notice the restaurant where I used to work and think maybe I’ll stop in and see if I know anyone. So I walk into the restaurant. It’s not open and there are no customers or staff yet. I walk to the back and there’s a little place you can stand in front of the kitchen and behind where the customers can see. It’s a place where the staff stand and wait for the food to come out through the window. I’m just standing there. Then the owner comes out and he’s busy carrying some things. He has dishes in his hands and is stacking them up getting things ready for the day. He tells me to stand still. So I stand in between these two walls - one is to the kitchen and one is where the staff wait. He takes me by the wrists and he starts to spin me around in a circle. I look at him and am puzzled and say, “What are you doing?” He says, “Just trust me.” So he spins me around really quickly. I can feel the centripetal gravity pushing me away but he does have me by the wrists. Then there’s this moment where I can either fight it and try to slow down and pull my body towards the center or I can let go and just trust that it will be fine. I let go and I feel something that was hardwired tight in the middle of me snap. There are a few more moments of going around and around and he says, “There, you’ve got it now.” He slows down. He must know I’m dizzy because I have no equilibrium, no balance. He tells me, “Just put your head down for a minute.” I bend my knees and come into a child’s pose with my forehead on the ground. I’m just allowing everything to spin. I feel weightless. There’s some kind of different energy running through my body. I feel the dizziness pass enough that I think it’s okay to stand up and I do. I am looking around. I can see the staff are in the restaurant now and they’re all busy at their own stations setting up and preparing for the day. Then I’m really self conscious and notice what I’m wearing. I think it looks like pajamas and slippers. I don’t want anybody to see me. So I’m waiting until nobody is standing by the side door to exit out of there. This couple comes up and it’s not clear what the woman wants, but she’s asking me for help. I’m thinking I should just spin her around so that she’s not worried about it anymore. I feel like there’s a moment when I tried that, but she’s too frail. So I tell her we should go out for a walk. They come with me. All of a sudden the owner is also there on the walk, although I don’t remember inviting him and I don’t know why he's there. I look down at my feet and legs. There’s a thick layer of snow on the ground and I think I’m going to freeze. Then all of a sudden I’m wearing the winter coat that I used to wear when I was pregnant, so it’s big. I’m not cold anymore. I look over at the woman and now she’s improperly dressed and her teeth are chattering and her skin is turning blue. I think she’s got hypothermia. I tell her to come over and say, “We need to go back and you need to get inside this coat with me.” She says, “There’s no way I’ll fit in there.” I say, “Yes you will. I wore this coat when I was pregnant. There’s definitely room for two people.” So I tell her to get in the coat and I put her arms in the same sleeves as my arms. Now I’ve got boots on and I tell her to step on top of my feet. She’s wooden though. I tell her, “Look, listen to this rhythm. 1, 2, 1, 2. Move your legs at the same time: 1, 2, 1, 2.” She starts to get it. Now I can hear music playing and I say, “Oh! Do you know this song?” I think she might because it’s an older song. As I’m saying that, I realize there was old music that I don’t know but my parents would know playing in the background the whole time, but I didn't really notice. I wonder if they noticed. I look over at the owner and I say, “Hey, you probably know this song.” He listens for a moment and says, “No. What is it?” I tell him that it’s, “Twisting by the Pool” by Dire Straits. The music gets a little louder as though it warmed up to me recognizing it. I say, “Look, move to the rhythm of the music, 1, 2, 1, 2, twisting by the pool!” Now I’m singing it to her and I can feel her relaxing as she thaws out. She starts walking to the rhythm of the music and we’re okay. Now we’re trudging through the snow. The owner has a briefcase now and he starts picking up papers that are all over the snow. He’s putting the papers in his briefcase. He’s hurrying and trying to rush everyone into the store. I say, “it’s okay, I’ve got this. We’ll catch up with you later.” He says, “Good, because they’re supposed to be meeting me for dinner at my house and there’s wine.” The wine is really important. Now I’m feeling confused because I thought I was taking them back to the restaurant. He gives me the address and says, “You need to bring them there. This is my house.” Now I’m feeling uncomfortable again. I don’t really want to go to his house, but I have this woman I have to take there and I’m still wearing what I feel looks like pajamas. Now the dream starts to break down a bit. I’m intending to take them to his house and think I’ll end up going there.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

891,1395,,24/06/2020,06/24/2020 00:02,"“The Kingdom” I arrive. The road here was bumpy. I step out and walk in through a stone archway into an open area. I am greeted by a few people I appear to know already. They’re telling me some news and saying that the king has been very sad lately and is not doing well at all. They haven’t seen him in a little while, but he’s still there. We go through the open stone area - it’s a large room made of stone. We go out a side opening. Everything is very rocky and I realize this whole structure is built on the side of an escarpment. It’s built into the rock that’s part of the escarpment. I walk downhill over this rocky dry land. I come to a lower area. There are some more people, maybe 3 or 4. I think they’re fishing. Some people are standing in the water up to their thighs. I don’t really understand the clothing. Some have rolled their clothing up to the top of their thighs. Others are wearing muslin over top and it’s getting wet in the water but no one seems to care. I go in the water and roll my dress up and tuck it in. I can feel the skin on my legs and the coolness of the water. I can feel the rocks under my feet and some of them are a bit slippery and some are a bit sharp. I have to go in the water very, very carefully. I’m only standing in the water for a few minutes when a young man comes towards me. He seems to have some kind of authority. I also know him really well. We converse for a little bit. He tells me of some of the problems. He tells me there’s been some changes and deaths. Basically, I gather that everything is still intact. At this point I realize there’s another property. There’s a road that goes from the property we have, down into where the rocks descend in altitude and then ascend again to this other property. Everyone calls this other property a castle. But no one has been there for a really long time because the king hasn’t wanted to go there. The reason there’s activity right now is that he’s decided that he’s going to open it up again, so there’s preparations and excitement in the air. At this point, the conversation is that the king is coming down or getting up - I’m not sure which one. There’s another young man who is older than my friend. People are calling him the prince. I see the King and he has painted his skin with woad. He’s been doing this for a long time. People are saying it’s because of his grief. The woad painting is part of this culture and it’s not unusual to anyone. We ascend back up the rocky part I had just climbed down. Now my friend - the younger prince - is holding my elbow because now I’m wet and barefoot. We go back into the original opening in the rock that I arrived into. Now the king comes in this same opening. I see that his face is lined more with a lot more wrinkles. The woad is covering some of the wrinkles. He’s also used some kind of black powder to create upward sweeps between his brows to his brow line and from his bottom lip down through the center of his chin. It’s making him look angrier and more expressive of that emotion. I can see underneath all this paint to the face I have known before. Everything is made out of this rock from the land. There’s a rock inside here that we use as a seat. We sit. He starts talking to me. He feels like a fatherly figure but I get the impression that he is not my father. He sits down and tells me that we’re going to be opening the other part today and he’s ready to finally face this challenge. He’s also looking forward to it because it’s reuniting everyone in his kingdom. It’s difficult to get to, though. The road is overgrown. He indicates that there’s been a zipline installed at the top of this open window carved into the rock. Everyone is going to have to zipline down to the other castle. I agree and say, “This is fine, I can do that.” My friend tells me he appreciates me being there. At this point, two men in suits enter in through the opening. They’re smiling. The king stands up and greets them. They tell him that they have some good news for him. They start talking, telling him that someone wants to give him some money for a piece of the road. They say, “We’ve got it all written up on this contract. It will all be very friendly. You’ll get all this money and it’s just for this one section of road that goes from this piece of land to the castle.” I can feel myself getting really angry inside. I look over at the king and he seems to be considering it, which makes me even more angry. All of a sudden I stand up and yell at them: “How dare you come in here with your lies! You tell him that this will be okay. I know you’re going to trick him. You’re going to get him to sell that and then he won’t have any access to his home. You’re trying to force him through this treachery to sell his own home.” Now they’re really angry. The king says, “Yes, I’m not going to do that.” He yells at them and tells them to get out. They pack up their papers and leave. Nobody says anything to me about my outburst. The preparations continue. Each person is holding one thing. Suddenly I look down and see if I have some kind of tray. There are a whole bunch of things on it, but I don’t know what they are. My mind thinks: “How are they going to stay on while on a zipline? Aren’t they going to fly off?” We start going towards the opening. The oldest son takes the zipline first. You can’t even see him at first - he goes way down and then he goes up and through the trees. I think it looks like he made it. My conscious mind is thinking this looks more like a T-bar from a ski hill. Another one arrives but I let it go past just in case the older one slows down when he goes up the last ascension. Then I put the tray on this next one. As I watch it go on the zipline, nothing slides off. I think, “Hmm.” Then I take the next one. I grab on, sit on the T-bar part and zipline down. Unfortunately, that’s when I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I have other obligations during the day, so I can't go. I could have gone to this first class, but don’t. I putter around my day. There is a woman that I knew from elementary school. She has rigged the elections to be something like a homecoming queen. There are quite a few obligations and functions she’s participating in to raise funds for the school. She’s doing a great job and has the perfect southern smile and hospitality, but she wasn’t actually fairly elected. The administration realizes it and are debating whether to remove her or keep her because she is doing her job so well and has raised so much money.",Ana,last_nights_dream

I’m in a town and the only reason I go there is to teach at the Yoga Studio. This is the real life part of this dream. There are street vendors outside of the Yoga Studio door. The street is really long. There are all kinds of stores and vendors. I stop after walking a long time. I’m standing in front of one of the stores and it’s some kind of curio shop. I talk to three vendors and I’m not sure if they all own the store or if one of them is friends with the people who own it and they’re just sitting together and chatting. I chat with them for a bit then enter the store. The store is dark and dusty. It’s like there is a window somewhere because the lighting is natural, but it’s as though the light is coming through a really dirty window. So it’s dim inside, but I know there isn’t an artificial fluorescent source of light. There are so many things inside and they are stacked in front of the window, so it’s hard to see. I stand and wait until my eyes adjust a little bit. I’m trying to see what are all these things. I can’t really identify anything. They are objects, possibly books, a combination of both. Nothing really stands out as a single object or book. I walk around the store. There’s a part of me that likes that musty smell of history. Even though I can’t discern what the things are, I actually like being in this store. I’m not there to buy anything. I’m simply curious. I stay in there for a bit. There’s a feeling of comfort. Eventually, I exit the store. I’m standing out on the street again. I see some people I know who I have taught at the Yoga Studio. They’re heading towards the studio. I’m thinking to myself: “Oh, was I supposed to teach?” I didn’t realize the studio had reopened. I enter the studio and people are leaving as though a class has just finished. I’m noticing that some of them have showered. I think to myself: “I didn’t realize we had a shower either.” It’s crossing my mind that so much has changed since I taught there. I’m remembering that I’ve been here before in a dream, but I was locked out. I’m feeling this time that I’m glad I’m not. I have a few conversations with people there - one at the desk, one with someone who is just leaving, and another I can’t remember. I exit the studio and go back to the street.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

They are actually of all different economic classes and genders. They’re returning from a long trip or in the midst of a big move. At one point, I’m with a small group of friends who I don’t know from waking life. One is transmasculine (the night before, I watched a documentary about transexuals in Hollywood). This woman comes up to my friend and is really loud and so proud of herself for thinking she knows anything about him. She says, “Oh my gosh, it’s so good to see you sister!” That really upsets him - not in an angry way, but in a sad way. He gets quiet and leaves. I have to talk with her about it and tell her, “No, we call him brother, even those of us who know about his transition.” She kind of understands. The hotel has an annex of some sort - not a gift shop, but an upscale Ikea type furniture store with all kinds of household items. I’m walking around looking for things to replace the things that were old and rusted from the trip here. I lose my wallet after setting it down somewhere and walk away. I’m starting to panic. After some time of looking, someone comes up to me and asks: “Is this yours?” I say, “Yes, thank goodness. It’s mine.” In another part of the dream, I have to move out of the hotel room where I’ve stashed all my stuff including my cat. It’s a blue cat. I have to go somewhere else because the room is too expensive and too nice for all my crap. A man comes to help me. I’m going to stay with his cousin. He’s a black man. I go to the room and show him my stuff. He’s disgusted by the state of things, especially one table with a microwave that is dirty, rusted and splattered with old food. It looks as if there could be varmints inside, too. He says, “No, my cousin won’t let you have this in his home. No way.” We’re trying to figure out what to do with it - just throw it away or if I need it moving forward. We go into the back room to get the cat. The cat runs out and attacks us on its way out There are two other animals - maybe cats. We have to find my cat.",Ana,last_nights_dream
901,1189,,27/06/2020,06/27/2020 00:02,"I’m with my brother, sister and son whois 4 or 5 in this dream. We’re on a rooftop of a building. The building is a college. I have my son in multiple pairs of pants. He’s old enough to get dressed himself and he comes out wearing this. Even though he seems to be younger, he’s also 9 - his age is ambiguous. My brother is young and looks as though he did in high school. My sister also looks younger, like how she did in high school. There’s a break in college and we’ve all met up between classes and have gone out onto this rooftop. You can see this black wall of clouds off in the distance. They are turning greenish and as I’m watching, they form a funnel and there’s a tornado heading our direction. I’m yelling at my son to go in the door we came out of onto this rooftop. There’s also a set of fire escape stairs. My brother is over there. My brother and sister were excited about the parties they were going to go to. They are totally doing the college thing. But I’m thinking I’m too old for this shit and I don’t drink - it’s not my thing - plus I have this little one to take care of. So I see this funnel and am yelling at my brother and sister to look and be careful. I’m also yelling at my son to run back in the door inside where he’ll be safe. My son goes inside and is panicked. My brother and sister do not believe me and just stay out there. I watch through this thick glass window. As the storm tornado goes by, this woman appears and she’s sitting in a chair. The chair is small and wooden with two slots across the back. It’s like she was the tornado or was in the tornado. She’s telling my siblings what to do. So instead of the tornado sucking them up and carrying them off, she’s telling them to go jump off the edge of the roof. She’s saying, “You’re going to die either way, but I’m telling you that instead of sucking you up, you’re just going to jump off.” I’m horrified. I want my siblings! But I also want to protect my son. I know at any point, if she turns around and sees us or especially sees my son, she’ll kill us, too. So I’m not being gentle with my son at all. I’m being really rough and have grabbed him by his shirt. I’m shoving him down because there’s a dresser between us and the window. The woman is on the other side. All I can see is the back of her and she’s sitting in the chair. Her hair is dark and is up in a bun. I can’t see much else. So I’m shoving my son down so she can’t see him. The dresser is between them. He keeps trying to pop up to see her, and I very roughly shove his body back down. I’m yelling at him to stay down so she can’t see him. I see my brother and sister disappear. She disappears and the funnel dissipates even though the clouds dissipate. I tell my son to stay and I go out the door to look. Of course there is no sign of my brother and sister anywhere. My son is distraught. He’s screaming and crying and so mad at me for being rough at him and so upset about his aunt and uncle leaving. He regresses into a younger child, from 9 to 3. I feel horrible because I was so physically rough with him and verbally unkind in trying to keep him hidden. I think I just traumatized him in so many ways.",Rose,last_nights_dream
902,1397,,27/06/2020,06/27/2020 00:03,"“Keep it Small” There’s some kind of outdoor grouping. There’s a bunch of small groups and in makeshift tents that vendors put up. There are a whole bunch of these scattered about a piece of land. There are a lot of people. I’m not there to particularly attend. It’s a program of events going on. Each tent has something else going on in it. I seem to be doing my own thing. As I’m walking down the middle of all these tents, I see one with a person leading a discussion. I see one of my son’s friend’s moms, Melissa. She’s Noah’s mom. She’s sitting and listening, attending one of these discussions. I go in and sit down. The leader of the discussion is telling people that shows of emotion are problematic and that people who do this are making social issues seem worse than they actually are, even small things like using two exclamation marks and spamming emojis contribute to this exaggeration of emotion. The lecturer is pointing how this is bringing the whole of society down. And then the lecturer points out: “Here are ways you can change your overly emotional behavior and start to tone it down, keep it small, don’t react.” The lecturer doesn’t actually have a gender, they are androgenous. They say, “And this is how you can keep it out of your face.” I look over at Melissa and I notice that her face looks so much more serious, and she normally looks very expressive and happy. The lecture is over now. I linger waiting to speak with her. Of course she sees me, but doesn’t react and walk over. So I go over and sit with her. I’m asking her: “Are you buying into this? What do you think?” She says, “Oh, I’ve been doing this for some time now.” She shows me a couple examples of her recent writing. Then she tells me that she is also practicing it in terms of celibacy. She hasn’t had any “action” in quite a few months. I say, “Well, maybe that’s making it easier to be less emotional and less expressive, but when you do have intimacy and share with someone again, you’re going to have an outpouring of emotions into your body. That’s a good thing!” I’m trying to argue that there are times when emotions fill your body and you feel more alive and expressive, and other times when they flatline, but sticking with one extreme is the problem, not the fact that you have emotions. She’s disagreeing with me and reiterating what the lecturer said. So I’m thinking, “Oh no, this is not good.” I feel this outpouring of compassion and wonder if other people are buying into this and just at a low point in their life where there isn’t anything to be outrageously happy about. I’m also thinking that the lecturer did have a point and that’s why so many people are believing this. Melissa is a very intelligent woman. I think there has to be a grain of truth, or they wouldn’t be able to pull so many people into this. It’s the fact that mass mania can get carried away with violence and that does hurt people. But it’s not emotions, but unconscious engagement with emotions and harmful actions. So now people that have been hurt are vulnerable to thinking that emotions themselves are wrong. I’m pondering this as I get up and start walking back through this alley of tents. Suddenly I’m at home. I’m in the living room. The living room is a mess and the furniture is all over the place. I start to straighten it, but I want to put it in a different arrangement and am trying to figure out how I can still have different areas for quiet, eating, and reading, but not in the same arrangement as before. But the shape of my living room is really odd and it’s hard to get furniture in with any sense of feng shui or flow. So as I’m pondering this and moving pieces around, I notice there are clothes strewn around. I’m picking them all up and putting them in a basket and taking them downstairs to sort out for a load of laundry. I have some delicate stuff in one load that is lighter, and saving the load of colors and towels and jeans that can take more agitation in another pile. Then I decide that instead of having two loads with lighter colors and darker colors, I’m really going to sort it according to delicate and able to withstand agitation. So, at the last minute, I throw a bunch of things in with the white delicates. I’ve got orange and blue in there now. I’m not concerned that the colors are going to run. I turn the temperature down and start the load of laundry.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

The ceiling in their house was really really low, and that’s another theme I’ve noticed lately too like I’m too tall for all of the structure; and then the man that arrived was there for me. He was there to pursue me. I liked his energy but could not see his face. I didn’t feel ready for any kind of dating stuff and wish it wasn’t put on me like this. (None of this is happening in real life, so far from a thought given current medical stuff). I go downstairs and my dog Pinto is there and there is a black and white cat playing hide and seek with him. At first it is cute and then the cat starts to hold him down and he is struggling and I am screaming her off and they are all laughing like it’s not serious but it is; they told me to just let the cat play with him and I said, “NO he is not to be played with.” I was so protective and angry.

My birthday is also John the Baptist’s birthday, so it’s like the dark and the light twin.

We sell lights - beautifully made unique chandeliers and light fixtures. There is also art on the wall. I work for an older woman in her fifties or early sixties. One of my duties is to clean up. The shop looks kind of dusty and the lights haven’t been cleaned in a while. There’s a lot of clutter everywhere on the counters and whatnot. Some of the clutter is mine that I’ve just left around. There’s a pair of jeans and a wet towel on the countertop. It’s just really messy. The relationship I have with this lady is familiar but not healthy. This asian man walks in and wants to buy a chandelier. He picks out one that has panes of green glass - the glass is cut into rectangles and squares. The woman is selling it specifically to him - it’s not like he has just wandered in. He has to decorate his elderly parents’ flat. He needs lights no matter what and is very consciously picking out the lights with the green tones. He thinks that his parents will like it. To him, it also has significance around healing and keeping them healthy. The owner of the shop is wrapping it up for him. I was in the back cleaning up the towel and that weird pair of jeans. There’s another chandelier that I was looking at earlier and showing the shop owner. It’s a longer chandelier - maybe five feet long - with thick brass or gold round tubes that hang down from the top where the light is. It also has a cascade of glass panels like the other one, but the panels are not blue and green, they are the colors of a pastel rainbow. I say something like, “This is our unicorn chandelier.” I put it down while I was cleaning. It needed to be cleaned and it was definitely one of our more expensive pieces. While this asian man is being run up by the shop owner, I give him a tour of some of the other chandeliers. I get this hit that he needs another light. I show him this one chandelier and he’s gobsmacked in total awe. He doesn’t even ask the price. He doesn’t need me to tell him about it. He just knows that it’s his. I’m like, “Yes, of course. This is a beautiful piece of art and the healing properties within this one are even more than the one you’re buying.” So he takes it to the front to be run up as well. In the meantime, I’ve cleared out all of the junk from the shop, including all these wet towels that were on the countertops. If you look at the countertops, you can see the outline where the wet towels were. But now they’re gone. The chandeliers and art are no longer dusty. The dream ends with him taking the chandeliers, very pleased knowing that he’s going to put this light in his parents’ flat and they’re going to be so grateful. It feels like the relationship between me and the shop owner has improved now that things are cleaned and I upsold the chandelier to the Asian man.

There’s another family member, but I can’t recall. A friend of mine, Arizona is lying across the top of the couch, the way a cat would. I notice that he was leaning on the back of the couch when I was talking with my dad. Then he put one leg up, then the other and stretched out listening. I don’t mind that he's there. I think it’s odd at first, but then I get used to it. The conversation with my dad ends and the other people who are sitting around start to get up and are leaving in various directions. There's a room that is currently dark. I can see the doorway and it’s open. It leads off the parlor to somewhere else. I’ve noticed it the whole time I was having a conversation with my dad, but don’t know what it’s for. I’m going to look to see what’s in there. As I’m walking across the room, I notice two friends who used to be neighbors and who I haven’t seen in a very long time, cross the room and greet me. A conversation is exchanged, like what have you been up to, how old are your kids...just small talk. They continue on their way. As I’m about to see what’s in the dark room, Arizona is beside me and says, “Hmm, do you mind if I go in there with you?” I say, “No. I don’t know what it is though.” I cross the threshold of the doorway and stand there for a moment as my eyes get used to the light. I see that it’s a big empty room - there’s no furniture and it’s just empty. It’s quite big. Then Arizona asks me if I want to dance. I say, yes. We start dancing. It’s a partner dance - not slow like a waltz. Some time seems to elapse. We exit out of the room, go back through the parlor, sit back down on the couch, and then he asks me if I would like to go out with him. I say, yes. Again, dreamtime elapses and moves forward. We’re sitting in the parlor again. He just looks at me and says, “So, don't you think it’s about time we tell people we’re dating?” I say, “Yes!” as though this is some kind of surprise that I’ve kept it a secret or just not announced it.

I’m here with some people - a woman who is a little shorter than me with longer brown hair. Her vibe is the vibe of my ex and I’m not liking her. She seems to be doing stuff that makes no sense. She buys a charcoal grill that is red, brand new and shiny and clean. I turn to her and say, “We actually have a charcoal grill at home that looks exactly like that, but it’s black. Why are you buying a new one?” She’s not computing that we don’t need another one. She’s just in it for the thrill of buying, I think. I just don’t understand why she can’t understand that we don’t need another one. Then, the other person I’m with is a man. He’s buying a truck - a huge black truck.

He says, “Everyone has to keep their treadmill at six.” I’m struggling to keep it at six and last for 15 or 30 seconds. I’m like, “This isn’t for me.” This is not my norm - normally I would just push until I won. I just didn’t. I’m like, “Yeah, you all go ahead do this. I’m not interested.“ I get off the treadmill. Then I wonder where my kids are. This couple I was with reminds me of my ex and maybe his girlfriend. I’m really concerned.

I’ve driven down Kent St and have turned left onto William, then turn right on Russell, left on Lindsey St, left on Kent and right on William. Then I turn the car around so I’m traveling back up William to Kent St. I turn left on Kent, left on Lindsey St and then go behind the stores to a little parking lot and leave my car there. Now I’m on foot and I have both of my kids. I walk back through the same route. As I’m going past a building on William St, I tell my kids that it used to be an old hotel that dates back to the time of the Orangemen and the structure of it at the very bottom is based in intolerance and hate and that I believe it has influenced every other business that has been built on top of it since the late 1800s. A man is listening or he just overhears and argues. He says, “There was nothing there before the 1970s. I tell him, “No, that’s incorrect. I worked here for a very short period of time a long, long time ago. I’ve seen those exact roots.” When I’m saying “roots” I’m picturing old brick at the bottom that I’ve seen with my own eyes. He contradicts me and says that isn’t so. I just walk away because I know there’s no point arguing with somebody who doesn’t know anything and who’s like that. He sits down at this patio table with two of his friends and the server brings out three burgers and they all have a different kind of topping and they all have a different name. She names them as she lays them down on the table. I look and see they are all just burgers. We continue on foot around the route I already described. When we get to the back of the storefronts where I parked the car, I ask my kids if they’re hungry because we’ve been walking around and it’s quite hot out. They say they do. I take them to this tiny place up the street that serves fish and chips. Then, the dream shifts. I’m making up something I call “Survival Juice.” I’ve got these big glass carboys (jugs). I’m putting a lot of roots into them - some I chop first and some I just stuff down through the hole at the top. It’s a cloudy light beige color liquid. I simply describe it as “Survival Juice” - it’s a medicinal mixture I’ve made that is going to help us get through what we’re going through right now. I hand out a cup of it to each of my kids as well as the people at the restaurant.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

Two were too round. The third one is life-like. I see it with sand roses, then I see it lined with blue beer cans. Then I see it standing on its back fins on top of one of the other turtles.

915,1400,,30/06/2020,06/30/2020 00:02,"“Ew” I’m about to embark on an airplane with some of my friends. It’s not clear where I’m going except that once we get onto the plane, I see this mental map of where it’s going and what countries I’m passing. It feels like we’re on our way to New Zealand. At the airport, I don’t realize that we have to take some kind of shuttle. I’m unclear as to why we have to take a shuttle when we’re already at the airport. However, it’s included with our ticket. We wait in this line. There are six of us and tons of other people. It’s packed. I guess there’s a number of shuttles because we wait, the crowd moves, we wait again, the crowd moves. So, as we are moving again I’m thinking, “Okay, this time we’re actually going to get on the shutte.” The shuttle is shaped like a mini airplane. The cockpit area is very short and then there is a little bit wider area. The seats in the cockpit area are like parallel parking - there are five on each side and once you get in, you’d be facing each other. Then the seats are more facing forward like an actual airplane with two and an aisle and two more. They’re facing the cockpit. I get separated from my friends because there are only five seats in the cockpit area. I have to sit in the first row of seats facing forward. I look over and who sits beside me but Donald Trump. I am completely horrified. I’m trying to squish myself as close to the side of the plane as I can. I’m just in shock, thinking: “How did this happen, how did this happen, how did this happen?” I keep thinking I'm In a plane but it’s taxiing down a major highway. I’m so invested in the idea that it’s a plane and it’s taxiing that when we’re going through traffic, I’m thinking the wings are going to be clipped off. I have to keep reminding myself that we’re not on the plane yet. Because I’m sitting beside Donald Trump, there are reporters and people with cameras and other people behind us that are trying to take pictures. That’s why I’m trying to shrink away from him - I don’t want to be in the picture, I don’t want it to look like I’m with him at all. The side of my leg is exposed. I’m horrified that he’s going to look at this and even maybe try to touch it. So again I keep trying to squish further and further away from him. The people that are sitting across the aisle from us, I realize I know the woman from somewhere. She says, “Freya?” I look over and see that I do know her but I can’t remember from where. I say, “Yes.” She’s sitting with a young man and I say, “Oh is this your son?” She says it is. He’s rolling his eyes. I’m thinking that he’s doing this because he thinks I’m with Donald Trump. Then, I’m telling my friends: “Can’t you please make any more room for me?” That’s when Donald Trump says my name and says, “Oh it’s okay, Freya.” That’s when I look down and notice that part of my thigh is exposed. It’s awful. I sit back in my seat because there’s no room. I look and see there are even more than five people stuffed into the cockpit. Then I hear the sound like in an old movie when a photo’s been taken, or maybe it’s from a cartoon...I’m like, “Oh my god, what if I’m in a picture with him?” The little mini airplane keeps going. It finishes its circuit and finally ends up at the airplane on the tarmac. We’re starting to get out. Donald Trump asks me: “When will we see each other again?” I’m thinking, “Oh my god! This is such a nightmare!” I just don’t answer and I’m trying to rush away and I’m trying to catch up with my friends. I’m saying to them, “Don’t leave me with that guy!” We get on the airplane. He’s gone. The airplane goes down a really long, long, long runway. As I look out the window to the left of me, I see all these strange plastic toys. They’re human-sized. There are people in them. They are powered by propulsion, so you have to get some kind of human speed or endeavor in order to get it to move through the water and then it will move on its own. So as we pass by, there’s this one person with mixed features that looks androgynous. All that is exposed out of the surface of the water is their face. Their expression is one of determined defeat or resignation and acknowledgement of defeat. There’s another one exactly the same as the first - same kind of features and exact same plastic vehicle apparatus, only it’s now in the air. Once they get up in the air, the thing keeps flying and going and the person can relax. I also note that these look like plastic bathtub toys. We taxi by a lot of these. They are all very bright in color - pink and green, pale orange, pale blue, and pale yellow. The plane finally takes off. We pass by this other person who is in this plastic version of what the first airplane looked like with the wings sticking out and canvas on them like Icarus would have used. The person has to use their own foot power to get it off the ground. That’s when I see that we’re flying over South America. The plane goes from North America down to South America, then it goes towards the East. I see us going across the Atlantic Ocean. Then it goes up again over Africa and I get a really close look of the Middle East. I start to notice things about the Middle East that I’ve never seen before. Then it veers away and starts to go south and east again over India and towards the Philippines. That’s when I think we’re going to New Zealand.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I arrive at my final exam presentation and instead of speaking, I need to dance to a specific song. It’s a dramatic ballet. After the performance, I become aware that I have just shaped the future/changed the future. I receive awareness/communication within myself that I have changed the course of history by this act, a classmate is forever changed by the dance and is influenced by art instead and he no longer becomes an evil politician but rather a philanthropist of the arts. It happened again, I was to meet at a bar at a hotel and talk to someone sitting there. I did. We talked about how I was so depressed but then got help and it changed the way I interacted with my own trauma. I gave him the number of my therapist and I became aware that instead of suicide bombing the town at the end of the year, this man I spoke to would fall in love at the end of the year. I started following all of these instincts, knowing I was shaping a better future through small acts of kindness, love, passion, art. It became all consuming. I saw someone having a conversation and I became aware that they were receiving the same kind of transmissions as I had been. I kind of kept an eye on them and eventually they asked if I was following them. I asked why they were doing the things they were doing and eventually we realized we were on the same mission. Soon, we had formed a whole community of receivers. We had meetings and at one meeting I remember bringing the issue to the table that my old self and motivations and trajectories were so changed, like I had died and replaced by prescience. I still had my own memories from before but I was sharing my self and body with this prescience that had nothing to do with me as my own person.

They’re wearing costumes, but I can see who they are. I actually worked at two restaurants when I was at university. There are staff from both of these restaurants in this room. Julie married Da and they had a baby. They’re there, too. At first I don’t notice them because they’re all wearing costumes. The people are gathered to go somewhere. Then I leave the room with Julie and Dan and we’re in this other place. They have a baby. I’m asking them where the baby is. Then we just kind of float back and we’re in this room where everyone has gathered again. The costumes are quite elaborate. They are wearing face paint and everyone has had really elaborate things done to their hair. The costumes are like what the Hoop Dancers would wear at pow wow in Canada. In real life, my cat woke me up in the middle of this with a really loud meow right in my face, so it scared me and I lost most of the threads of the first part of this dream. When I went back to sleep, I’m where I used to figure skate when I was young. I’m watching the skaters. I’m sitting with my dad and stepmom. All of sudden, my friend Ellie is there. She died of cancer about 13 or 15 years ago. She’s got a platter in her hands. It’s got big fat straws on it - a little bigger than the kind you would need for a milkshake. Half of the straws are decorated with colored balls on the end and the others are plain. She’s got them heaped up as if serving them on the platter. It’s like something she would have done - she would make things and bring them just to make people happy. So she’s down giving these to the hockey players and skaters. She moves through the stands and goes over to where my dad and stepmom are sitting. I’m sitting back from them and am separated from them. I don’t want a straw because it has bubblegum and these candy balls. I can taste them in my mouth and I don’t want all that sugar. But I hear her call my name: “Freya, get over here. I’ve got one for you.” So I start to walk closer to her. But I’m not back to where my dad and stepmom are sitting. She gives me one. I put it in my mouth and notice it’s warm and there’s a slight bubblegum flavor. I can feel it soak my mouth. I say, “What’s in this? How did you get the gum in this straw?” She says, “I heat it up with taffy first.” I think that’s what I taste. Then very quickly the sugary flavor starts to go. I wonder where I can spit this out because I don’t want it in my mouth. She says, “Come on. You’re coming with us.” I turn around and notice that her sister is also there. I tell her, “My dad, I need to let him know where I’m going.” She says, “It’s okay. He’ll be okay for a bit.” I follow her out of the arena and we get into a pickup truck. She says, “Come on, let’s go see my mom and dad.” We drive the truck slowly. The truck seems to be bigger than these little streets are wide and I wonder if the streets just seemed bigger because I was a little kid. We’re almost at her parents’ place. I’m saying, “But I really need to tell my dad where we were going. He’s going to be worried about me.” I look down and say, “Oh we don’t have enough cell phones in this time and age. I can’t even call him.” She says to me, “Your dad was crying when I saw him. It’s okay.” Then I get more distraught. She says, “He knows where my parents live. He’ll know where to come get you.” I think that he won’t. She agrees to take me back to the arena. Before we go, the truck kind of bursts out of this bush at the top of the house. I think, “How did we get all the way over here?!” Then all of a sudden I realize this is the dance studio I used to go to when I was five. There was a really steep driveway that ran up the side of the house. The lessons were in this old woman’s house. I think, “How is this truck even making it down the side because it’s so steep?” It does, though. We get to the bottom and she starts to slowly turn the truck. It’s like it’s floating and is not even on the road. It starts heading back towards the arena. I feel like I’m not going to get to my dad in time.

He caught me staring at him and I said, “I’m sorry, you remind me of my friend’s husband (I named him) but I know you’re not him. I feel like I know you.” He introduced himself quietly and smiled so I saw all his teeth but I don’t remember his name. His voice was so kind. He took off his baseball cap and put it on my head over my straw hat, and nestled it in to make sure it was on there. He said something about there’s only eight groups of us at this beach. Then he got in the water. Then Rory and I decided we were hungry, debating between tacos and lobster rolls so we started walking on this decrepit but very crowded boardwalk. We saw lots of artists, lots of homeless people. One woman was sitting in a wheelchair; her face was painted grayish white but her lips were moving and I asked if she was okay but she didn’t answer and everyone kept walking by. She was dying slowly right there invisible but how could you miss her. It was like her body was 95 perfectly entombed. Then the waves started to come at first splashed through the boardwalk and then bigger where we had to hold onto the railings. Then we turned to leave and the waves kept coming and washing out the boardwalk in every direction, the railing was not sturdy; there were areas it was replaced with children safety gates and didn’t feel sustainable and I held on by the tips of my fingers and felt the water lift the rest of my body up and thought I couldn’t hold on any longer. People were just holding on wave after wave and we were losing each other but I wasn’t panicked because I let my body just float when it needed to float and move when it could. The people with their feet on the ground kept getting knocked over. I shouted to let go, let go and hold on hands only but they didn’t listen. After what felt like forever, it stopped. I walked along the inside of the artist areas and people were in there with water on the floor but otherwise unaffected. A group of white young women wearing all white shirts and green shorts came in perfectly dry and complaining loudly that they weren’t letting people in because of the waves and I really gave it to them. I let them know about the severity of the ordeal and they needed to be careful too if they were going down there. They didn’t seem to care that people just died. They just shrugged their shoulders.

931,1402,,03/07/2020,07/03/2020 00:04,"“The Accident” I seem to be working for or alongside on a project. There’s a sense of routine, purpose, ease, camaraderie with some people. There’s a vast lake, a beach, a forested area, and a clearing. What I can see is forests for miles and miles and miles, a clearing and then the beach. The beach is not big - it’s a Canadian beach with a bit of sand and then the body of water. There’s an image of Ken. He’s raking or something - he’s doing something to the land. I feel like I’ve just finished doing what I’m supposed to be doing. I wade into the lake, swim for a little bit, and move from a deep area to a more shallow area. There’s some vegetation in the lake - lilly pads and leaves flowing by - and then a wide open area that feels really deep. The water is clean and fresh and this crystal blue. There’s some white cap on the surface and a blue sky above. It’s quite pleasant. I’m floating around and enjoying this. I get out of the water after a bit. I go into a big farmhouse and am doing food preparation and feeding/taking care of some kids. This repeats in the dream several times. This is where the sense of routine and purpose comes in. Each time I’m swimming at the end of my job. Ken is working in the house, too. I think it’s his house and kids. His wife lives there, too. Her job takes her away from the land. I think she’s a lawyer. This one day I wake up and have the sense of this big pain in my head. I’m starting to become aware of the room I’m in. I can’t move my body. I feel like I don’t remember what happened. I see Ken. He’s in the room. He says, “You were in an accident.” He leaves. I’m in this room in the hospital. I don’t remember what happened. Time passes. I appear back in that same farmhouse. But I still have this really intense pulsing in my head and pain - I can’t touch my face. Ken’s wife says to me: “Do you know what happened?” I say, “I don’t.” She says, “That’s okay.” I walk back down to the beach and am thinking of going for a swim, but am afraid I can’t swim. I just stay there for a little bit and then go back to the house to do what I used to do - some things in the kitchen and taking care of kids. Ken must have been doing his thing on the land during the day. He comes back in and asks me the same question his wife had asked: “Do you remember what happened?” I say, “No. Why don’t you tell me?” He says, “The doctors told us not to tell you, but you might remember on your own.” The dream repeats this process for a few days. Then one day I go back down to the beach and I feel like that big heavy painful feeling on my face is gone and I want to go swimming. I wade into the water. I was by myself. Now I see some other people out on the water. I don’t know who they are and they’re so far away I can’t identify them. I’m thinking the water is safe. Suddenly Ken appears to me and says to me: “Are you sure you should be doing this?” I say, “Yeah, why shouldn’t I be doing this?” He says, “Well, this is where you had that accident.” He doesn’t say anything else. I’m wondering if I’m supposed to remember something or if I’m not supposed to be here. I feel this vague sense of having lost a whole bunch of time that I can’t recall. I wade into the water anyway. Ken is behind me and wading into the water, too, as if to catch me or something. I wade in further until the water is up over my chest. I’m bobbing around and thinking, “Hmm, that’s funny. I don’t think I know how to swim.” Ken either just stands in the water or puts his hands under me to assist me in swimming. All of a sudden, I’m back in the house. I’m in a bed. Ken’s wife is standing over me and says, “Do you remember what happened?” I say, “No.” She says, “The water funneled up and spit you out and threw you out onto the land. How does your head feel?” I feel around my face with my fingers and there’s this thudding pulsing as if my head is going to explode. She says, “It’s okay, just rest.” She leaves and I hear her just outside the door talking to Ken. He says, “I thought we weren’t supposed to tell her.” She says, “I didn’t say anything. I just told her what happened yesterday.” I rest for a little then decide to get up. I go out to the kitchen. There’s an island in the middle with some stools around it. I sit down on a stool and say, “I think it’s about time somebody told me what really happened before.” This time Ken answers. He says, “Okay. Last time the water ejected you, you were hit by a train.” Then, before I wake up, I’m remembering feeling the impact. I remember thinking I was going to die and am not sure if I’m actually alive or just reliving the days of doing this job and trying to swim in the water.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

943,1403,,05/07/2020,07/05/2020 00:03,"“The Gym” I’m in a really big gymnasium. It’s so crowded I can’t see anything. I can’t see the floor or the equipment. I’m supposed to be teaching in a few hours. I go outside the building to get some air. I notice that I’m really depressed. I was depressed in the gym. I’m depressed outside. I feel detached from all the people around me. I don’t want to be there. The air is dusty and feels dirty. Then my brother swings by to where I’m standing. He asks if I can help him out for a few minutes. I say, “Well I have to be back here at 7 to teach.” He says, “That’s fine. We’ll be back in plenty of time.” I get in the car with him. Immediately, it’s like he’s driving with this really rash intent to get somewhere really quickly. I feel the car is moving more quickly than is safe. Immediately he goes right onto a 7-lane highway. He races over and we stop at a gas station parking lot and there’s a trailer. He asks me if I will hook the trailer to the ball and hitch at the back of the car. I say, “Sure.” I get out of the car. I pick up the end of the trailer with the female end. I think, “Hmm, I wonder if I can lift this without him.” It lifts really easily and I think it’s odd because it should be heavier than this. As I go to attach it to the male end at the back of the car, I notice both ends are made of plastic and realize that’s why it felt too light. As I set the female part on top of the male part, there’s a little cap that’s not quite big enough to reach over the top of the ball. There’s no resounding click when it makes contact. There’s no side pinions that go down through the top to the bottom like there normally would be. Of course, they would have been made of metal, but they’re not. As I’m doing this, I’m picturing the metal one and what the parts and pieces would look like. I’m thinking, “Oh no. This is not good.” I yell into my brother, “Do you know this is made of plastic?” He says, “Yes. It will be fine. Don’t worry about it.” I detach and reattach it a couple of times. I tug on it with my hands. I’m still really dubious about this. He keeps telling me, “Come on, we have to go.” I think, “Well okay, he must have done this before because he moves a lot of things with trailers, so I guess I’m just going to have to trust him.” I get back in the car. He starts to take off. I notice that the trailer isn’t attached and I tell him this. He stops and tells me to go back out, pull the trailer back up and reattach it. I’m still saying, “The whole thing is plastic. This isn’t going to stay on your car when you’re speeding on the highway.” He says, “Yes it will.” I get out and do what he asks me to do - pull the trailer back on, pull the flimsy cap back over. I get back in the car and this time it actually says. He zooms on the highway. We pull off on the other side to this industrial air. The dusty dirty air now has grease molecules in it. It smells like petroleum. I stay in the car. He gets out and quickly loads something onto the trailer. He turns the car and trailer around, and sometimes it stays attached. Now it has heavy things in it. But we zoom back to the highway and zoom back to the gym where he drops me off. I have ten minutes before I have to teach. Luckily, the people have started to leave, so there’s a window before the other people arrive for what I’m teaching. I see what they have for equipment. I’m teaching Pilates. I see they have the thicker mats stacked up and the bender balls you squeeze. I tell the people waiting for the class to get a mat and a ball and set themselves up. I have five minutes until class starts. I walk across to the storeroom to see what they’ve got. I find those rubber resistance bands and gliders for moving planks. I think that’s good for next time and I’ll just go with the bender balls and thick mats because it’s only a half hour class. I go back out. People are set up on their mats. Other people have come in and set up stationary bikes between the mats. I’m thinking that this is not safe. I look around and there are so many people that I can’t see who's in charge. I can’t see the clock, either. I just start my class. I take them into one series of exercises. Everybody is responding super super slowly. The bicycle people keep getting in the way. I look at the clock and my class is over already, but we haven’t even done anything. This brings that really heavy depressed, pointless, going nowhere dejection back into my body again. The people stack their mats on the side. There’s no interaction between the students and me. They’re like zombies. I’m going back to the storeroom to put the equipment away. There is a mirror and I look at myself. My face was infected with pus on the forehead, under my left eye, on my left cheekbone, and from the top of the left side of my forehead across to the middle. I’m looking for something to soak up the pus. I can’t find anything. Then I go back out. This other instructor who normally teaches yoga is trying to teach the people on the stationary bikes to do yoga on top of the bikes. I just wonder what’s wrong with everything. I don’t like this environment and don’t want to be part of it.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

947,1404,,06/07/2020,07/06/2020 00:02,"“Ouiglio and The Dog that Moves Sideways” I am in a car. I’ve been given the instruction to drop something off at the house that belongs to a friend of mine who is a bartender in a restaurant. He is a very social person. He’s very outgoing. He’s a good dad and has a couple kids. He sells cars and works at the bar a couple shifts a week because he enjoys the people and the contact. He’s asked me to come to the bar, pick something up, and drop something off at his house. I know where the bar is. I drive that way and meet him there. He gives me a package - it’s a rectangle, plain, and grey, almost like a cake box from a bakery but more sturdy and heavier. I go back to my car and put it in my car. He tells me the name of his street because in the dream, I’ve never been to his house. It’s a really strange flow of vowels and consonants together. He tells me very clearly to go down to the end of the street and turn right at the McDonald’s. The street runs parallel to the street that McDonald’s faces. I do this and all that happens is I drive into the parking lot behind the McDonald’s - it belongs to the McDonald’s and doesn’t lead anywhere else. In my confusion, I drive around the area looking for a street with the name, but I can’t find it. I drive back to the bar. As I’m parking the car I see another person - Stephanie - she’s a server but sometimes manages the bar. She has with her a very odd looking dog. She’s nervous about leaving it alone because she’s rescued it from somewhere. So she’s brought it with her to keep it by her side during her shift. She calls it a dog, but it doesn’t look like a dog. It’s small like the size of a miniature poodle. It doesn’t really have poodle hair or even dog hair. It has a thick cotton yarn six-inch long hair or fur or covering. Its face is kind of like a llama. The “dog” is in a bag. She takes it out of the bag. I’m giving her my attention. She’s excited about this creature. It’s like she’s been waiting to adopt it for a long time, but because of its odd habits and strange nervous system, she’s not supposed to leave it in the house until it adjusts to our climate or world. I say, “Oh wow, I’m so happy for you.” She says, “Yeah, I’ll take it out of the bag and show it to you.” The dog stands there. Normally dogs will dig in the dirt with their front paws and the dirt flies between their legs and behind them. But its upper body is twisted, so when it digs, its torso and paws bend to a ninety degree angle off to the side. I’m thinking, “Hmm, that’s really odd.” She picks the dog back up. I follow her into the bar because I have to talk to my friend about where his house is. I sit there waiting for him not to be busy with customers. She asks me if I’ll watch the dog in the bag for a moment. I do. I touch the dog and notice the texture of its coat. It’s like ropes. It’s very strange. Then I get this energetic flow from the dog. I feel like I’m suddenly transported to a different perspective. It’s like all of a sudden I see a quantum field. I see now the driveway and street behind the McDonald’s was there all along but I missed it because I was looking for something that looked like a street. My friend is still busy with customers and I don’t talk to him. Stephanie comes back and I give her the dog. I get back in my car and follow the instructions. As I go back behind the McDonald’s, I see the street. I wonder why I didn’t notice it before. I turn down the street, find his house, drop off the package, get back in the car and find my way back home.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

The two of them are showing me around the city. They’re showing me places where statues have been pulled down and things have been destroyed. All the things that have been destroyed are the white male patriarchy tributes to other white males. We’re in a park. The grass is still green - Gaia is doing just fine in the dream. But all things human-made are falling down and in disrepair. I see a lot of steel and metal that’s been pulled down. It’s all crooked and bent and broken in places. She’s telling me, “They don’t see us and they don’t honor us. They don’t care for us and they don’t put us first. That’s why it all has to come down.” Then the dream shifts and I’m with my ex. His girlfriend is with him. She’s a younger blonde woman. I walk up to her and say, “We haven’t met because this idiot has never introduced us. My name is Rose and I’m the mother of those two children over there.” The kids are in this part of the dream, too. We’re in a neighborhood. They’ve moved and they’re showing me their new house. I’m seeing where they live now so I can pick up the kids when it’s my turn. She’s actually quite easy to get along with and there's a good vibe between us. My ex is still annoying. He’s just combative with me. He’s trying to talk to me, but the tone in his voice is so condescending and really forceful. There’s no room for discussion with him. He’s just giving ultimatums. I’m not feeling like listening to that, so I ignore him as usual. I go over to see the kids. The kids are kind of squirrely. My son is happy to see me; my daughter, not so much. They’re both really clear that they want to live with their dad in this house that he and his girlfriend have. The house has swings in the front yard and a waterslide. There are lots of fun things to do here, so of course the kids are going to pick that. Then the scene shifts again. I’m in a downtown area in a community center. It’s run by people of color. It’s an education center where you can come learn about the different cultures and histories of other places. The history of the U.S. is also being taught, but it’s all the stuff we were never taught in school. It’s all the stuff that was not whitewashed and what is coming out now in real time about the history of the peoples here and how they were treated. The emphasis is on the culture. It’s all young women in this place, except for a few young men who are coming and going and some two-spirit or trans people. A young woman stops me. They are excited to show me all the stuff I never knew about their country and where they come from - their history, their roots. I’m having this crazy moment of realizing how little I do know and how exciting it is to observe these young people and absorb their love for their country and where they came from. I’m also excited to learn there is so much more to life than I thought. It’s fantastic and amazing. Instead of me feeling put upon or defensive, I’m very excited by this treasure trove of knowledge and that these people are so excited to teach. There are a few people within the community center who are a bit contemptuous of me and what they would call my ignorance. But overall, there is an excitement to share. Even though I’m the ignorant white woman, there is still tolerance because I'm there to learn and am excited to learn about all these things, especially the cultural aspects. At one point i pick up a wooden carving of India. What I notice is that unless the person hadn’t told me it was India, I wouldn’t have known what country it was. I had a moment of shame that I should have known what country this was. But I didn’t know and the shapes of the countries change all the time, so now I do know.",Rose,last_nights_dream
952,1405,,07/07/2020,07/07/2020 00:04,"“The Long Night” I’m riding my bike. I put a few things in my backpack. I notice that I’m wearing long pants and a long sleeved shirt. It’s dark. I ride my bike all the way from one end of town to the other. The town ends. I keep riding. I come to the home of my daughter’s boyfriend’s parents. I stop there for a little bit. The mom’s sister is there, too. I feel detached from them in some way. I think they’re talking about something that’s racist. Because I’m kind of detached, they don’t really care if I’m there or not. I get back on my bicycle and leave. I keep riding. It’s still dark. I’m getting tired. Then I stop at a building. I go in. Inside are the studio owners of a place I used to teach at, but don’t anymore because of their unethical way of scheduling their staff. The building isn’t a studio though, it’s just this long building. They both appear to be busy with other tasks. The building is a long rectangle. I think I’m just there to rest. There isn’t anything in it. I’m not talking to the owners, I'm just standing there. Suddenly there’s a counter, like you’d see at a bank. They’re each on one side of the counter. A woman comes up to the counter. Now I’m on the same side as one of them. She is busy and writing in some kind of big ledger. The woman asks a question. Now I see that I have some tickets in my hand. I tell her that it’s a raffle for my son’s hockey team. She says, “Oh, in that case, I’ll buy tickets.” I’m writing her name on them and then ripping them out of the booklet. I hand her the tickets and say, “He’s also in theatre. I know it’s an odd combination - hockey and theatre.” She says, “No, my son does the same thing. It’s nice to have boys who are interested in both.” We start talking together and leave. I realize I need to use the washroom. I go into the washroom and the other woman does, too. She’s in the stall next to me. I’m getting toilet paper off the roll on the wall, but it’s not really toilet paper. It’s actually thick towels. I hear her say, “Do you have any extra?” I say, “Yes, one moment.” I’m getting some off the roll for her. It takes a little while because they are thick towels. As I turn to hand her a bunch, her face is through the wall as though the wall is made of soup, or the way it is in movies like a quantum wall. Her face, which I don’t seem to have noticed before, is very white and her hair is really thin and damp and lank. I hand her the towels and both of her hands are through the wall that partitions the stalls and she takes it. She disappears and finishes whatever she’s doing. I hear her leave. I’m standing at the sink washing my face. I’m wondering if I’m going to be cold because it’s getting colder as the night progresses. I get back on my bike and I’m really cold and my legs are tired. I don’t know where else there is to go. I wonder if a bus comes out this far and if I can put my bicycle on the bus. But then I look down and see that I have no purse and no wallet. I realize I can’t get on a bus. I turn my bike to go back in the opposite direction I’ve come from. I’ve come a really long way. I notice as I ride by, a platform that comes to a point like a triangle. It has asphalt on the top and a curb on either side. A girl is standing on it, as if it’s a bus stop out in the middle of nowhere. I ask her if she’s waiting for a bus. She says, “I’ve been standing here a really, really long time and no bus has come.” I tell her, “I don’t think busses come out this far.” She says, “Are you going back towards town?” I say, “Yes.” She says, “Well let’s walk together.” I get off my bike. My legs are tired of peddling anyway. I walk beside her. We walk in silence for a really long, long time. Then I ask her if she doesn’t mind telling me which end of town she lives. She says she lives in the west end. We’re still quite a bit towards the east. I say, “Oh so do I.” We have to walk all the way through town to get there. I wonder, “Maybe we can share a taxi?” She says, “I don’t have my money with me.” I say, “Right, neither do I.” We’re walking and walking. Then we get to the outskirts of town finally and I notice the sun is starting to come up. She says, “Oh, I have a room here at this end. Why don’t we stop here and rest a bit.” We go in. it’s just a room in a really old house that’s seen better years. The front door opens. Inside is a really long high ceiling. There’s a couch to sit on and I immediately go to the couch and sit. There’s some kind of little table, but it’s not really a table. It’s like two wooden boxes stacked on top of each other, about one foot by one foot square, and tall. She has some things on it - little tiny containers. She says to me: “This wallpaper has been bugging me for a really long time. I think I want to take it down.” I notice that the wall is a homemade checkerboard. She tells me the landlord did it himself. There’s a pale green paint on the wall. He’s made the checkerboard out of wallpaper and paint squares alternating. The part made of wallpaper is really interesting with white and colors - light blue and orange watercolor wash. She says, “I don’t know how he did this, or I would paint over it.” I get up from the couch to take a good look. I say, “Hmm, it looks like there’s some kind of pigment in the paint that as he applied it with the roller, it was heat activated and the color pigments expanded and bled into each other.” She says, “Hmm maybe you’re right.” But as I look deeper into it, I see that it’s made of a whole bunch of different scraps of wallpaper that he’s somehow laid on top of each other. There are layers and layers and layers. It looks like multicolor paint, but it’s these layers and layers of colored wallpaper scraps. Then I see that it’s only thumbtacked to the wall. I say, “Look. It’s starting to come off at the corners, so you can just take the whole thing off.” So she starts to take the thumbtacks out and puts them in the little containers on the wooden crate table. Underneath that are more colors of wallpaper and layers. She’s happy with it, but it’s the same thing underneath, so that’s interesting. As she’s doing this, a woman comes in with her young son. The young boy didn’t really look like his mom. The mom’s face was round like the moon. His head was longer and narrow. I remember thinking that he was such an interesting combination of features. He was halfway in between the washed out color of Heather and the vibrant darker color of his mom. I realize this is a daycare. The woman addresses the person I was walking with as Heather. For the first time I notice that Heather is kind of washed out. She has features, but they don’t stand out from her skin very much. It’s hard to see what she looks like. I notice she has paler skin and freckles and this pale mousy brown hair. The woman asks Heather: “Do you believe in conspiracies?” I notice that one of the checkerboards has the word, “conspiracy” written on it. Heather replies, “Yes.” The woman who enters says, “Good. I’ll be back soon for my son.” Then she gets in her car. The wall of the building has disappeared. She tells me to hop in the back. The car looks like a Model-T Ford. There’s a newer model car that imitates its look with the wide panels. The car is made of wood. The back part has a little rumble seat and she indicates I should sit there. I notice the woman’s skin is a deep brown. She’s wearing a fantastical hat. Her dress is a pale mauve and it’s ethereal and floats like a Great Gatsby dress. She’s wearing round John Lennon glasses. I get in the rumble seat. She starts the car and I say, “Are you sure this car will make it?” She says, “There’s nothing wrong with this car at all.” She drives it through the house, which has gelatinous quantum type walls and doors. We go out to the back and there’s hay on the ground. There’s a barn, but we’re in an old urban city area, turn of the century with row houses that went up really fast to house people who worked in factories. But there’s a barn! It’s really unconducive to the rest. She says, “This is one of the only barns left in this town.” She parks the car and we get out. The woman disappears and now I go back into the house from the back. Heather and the young boy are in the only other room in the building - it’s a kitchen. I start putting food together. I look in the cupboards. There’s something that’s corn-based, like a ground up corn. The other ingredients are really odd and I don’t think it will go together. I also notice that it’s safe for me to eat because it’s all corn-based. I start mixing something up. As I’m adding water, it turns into other ingredients. We eat.

I knelt down and looked inside to see if I could find the gerbil as I was worried it had escaped. I couldn't find it. I looked up to the ceiling and saw that one of the tiles had fallen in.

954,1801,,07/07/2020,07/07/2020 00:06,"My family and I were at the old house on the campus of UFC. We were preparing to go out on an excursion during the zombie apocalypse. My brother William and I went out to the driveway where a row of short swords were stuck into the ground. We pulled them out more easily than we should have been able to and began testing them. I noted that the lengths were short enough that they would mostly be used for stabbing zombies at close quarters. William preferred a short sword, but I wanted something more along the lines of a fencing sword or rapier. I found one and tested it out. My only concern was that it wouldn't be enough to cut completely through a zombie's head or neck in order to kill it in one swipe. The rest of the family came outside and we began to head out dressed in some form of military garb. At least one of us was wearing camouflage.  We traveled for a ways and setup our camp for the night in some kind of underground cement area under or surrounded by roads. Imagine that part of a road is removed and below the pavement is hollowed out a long rectangular area lined with cement. It's a bit hard to describe. The surrounding landscape was desert-like with mountains in the distance. It had the feeling of largeness and openness. We went to sleep that night in sleeping bags, but some entity came in and began to try to force its way into my sleeping bag. It's slightly translucent hands and arms were reaching in, but by a show of nothing but willpower I was able to make it leave. I found out the next morning that a friend had showed up in the night and had helped save us from the creature. We decided that we had to travel out west and my dad suggested that we walk along the train tracks. My mom pointed out that the authorities would arrest us if we did that, and I, not wanting an argument, made the further point that walking across the gravel of train tracks is painful and slow. Off to the west (though somehow it was also to the east as it was the wrong direction from where we wanted to go) I heard the crying of an infant. I knew that I had to go find out what was wrong, so I went off by myself to where a stone tower was. Inside, I found a large wooden box stuffed with hay and inside was the child disguised as a doll. I pulled it out carefully worrying that it was injured or dying of hunger or thirst as I did not know how long it had been there. It was okay, but I saw that hiding in the hay behind it was its mother. This was shocking as the box was not large enough to hold a person. Somehow she was there, and the way she looked stuffed into the box was distorted and creepy. I left and as I did, the setting became that of a fantasy world. I and our companions were knights. When I got back to our troop, we began a discussion about the evil king and whether or not I could defeat him with my swordsmanship. My feelings about this were complex: I thought that I could do it because in this story, which I recognized partially as being a constructed narrative, I was the hero and incredibly skilled. But at the same time, I knew that I was not skilled and worried that I would fail. I also knew that I could beat my older brother Carson and that he could beat the king too, so I reasoned that I should be able to win.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

We all helped her prepare for the mission by resourcing her with different things she might need. There were children everywhere playing. I was scolding some that were misbehaving. We were all in outside buildings/ structures in our village; there were no doors or roofs. Everyone was tending things. I was watching the children and a spider crawled up my arm to tell me something, looked at me, and bit me. And I was bleeding. I was lying on an outdoor lounge bed thing and the blankets were all white and a drop of blood fell onto the blankets. So I told Sofia there would be blood. She came into the bed and everyone else did, too. We all cuddled and sang something I can’t remember. And she went off. When she came back she had blood for us to drink And told us we were free.

957,879,,08/07/2020,07/08/2020 00:02,"There’s a huge gathering of people all sitting at these long rectangular tables arranged end to end in a larger rectangle. I’m making pancakes. At first I make a nice batch of thin pancakes and distribute them as if I am feeding my own family, so I give two to each person and three to my husband. Then I look and realize there are so many more people to feed. I panic that they won’t be fed. I go back and cook another batch. I take a bite out of one, then soften the edge so it doesn’t look like it was bitten and I can give it away. I give one pancake to each person. Some people say no thank you. The people at the far end turn down the pancakes because they don’t trust these hippie kind of pancakes and others are watching their diets and don’t realize these are good for them. I make another batch and pass by my mother-in-law and my husband. She had been given two from the first batch and my husband was given three. I see that she has given her pancakes to my husband and he’s eating them, completely unaware that others are hungry. I hate it so much that they are totally unaware of other people’s needs. She could have given the extra pancakes away to the people who hadn’t had any food. He could have given his extra pancakes away instead of eating them all so quickly. I see that my brother-in-law is now trying to help in the kitchen. I’m annoyed by him, too, because he’s not being really helpful. I take another batch around. This batch is thicker. Some of the kids and their mom are helping to mix more batter. Their mom has poured the pancakes with a pan and used too much batter. I tell her to only use a spoon - she only needs a little bit for each pancake. Now there are really obese people. Some say no and some say yes to the pancakes. They feel the pancakes with goopy thick berry syrup. They’re so messy. When I go back to the kitchen area, it’s so messy. It’s not really a kitchen, just an area in the corner with a stovetop. The pancakes are all different sizes and textures. I don’t want to be involved in the project any longer. I leave. I’m walking around with a lot of different people, none of whom I recognize. It’s a hotel. I walk to the end of a hallway. I see Sophie and she bounces up to me, so happy to see me. She tells me all about her rituals and moon circles. I’m partially interested in what she’s sharing. Then I realize I’m responsible for the pancakes and need to get back. She walks with me through the hallways. We see a few people doing a yoga class together. We continue on. There’s a restorative yoga class happening and it’s extremely popular. I want to understand why so many people are attending because the teacher isn’t that great or special. I join near the front even though the class is in progress. I’m doing the postures and thinking it’s nice, but there’s nothing special about it. Suddenly this yappy dog comes running up and almost bites the teacher. A woman runs after the dog. She gets the dog and now somehow they’re all underwater. Another woman comes out from the crowd to help as if she knows them. She follows them out all the way up the stairs. I use this opportunity to leave and check on the pancakes. It’s nearly dark and I’m hoping everybody will have been fed their breakfast. But the pancakes are still cooking. There are pancakes of all sizes, some are stacked in baskets, some are stacked on plates and some are still cooking on the griddles. The heat is on but no one is watching. I’m worried that the pancakes will be burnt or too crispy. I take some of them off the griddle and keep some of them on to cook more. I step out and am told that the kids’ mother will be back with her husband later. They’re bringing their guns and will camp out and protect the pancakes overnight as they cook through the night. I guess it’s an okay idea, but I’m still uncomfortable with the pancakes cooking unattended. I switch off the heat on all the stovetops. I scoop the remaining pancakes out.",Ana,last_nights_dream1
958,880,,08/07/2020,07/08/2020 00:03,"We’re visiting a female teacher, somewhat like a swami or guru, at her luxurious apartments in a city. She is of Indian descent. She is very alluring and has a lot of wealth and beauty and power. We’re at the dinner table. Fae is going through a process of some kind - she’s having a hard time and people are gathering to help her. The minister’s wife does some beautiful singing and healing with hands, whooshing away the worry, concern and pain. Then people gather closer to help, but Fae feels complete and most of the people go away. I stay. George is sitting at the table and speaking with Fae in the voice of our shadow work teacher. He’s helping her get clear on some things. He looks at me and talks with me in the same voice. Then we have to go. I have to go with my husband and we must leave quickly. I have a bag and am going down a hallway to an elevator. I get in the elevator, but my husband is still back in the apartments. I am trying to hold the elevator open. A guy comes. He’s leering at me. He has my husband’s backpack. I don’t want to be stuck in this elevator alone with him - I have a bad feeling about him. After a while of me insisting that we hold the door open, other people come. A mom is pushing her mentally/physically disabled child in a big plastic car. Other people come in and the elevator is full. My fingers slip and the doors close. The elevator goes down and when we get to the street level, everybody pours out. We’re on the streets of New York. there’s no way to get back up, except if we stand in a long line for the next elevator. I’m panicked because I’ve lost my husband’s backpack. The guy has moved on. I see that the backpack has been dropped. I check and see that everything is still in it. I guess I just have to wait for my husband to come down and hope he can find me. The city is so big and overwhelming. Then it’s later in the dream and I’m back in the luxury apartments. The teacher is preparing to go out for the evening. My husband wants to go and so do I. She says we can both come, but she has a glint in her eye. I remember my son is asleep upstairs and we both can’t go if no one stays to watch him. I’m trying to figure out what we can do. There are other people in the house - her male consort and other people that my son hasn’t met. I guess it will be okay. She takes me upstairs and looks at my shoes. I’m wearing red moccasins that are good walking shoes, but she scoffs at them - they’re quite ugly. Her shoes have a point at the end and are intricately beaded with lovely tassels. She tells me I need to change my shoes if I want to go out with them. Then she tells me she has a wife for my husband or maybe my brother (who I don’t have in waking life). I’m confused and concerned. She shows me a picture - a Christmas card - with a family. She points out a woman with a round face and kinky hair. There’s also a photo of her with her friend and her son floating in a jacuzzi. They’re holding a onesie over the baby. I’m wondering how much time I’ll have with my husband if he’s with her. It’s very confusing. I realize that she’s talking about someone else.",Ana,last_nights_dream2
959,1194,,08/07/2020,07/08/2020 00:04,"I’ve been in school learning. I just have a vague impression of being in school. Right now I’m out. I’m either looking for food and have bought food from what used to be a McDonald’s, but things still look weird post-quarantine and there’s only limited availability. The golden arches sign is no longer available to be used. I’ve bought boxed cereal and some other items, but they’re stale. I’m going back to return them. I’ve gone inside the building. I have these two big grocery bags with the cereal and other stuff. I go back to the counter and tell the woman who’s working behind the counter in her viser and McDonald’s uniform that I’m returning these. The whole time I’m thinking that you can’t return cereal to McDonald’s, they don’t do returns. But she takes the cereal and whatever else I have in the bag. I’m really relieved. It was a big pain in the ass and burden to have all this cereal and other stuff that was stale and I couldn’t eat and spent money. I was relieved to get my money back, but also surprised. The scene shifts and I’m in a gigantic empty warehouse. A wedding or birthday is happening - something is being celebrated. But again, things are kind of strange because the crowd is sparse. There is a pastor or somebody doing the marrying or celebrating...or maybe someone has graduated? My friend from high school, Teresa, is there. She’s all by herself. I see her but she doesn’t see me yet. It’s been years and years since we’ve seen each other and I’m really excited. But for the moment our focus is on what’s happening in this party thing. The ceremony concludes and there’s a handful of other people - some men - one of which I think is her husband and the husband’s side of the family. I’m watching because it seems odd that she’s not hanging out with or sitting next to him. She’s off by herself. So I go to talk to her and say hello because I haven’t seen her in forever. She’s happy to see me and I'm happy to see her. We talk a little about the ceremony that just happened. There’s some sort of triage that has to happen. Someone is sick or ill and needs some help. I watch her as she helps this person. We’re still catching up. Then she finishes what she's doing and I ask her: “So how is your husband? How is your married life?” She gives me this look. I look at her fingers to see if she has a wedding ring on. She has multiple rings on. I think one of them is a wedding ring. But she gives me this look and is like, “It’s been the most painful thing I’ve ever experienced.” I'm not sure if she’s still married or not. She says, “He cheated on me.” I can see on her face that she still has pain around being cheated on. I still cannot tell if they’re still together or not by the way she’s talking. She is relaying to me the absolute pain she has experienced in finding out her husband cheated on her. I’m looking at her and am like, “Well, my husband didn’t cheat on me, but I’m no longer married and I’m in a situation where things are kind of hairy and frustrating and it doesn’t feel good.” We talk about that a little bit. She says, “It’s been so long and we have so much to catch up on.” As she’s telling me this, she’s talking really quickly because she has to catch a plane and leave now that the ceremony is over. Again, I’ve been looking at her fingers for a wedding ring and I’m also looking to see if she’s pregnant. I keep thinking she is pregnant, but I can’t quite tell. She tells me a little bit of her story. I realize that whatever plane she was supposed to catch, she’s probably missed it or we’re bending time because it’s taking awhile for her to tell this story. There is a sense of urgency that she has to go, though. I am feeling that I really want to hear her and witness for her. It seems important to do that.

960,1406,,08/07/2020,07/08/2020 00:05,"“Nightmare” I’m in a building in Burlington. It’s a specific location at Upper Middle Road and Brant Street. There’s a small plaza. The nightmare occurs inside one of those buildings. I’m in the building. There’s a man. He’s trying to kill me. I’m trying to hide from him. First I try to hide downstairs. Then I try to get away from him by going up one floor and hiding in some of the rooms. Then I’m able to make it back down the stairs and out the front door. But he finds me outside because there’s nothing to hide in outside. It’s a slightly industrial area and there are no cars in the parking lot. The parking lot is vast. There are no trees. None of the other stores are open in that little stripmall. So I go back in the same building. He’s still trying to kill me. This time there are a few people in the store. He owns the business in the building. He’s distracted by them and has to deal with them because they’re his customers. I’m trying to find a room where I can hide again. This time there are a few more things in the building and in the rooms, like furniture; whereas, the first time it was empty so he could just see me everywhere. This works for a little bit. But now I’m trying to find a way to get help. The same thing happens. When he finishes with the customers, he’s finding me. I go upstairs. There is more furniture to hide behind and the chase is delayed because of the furniture. This time when I head downstairs from upstairs, there’s even more people and more furniture. I’m trying to tell someone that he’s chasing me. It’s like I can’t get close enough to tell anyone so they can hear me. But it’s busier, so this delays it even more. Now I have some kind of job to do there. There’s some kind of involvement with serving food. Now people are eating. He has to make sure they eat. Now he’s a manager or something. I’m trying to make connections with people so I can sit with them and communicate to them that as soon as this meal is over this man is going to try to kill me and he’s a murderer. I don’t know if their lives might also be in danger. I do end up sitting down at a table with a woman. She’s East Indian. She’s looking at me. I’m making eye contact with her and trying to communicate that she needs to stay with other people and the only way of not getting killed by this guy is to keep the people in the building. But this isn’t communicated clearly. I think that she can understand by just eye contact. So now because there are thirty people in there eating with five tables, there are dishes to do and garbage to clean up. There is garbage upstairs, too. I’m thinking that if I can get the garbage collected upstairs where there is no one first, then back downstairs before everybody leaves, I won’t be in a scenario where everyone is gone and I’m all alone collecting the garbage. I do this. I run from room to room collecting the garbage, then back downstairs. Almost everyone is gone except for this woman who I had eye contact with and maybe two or three other people. I’ve added the garbage of the main floor and told the man I’m going to take the garbage to the big bin outside. This allows me to escape outside. Now there are cars to hide behind. I hide behind one of the cars. I get out my phone and am trying to dial 911, except every time I press 9, a 10 comes up. I get the second number punched in, which is 1, but the third number which is also supposed to be 1, every time I press it, a 2 comes up. So it’s 10-1-2. I do this over and over and over. Then I think, “Oh no! He’s going to know I’ve been out here too long.” So I go back in again. There’s only one person left inside. He’s in the office with them and there are invoices and forms to fill out. I go into the kitchen and am sweeping. The tables are all cleared for the second round. Then there’s this empty moment where the last customer leaves and he looks at me. He takes out a knife and starts chasing me again. I run upstairs. I can hear him and he’s right after me. I think this is it. I manage to make it down the hallway to the other set of stairs. I go back down to the main area. If there isn’t a full room of people there again, I would escape it one more time. This time I see that same woman. She invites me to sit at her table, so I do. I’m being served food. Someone brings me a partial plate of lasagna. I’m thinking I can’t even eat it because there’s wheat, dairy and beef - not one part I can eat. Somebody tells me that it’s okay, it’s gluten-free. I look at it suspiciously and think it’s not - I can tell it isn’t and even if I just ate the noodles, I wouldn't be able to eat anything else. I don’t eat it. I open up the layers of the lasagna with my fork and am peering into it. Then the cook comes out of the kitchen and tells me, “Yeah, I made it myself. It’s gluten-free.” I’m thinking, “Okay, you say that but I don’t believe you.” He goes back into the kitchen. I push the food around on the plate until everybody is finished. Then someone takes all the plates away. Now my job starts again. I get up and start clearing. Some of the people are starting to leave and I’m trying to figure out how I can get outside where there are lots of people, so I can dial 911. Then I see the cook come out. He has a plate of food and sits down to eat it. It’s the rest of the lasagna. I’m like, “You so lied. I know you are not a gluten-free person. You eat dairy and you eat beef.” I can’t trust anybody to be honest in here. Then, I’m clearing plates, scraping uneaten food into the bin, and thinking I’ll do the same thing I did before. I run upstairs and try to collect the garbage before everyone else leaves. There’s this little kid and he’s getting into the garbage and taking it out of the bag as I’m putting it in. I’m getting anxious that I won’t be able to complete this. I see my brother on the stairs. I ask him if he can please take this kid downstairs so I can finish what I need to do. He does. I finish. I get back downstairs. There are still people there. There’s some kind of issue and they’re talking to the man that’s trying to kill me and he’s having to deal with it. I put all the kitchen garbage in this big giant bag. He sees me but can’t say anything because there are people around and I’m doing what I’m supposed to. This time when I take the garbage out and hide between the cars, I get my cell phone out and have a paperclip that I’ve uncurled and I’m poking the numbers with the end of the clip. It goes through and there’s 911. I say, “There’s an emergency here. A murder. Someone’s trying to kill people.” Then I hang up and run back in. Now the tables have turned! I’m actually trying to keep the man there until the police come, so he gets caught. I’m deliberately going a bit slow. I’m talking to people, asking them if they like their meal or something. I can tell the man is a little suspicious and glares at me like, “what are you doing?” Then I hear the police sirens. I know they’re in the parking lot. That’s when I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

Learning is happening and there are a lot of students. I’ve gone into the doctor’s office, but it’s like a physical therapist’s office. The receptionist is my doctor’s wife. The doctor is actually my acupuncturist and naturopath. I go into see him because my body is hurting and aching and I feel terrible. I don’t have any energy and my body is falling apart. They start giving me medicines of some sort, but they don’t ask me if it’s okay and they don’t tell me what it is. I’m going along with it. At one point I hear him say to his wife: “Bring me the formaldehyde.” They have a pipette and they’re piping it into the corner of my mouth. It dawns on me that I don’t know what this stuff does and I don’t know if it’s good for me. I’m just letting them give it to me in the hopes that it will make me feel better and I’m desperate to feel better. I’m still not asking the right questions. They’re telling me I need to stop doing some of the things I’m doing because that’s what’s wearing me out. They say I have to stop working out. I’m like, “Umm, no. It’s not healthy to not work out at all.” I think what they’re saying is that I’m doing too much - there’s a scale of how much is good for you, then you get to a certain point where it’s no longer good for you. So they’re doing these things to me. I’m letting them, but one part of my brain is thinking that maybe I shouldn’t and I should stop and ask and find out what all this stuff is - just get more information.

It’s your mom’s birthday. We’re going to do this celebration for her.” My dad has planned all these things. I’m watching through the screen what’s happening. The house that he shares with my mom is packed to the gills with crap. It’s crazy how much stuff is in it. Hoarder style stuff. The surprise is that he’s having a tv crew come. It’s like a reality show and they’re going to go through all the stuff in the house, take what is resellable and sell it and give them the money, and take other stuff to the trash. They’re basically going to give the house a makeover, but there are treasures in this house that they’re going to take. Somehow I get sucked through the screen and I end up in the house. I’m going through this one closet and see the record player we grew up with. It has the record, Mickey’s Christmas Carol. It’s a record we used to listen to when we were kids. It’s red and the picture of the album cover was on the record, so Mickey, Goofy, Donald Duck and whoever was in that show are on the record itself. I’m looking at it. I’m like, “Wow, you’re going to give the record player away.” As I’m looking at it, the record falls apart in my hands. As I’m realizing it’s falling apart and there’s no other records to play, I’m like, “Well, we don’t need the record player anymore.” I hand it over to one of the people who is there with a truck and crew for the show. They take it. All of this stuff is getting cleaned up. My mom is there and she’s actually excited that all this stuff is going to make her money - it’s not that the house is getting cleared out. You can see the emotions on her face and she’s feeling upset that all of her stuff is being taken away - she has a lot of attachments to stuff. All of the kids are really excited about clearing it out. It’s really dark in the house, but as all of the stuff is moved out, it gets lighter and lighter. Then my dad has one more surprise for her. He takes her away from the house to do something - they’re going to dinner or an adventure of some sort. He has been so excited throughout this whole thing, like a little kid watching it all. He’s just so proud of himself and what he’s thought up and created and how he’s gotten this tv crew here. I can see that my mom is torn between being proud and excited about it and being sad. All my siblings are really excited. I’m going along for the ride, but don’t have feelings either way. I’m mostly observing, except for that record player.

We were going to push it out of one of the upper rooms of the house so that we could have enough distance gliding to get the aircraft running. It was too big to push out of a window and we realized that we would have to destroy part of the wall to allow it to get out.  We were all packing and getting ready and I had to find a restroom. One had just been taken, so I ran downstairs to find another. Eventually I was ready.  I went back upstairs and looked out of the window. On the ledge was a large, thick black snake coiled up absorbing sunlight. It had flattened itself a bit to have a larger surface area. I wasn't quite sure what it was but was worried that it might be a cottonmouth. I poked it gingerly with a broom handle and it slithered inside toward me but veered off to my left and squeezed it's way into an outlet in the wall. I used the broom and poked holes through the wall to find the snake. I used the broom like an exacto knife and sliced away large sections of the wall but I couldn't find the snake.   We escaped and I found myself in a fancy restaurant with my brothers and Grandma O.. Before I even got to order, a chocolate raspberry was placed in front of me along with a watery milkshake with ice cubes in a small glass. I wondered if this was just an appetizer.

My family was there helping out and I told them that I would have to call the airlines and ask them to give me a new flight. I was at the airport anyway and had to use the restroom as did Jared who was with me. I entered the bathroom to find that there wasn't a urinal. I started to pee into a red trash can which looked like that was what it was intended for. Then I realized that the other apparatus was in fact a urinal but it was too late. I put a new garbage bag into the trash can to hide what I had done so Jared would not notice. I think he did anyway.

It was directly across from where the towels was which was convenient. As I entered the hallway leading to the restroom, there was an explosion and in the distance I could see flames rushing toward me. I turned around and ran for it as the entire building behind me was engulfed in flames. I ran past many people, pushing past some and dodging others. I didn't have time to warn anyone or look for my mom. I eventually made it to a safe room where they sealed us in by lowering the many garage like doors. The room was dark and made of cement. 20 or so people were with me.  We could feel the heat from outside and I was worried that my mom was hurt. Eventually the fire was put out and we were all let out. The building was now the office warehouse and there wasn't much of a sign of a fire except soke slightly charred wood and boxes. J. D. came and told everyone that the fire was caused in the warehouse by someone plugging a phone into a line incorrectly and heating up the wire. This was a common mistake. They said that no one had died but that some had been injured. My mom wasn't there so I assumed that she had been taken to a hospital. I was nervous about asking but eventually went up to J. D. and asked him. He indicated that I should be quiet and not ruin the surprise. We all gathered in an open area with chairs where J. D. paraded out all of the people who we thought were injured. A mother was reunited with her daughter and I found my mom. I was happy but angry. J. D. had made everyone think their loved ones were hurt when they were fine, and all for the sake of making the company look good. He didn't see it that way nor did anyone else. The other mother asked, ""Can't you just be thankful that your mother is safe?""

I’m going to a hotel with a small group of people for an educational high level training of some kind. I don’t recall who was there, except for Jeremy. Zoe is still alive, but she’s at their house and near her death. We arrive and are settling in. Somewhere around three o’clock, Jeremy gets a call from Zoe. She's distressed and feels very close to death. He, unusually, denies it and her because she’s been having similar experiences and it’s been more stressful and anxiety producing than real. So he hangs up the phone. I go into meditation. I see her in the courtyard outside their house - but it’s not their house in waking life. She’s dancing barefoot on the concrete ground. She gets really tired and turns off the music. She goes to the deck and lays her head down on the wooden deck and falls asleep for the last time. Somehow, we found out she has died. I know the exact moment because of my vision - it was in that three o’clock afternoon after, like 3:11pm. I gather my things to go with Jeremy over to the house. All the arrangements have been made by her friends. There are interactions in the hotel before we left, but I can’t recall them now. There’s a sense we will be spending the night together. We make the winding drive back along the coast to the house. When we arrive, her friends have laid her body out in the barn. Pema is there along with other friends who I’ve seen in passing. They’re preparing for the funeral or celebration of life. They’re slicing lemons in the kitchen and in the garden gathering flowers. They’re also gathering and writing poetry and preparing for guests. We go inside. People are sitting in rows. I sit by myself at the end of a row. I turn around and there are people looking at me. They are people from my past who I don’t remember as I’ve lived in many places and known many friends and forgotten many people. They share their memories of me and how they haven’t forgotten me. They’ve even waited for me to return, and I never did and I didn’t remember them. There is one man in particular who I’m drawn to - he’s a Pacific Islander, very robust and of the islands. I’m deeply attracted to him and wonder what is between us. I also see deep pockmarks on his face from cystic acne when he was younger. There’s a woman sitting next to him who also has scars on her face from acne. The people are so crowded and sitting close together. The ceremony is about to begin. I’m a little concerned that we could all catch the coronavirus if anybody had it. I begin to lift my collar over my face, but decide against it and instead intend to breathe in my own space. People are singing and saying poetry for Zoe. It’s a beautiful ceremony. Some time passes. Jeremy tells me that Zoe has been moved to the grey house and there will be a viewing. He invites me to go. I walk in and see people sitting at banquet tables. Immediately I see my grandmother and she’s sitting next to my grandfather. My uncles are with them and so are Aunt Frieda and Bertie (they are twins and my grandmother’s sisters) and other people who are family - perhaps my grandmother’s other siblings. I’m overjoyed to see her and it’s so real, except that everyone has an otherworldly shine and vitality that is a more than human vitality. I don’t ever talk to my grandmother. I hug my uncles who are both still alive in waking life. I go to the end of the row and connect with my great aunt.",Ana,last_nights_dream
973,1196,,10/07/2020,07/10/2020 00:02,"I’m with my two kids and my ex. We are moving out of a high rise condo and back to our old house in Corvallis that has been rented for quite a bit of time. A lot has been moved around and changed in the Corvallis house. We get there and see that there’s a lot of clean up to do - a lot of stuff that needs to go to the trash. It feels weird and strange because I’m with my ex who I don’t really like and he’s been being an asshole for the last couple months. My focus and attention is on the kids. He’s sort of cleaning up. He left his computer there, which is weird. Some of the things in the house are things he actually left when we moved and somehow over the years of renting the house, those things stayed - for example his computer, computer speakers and other things. He’s gathering them all up and getting rid of them. There’s also stuff that the tenants left on top of the fridge. There’s a box of baseball gloves and underneath that is a box of mittens and stuff. I’m looking at all the curtains and see that they’re all the same curtains that had been there for years. I wonder if anybody has ever washed them. At one point, he goes outside with my son who is younger in this dream - maybe 4, 5 or 6. My ex is chopping down the fence in the backyard and there's this tree growing in the backyard which was not there originally. This is where the home deviates from the home in this reality. There’s a tree that he is chopping down as well as the fence. All of these fences are coming down. I’m glad for it because there’s more space and I like that it feels more open and spacious. But a part of me remembers when he put that fence up and now it’s interesting that he’s chopping it down. The inside of the house is getting uncluttered as I carry stuff out. Then our neighbor from across the street comes over and helps us move stuff out. One of the things she carries out is my daughter’s old desk - it’s an antique desk that we bought for her when she was little, but it’s a child’s desk and too small for her now. The neighbor moves it out and puts it on the street. I can see it through the windows of the house and it’s sitting on the corner with a free sign. The thought crosses my mind: “We paid a lot of money for that antique desk, maybe we should sell it on Craigslist.” But I’m just happy to have it out of the house and that more space is becoming available. The last thing I notice is a bed in the middle of the living room and the sheets are the old sheets we had before we moved. I’m thinking that a lot of people have slept on these sheets and it’s gross. The sheets and curtains - all these linens - are made of this bright yellow terry cloth material with a blue lace trim along the bottom. I made those a long time ago. I’m pulling them off to wash them or throw them away because they’ve been hanging up and lying on this bed for a really long time. Even though I made them, I don’t want to keep them because I have no idea who’s been sleeping on these sheets. I toss them. That feels good. The last little bit is when my ex comes back in from chopping down the fence and trees. I had seen his computer and wanted to get on the computer to do some research. I was like, “Oh, a computer. This is helpful. There’s lots of things I can do with this.” Instead of us working together to clean up, he gathers up all his stuff and is like, “This is mine.” He leaves with it. The tone of the dream changes from cooperative to him just taking what’s his and leaving. He leaves and the kids stay with me in the house.",Rose,last_nights_dream

It’s getting really late and it seems like I’ve been standing in line for a really long time. The line extends outside the bathroom doors and finally moves enough that I’m standing just inside. There are so many stalls and a few have open doors. When I peek in, I see women hovering their hands over the water, trying to cover what’s inside while waiting for the toilet to flush. I realize it’s taking so long because the toilets aren’t flushing properly. I step into a stall and squat and pee really fast then step out. A little while later, a woman goes into this stall and she’s disgusted because the seat is all wet. She steps out to get a towel to clean it up. I’m a bit ashamed, but I don’t think she knows I was the last person in that stall, and I also think it’s not pee, but rather splashback from a strong flush. Then we see another row of stalls - but it’s only changing rooms. Then somehow another row of stalls opens up and these have toilets. I’m trying to dressed for the event and realize it’s 11:30pm and my son is still awake! I give up trying to change because it’s just not working. I go find my family. They’re just playing, talking to people, laughing and having a good time. I’m surprised and think it’s maybe not as late as I thought it was. It’s only 6pm and we still have time to get my son home for bed. I’m relieved to see that my husband isn’t annoyed with me for taking so long. He seems understanding. The valet brings our car up.

979,1197,,11/07/2020,07/11/2020 00:04,"I’m in a house that doesn’t look anything like any I’ve been in before. It has two stories and there are carpeted stairs and there’s carpet upstairs. It reminds me very much of eighties and nineties cookie cutter houses as they were built and decorated with walnut railings. I’m walking up the stairs and the carpet is white. I walk into the bathroom and the bathroom is also white. It’s gigantic! The floor is all white tile, the walls are white, there are multiple windows you can see out and there’s a shower with glass doors all the way around. I’m there with two other female bodies and a male body. The women are practicing massage on the male body. There’s a huge white plastic sheet on the floor so the oil doesn’t spill everywhere. The man is lying down. All three of them are friends. I’m not really a friend or part of the group; I’m just an observer, but they know I’m there. I’m talking and interacting and learning. I’m listening to the two women. One has short dark almost black hair like a page boy cut almost to her shoulders. She’s teaching the other girl. There’s an air of learning happening. Even though the male body lying on the ground is volunteering to get the massage, he’s also learning as the massage is happening. He has short curly brown hair. The other woman has longer dirty blonde hair. The women are talking about anatomy and how you rub this way. Interspersed in their conversation is a lot of personal stuff like, “I drank too much last night. What’s going on with your boyfriend and your family?” The guy has basically fallen asleep on the floor until the woman with dark hair gets to his calves. She’s massaging his left calf and she massages it in a way that wakes the guy up. He’s in a lot of pain. He wakes up and sits up and says, “What were you talking about just then when you were massaging the leg?” It seems to be significant to him that what they were talking about would cause pain in his calf while they were massaging it. Then the black-haired woman is telling the other woman, “Okay, it’s your turn. You’ve gotta try.” I’m standing in the shower for all of this, looking through the glass. Every once in a while, I interject some commentary. I do have a little feeling of wanting to be included, which is why I’m adding things. They give me a cursory, “Yes, that’s right or correct,” or whatever. Then they go back to themselves. I need to learn, too. But the whole vibe feels strange - the entire dream feels as if everything is at an arm’s length and I feel like more the observer than a participant. The scene shifts and now I’m in a jungle, like a rainforest. I’m with a bunch of different people. I don’t know why they’re here. I know there are cows involved like they’re breeding or herding wild cattle so they don’t get eaten by wildcats. I’m watching them do this. There’s also a scientist around. I don’t know any of the people in this whole dream. There’s a road that leads into the jungle and T’s at a stop sign. You have to go right or left because if you go straight, you go through a retaining wall and off the side of the road and down into a ravine. People are having trouble with this stop sign. I’m watching. We’re being warned about the fierce bulls who need to be locked up and put in their pens, which are, oddly enough, closets and bathrooms. A lot of people are afraid of these bulls. I’m not afraid. When I see the bulls, I call them in, literally just with my words, my voice, my eyesight, my gaze and my presence. I completely tame these wild bulls and put them in their pens - their closets. The head scientist is very impressed with what I’m doing. Yet, I’m not part of this group. It’s like I’m behind the scenes putting the bulls in their pens. The people are grateful because they’re worried about the strength of these wild bulls and they don’t want these bulls mating with the cows for some reason. So they’re glad I’m doing this, but I’m somehow not part of the group and the learning. So as I’m putting the bulls in the pens I’m watching. The scientist is giving the group participants a little tab - it’s like ecstasy, but it’s not. It transports them to another reality. In this reality, these people are reliving what they did when they came to this T in the road. I’m watching as this one woman relives her whole experience. I hear her say to the scientist, “I had the scariest experience of coming into the jungle. Nothing that has happened once I got into the jungle even compares to what happened when I hit that stop sign, didn’t see it, barreled through the barricade and went over the edge into this ravine. I jumped out of my car and watched as my car fell down. I jumped and grabbed onto some vines to save myself and swing myself back onto the road. That was the most courageous thing I’ve done.” She’s telling and reliving the story because she’s in this alternate reality. The scientist says, “Yes, that was your most courageous moment. That was your biggest moment of this whole trip when you drove your car off the edge, jumped out of it and grabbed onto some vines and got yourself to safety.” I’m observing as each person tells a different story as they relive it through the tab of medicine. I see flashes of people climbing up this huge rocky hillside and that was their big thing. I also see a bus driver in a school bus blow through the stop sign and fall off into the ravine. I’m seeing these cranes hook the bus to lift it up out of the ravine, so the bus is hanging. I’m seeing these scary moments. I’m also seeing a person confront one of these bulls. It feels so weird for me because I’m not part of this dream in the way I usually am.",Rose,last_nights_dream

I was working on my unit but it was the future, I knew because the young social worker had a mustache and it was turning gray. He poked his head around the door and said, “we have more coming; we have to make room.” All of us, even the patients that could, made room for more beds. We lined the beds up so close to each other with no dividers and no rooms anymore, just beds next to each other and we turned the hallway into a unit. It was still the psych unit though. Some of my long stay patients were still there and one of them from a previous dream was in a wheelchair and these doctors came to see him but they hadn’t aged. They were like, “get up and walk,” and he did, but he was so tiny, like a little old man boy. He had stopped talking. There were mostly men on the unit, only a few women. One of the women was maybe a social worker from a place I used to work but she was getting admitted to our unit (not happening in real life) and she was angry, she was like, “you’re gonna have to make me walk through that door!” The security guard Arshis kept asking me if I was okay, something he’s been doing in real life lately because there has been a real threat to me on the unit. There was something unsafe outside like a war zone or something and we were living and working there.

I’m not going to participate in this.” The store is pretty crowded and people are witnessing this conversation. I push the cart towards him in a very “fuck you’ish” way and walk out past the cash registers and out the sliding doors and out into the parking lot. There are cars in the parking lot. It’s still pretty dark outside. I just leave. I’m so mad, but I’m very clear that I’m not taking anymore of his bullshit. I’m not playing his game. I’m not doing it his way.",Rose,last_nights_dream

We were going fishing and recording it for the project. It was super successful, I caught a huge king salmon (pink) and then we began to fall in love. It was a difficult experience as I had never gone fishing and the waters were rough and it was cold at night. And we had a spark and we made love and that scenario played out. We did our film project and it got chosen to move to the best next round and eventually we were chosen to make a feature film based on our short film. A year went by and we were such a great team and so in love. And then all of a sudden I woke up so cold (in the dream still) and my husband was laughing at me and we were on the boat (which was normal since we were always fishing now). He was being cruel and I was confused and asked him why he was sleeping so far away from me and he was repulsed and offended. I started crying and asking for my phone and he said it fell in the water last night. I was frantic and nothing felt right. He said that we got what we needed, we got the king salmon and the footage and we should go back now that I was awake. He didn’t comfort me. I said, “what happened to us?” and he said there never was an us? I kept repeating all the things that had happened in the last year and he told me I was crazy and it’s only been one night and he could never love someone like me. I started eating a bunch of crackers, stuffing my face and they were so dry and impossible to swallow and I was just sobbing when I realized that the last year of my life hadn’t happened at all.",Tita,last_nights_dream
992,885,,15/07/2020,07/15/2020 00:02,"This is the last scene of the dream: I’m walking around the house with my mom to check on the snake again. The snake is a huge anaconda/boa constrictor and she lives under the outside shed that is raised just enough above the ground. We see little garter snakes eating acorns in their mouths. We see mice nibbling acorns. We see a white fuzzy frog with an acorn in her mouth. The anaconda/boa constrictor is out in the open, she’s coiled and folded up on herself. She usually leaves us alone and we leave her alone. A bobcat is sleeping on her. My mom and I have been close to this snake before. We step closer and see creatures sleeping in her folds - more mice and little frogs. I don’t know why, but I start poking the snake with my snow shovel. As I do this, the bobcat shifts slightly to the side, but continues to sleep. I see two baby snakes swaying their heads in the dark shadow beneath the bobcat and in the coils of their mama, the giant boa. She starts to move and unwind. We realize our mistake. The bobcat stretches and looks at us - she walks towards us. We realize we need to move fast. But my mom can’t move well because she has hurt her knee and ankle in waking life and she’s still recovering. I’m worried for her. We do get away. The bobcat and the big snake are both coming after us. My mom runs around the house. I run towards a high fence and scramble up it. I straddle the fence and see a ladder on the other side. All the creatures below are really active. I’m frightened and trying to decide whether I should be loud and wake up the teacher and other students in the house - the teacher’s room is right there on the second floor. I think we should maybe handle this on our own, but the animals are making a lot of noise below. Ted’s room is on this side as well. Earlier in the dream, he was in a room with the teacher, me and another person. We were doing a healing of some kind. Whenever Ted opened the door to let the people in and out, he used a cotton handkerchief to wipe the doorknobs off each time they were touched.",Ana,last_nights_dream

It’s definitely twilight into nighttime. I don't know why we’re all there. The energetic feeling is heavy. Some of us are sitting in chairs, some are standing. We’re milling about like at a party. The mood is somber. I’m wondering why we’re all sad, I don’t get it and don’t see a need or reason for us to be this way. I make a decision to cheer everybody up. It’s a little scary for me to make this decision because now I know I need to put myself out there. I start making jokes. I don’t know what the jokes are about. I feel myself try one joke with a bit of trepidation to see if people will laugh, and they do. I get a little bolder and continue to make situational jokes using things that are happening in the moment and pointing out the environment and saying funny things. People are laughing and the whole mood of the dream changes from this really dark, heavy, somber mood. It doesn’t get all the way happy, but there is a relief with laughter.

994,1408,,15/07/2020,07/15/2020 00:04,"“The Television Show” I’m in the house of my daughter’s grandparents, both of whom have crossed over. The house doesn’t look exactly like the house they used to live in, but I know it’s their house. I’m in it and I can feel the air has a different quality - it’s light and has particles in it, it’s as though I am standing in front of a window and can see light streaming in with particles floating in it. It’s so light and bright. The house is empty but it feels like there’s a presence in the light. Gradually Roberta and Tom appear. They look just like they did when I met them. Tom is busy with a project. He’s making something outside - he’s building something. Roberta is inside. She’s putting something together with her hands. One of her daughters appears and she’s laughing and joking. She’s, in a loving way, mocking what her mom is doing. Then they ask me if I would be involved with this project. I ask what it is that they’re doing. They say they’re creating hairstyles for people that are going to be on the television show. I realize that there’s a producer involved that’s giving some of the instructions, but I can’t see him and they’re just making reference to him. Roberta and Tom have a lot of autonomy. Someone is just doing the filming. I agree to do part of the hairstyles. They’re putting the styles together on paper first, but not as a drawing - it’s a standout relief like you’d make a sculpture - only they’re doing it with bits and pieces of things to create a finished product that is a hairstyle. There are all kinds of stuff woven into the hairstyles as if it’s been upcycled out of bits of ribbon, yarn and human hair. It’s colorful and unique in a way that I’ve never thought of before. It’s actually coming out more like a headdress which makes sense because they are Native North American. Then Tom comes in from outside and he’s washing his hands because he’s been making some kind of vehicle, some kind of car. I don’t see what he’s doing, though. He says he’s about finished and his part is ready to go. We say that we’re ready to do the headdress. We share a meal and then the producer comes and films Tom’s part outside first. Someone else is following the prototype headdresses we created and implementing it. We’re returning the camaraderie, laughing and joking. At one point, Roberta is saying something to me and her daughter is standing right behind me and making remarks like, “Oh sure sure,” really close to my ear. Roberta says, “What are you saying?” Her daughter won’t repeat it. I think that I don’t like being a vessel for this. Then the producer comes in and asks us if we would like to preview the movie. Everybody says yes. We go to the living room and the lights are dimmed somehow - this is weird because there are no lights in the house, only the heavily particled lightness. But it does dim so we can see a movie projected onto the wall. The opening credits go up showing the background parts that everyone did - creative direction, innovation, etc.. Then, it’s like there’s a screen that comes up with Tom’s car. I realize the movie is about the making of it. I’m astonished at the innovation that has been put into this vehicle. It’s similar to the headdresses we developed. His vehicle is made out of so many different things. It doesn’t look junky, though, it looks really sophisticated, polished and well integrated. In fact, you wouldn’t even know it’s a vehicle when you first look at it. There are so many different things in it. It definitely looks metal, but when you look, you can see pieces that form the finished metal but aren’t metal. They’ve got this upcycled feel to it, but in a highly sophisticated and finished product.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

There are four other roommates and they’re all men and they’re really rowdy. It’s nighttime and also bedtime, so I’m trying to sleep. All of the beds are in the living room; it’s not like we have separate bedrooms to go to. The dudes are all wired, they’re totally super high energy. But I’m super tired and wanting to go to sleep. Connie is wanting to go to sleep. She’s kind of fussing over me, trying to make sure I’m okay. The guys are bouncing around the living room, fighting and wrestling with each other and getting kind of nasty and obnoxious and drinking. I’m trying to fall asleep on my bed. Even though it’s my apartment and my place of rest, I feel like a guest, especially with the way Connie is fussing over me and making sure I have all the things I need. She’s going out of her way to explain the other roommates’ behavior. They’re like, “Yeah, Rose, we see you, we see you’re sleeping, but we can’t help ourselves, so you’re just going to have to deal with it.” There’s an air of “tough shit.” I’m lying down and next to my bed is a screen that separates my bed from all the other beds. It’s a light colored pine wooden screen with slats. I get a phone call from James, one of my roommates from this dream. In real life James is a friend of a friend who I just went camping with. I like him a lot - he’s a very soft spoken person and in his day job he works with conflict resolution and has the biggest heart and is so kind. In the dream, he’s calling me to check up on me and make sure I’m okay with all the noise and violence. There’s an undercurrent of violence and threat of sexual harassment. I’m like, “Not really. I don’t feel comfortable or safe to sleep, that’s for sure.” The dream shifts out of this flat and goes outside. It’s still dark outside - this eerie green darkness that comes before a thunderstorm or tornado. I can see James in the distance and he’s with other people.

We’re in an urban setting and we’re just walking. We’re walking in solitude. It’s a long walk. I can feel the fatigue in my legs.

Debra is there, as are some other people. I start to wash the dishes - there’s a massive pile of them; they’re all over the kitchen counter. I reach for the plug. It’s really quite disgusting, the amount of soggy food bits as no one has emptied the plug or drain out for some time. So I have to dig around to find the plug and I’m scooping out bits of soggy food and putting it in the garbage. I wash a few dishes then someone has set up to dry them - I think it’s Debra. The pile is too big and I have to wait to wash some more, so I leave the kitchen and go down the hallway, which is now a different hallway; the house has shifted.

I wonder, “Hmm, it doesn’t seem to be afraid of me.” It’s a big rabbit.

I stand on the bed because I want to see what the other characters are. There is a Bugs Bunny and another one that’s red and another one that’s purple. I’m starting to see that what I first thought were Disney characters are not; they’re a combination of animals and mythological creatures. Each one is very unique. I think that it's curious.

I drove to my next therapy appointment which was in a remote location off of a highway outside of town. It was in a large complex which I entered with some trepidation. There was a large open reception area with a marble floor. I approached the receptionist and was directed to the therapist, a tall, bald middle-aged man. I was suspicious of the place and the therapist from the start. During our session, he tried to convince me of a whole host of problems which I did not have. At first I was confused, but quickly figured out he was trying to trick me and convince me that I had to stay there long-term. I wasn't sure what their intentions were but they couldn't be good.  I disagreed about my problems but they insisted that I would have to stay there for some time. They took me to my room and had me lie down in my bed as they left and shut the door, leaving two guards stationed outside. As I lay down, I realized that I had been drugged as I was unable to move my legs. I determined that they had drugged me when they have given me something to drink and that the purpose of this drug was to prevent me from being able to walk and find a route of escape at night as the building was not that secure.  I decided to wait for nightfall and see if I could move at all. I found that the drug wasn't nearly as powerful as they had intended and I was able to move my legs and walk to some extent. I debated whether or not I should turn the light on in my room. I wasn't sure whether it would be better to escape in the dark in hopes that the guards would not see me or if I should turn on the lights so that I would better be able to find my way out of the room. In the end, I left the lights off and determined to be as quiet as possible.  I found that the window at the far end of the room could be opened. It was a tall, heavy white wooden window with square window panes. I opened it up just enough to squeeze through only to find that I was on the second floor.

In this dream he was happy and joyful and flirty, and grown up like he had aged. It was a very sweet energy. I woke up and felt a little sad actually.

I was letting my little dog Pinto out to pee on the balcony grass pad and Pinto scared me because he was trying to get through the balcony bars. In real life I have a safety clear plastic guard so he can’t. Two things happened in the dream- one was Pinto went over before I could get him, I was frozen in place and my stomach dropped and I just watched him fall. I remember knowing there was nothing I could do to save him so I took a breath and wished him well “thank you, may you be safe, may you be free from your body, may you know peace, thank you” and Rory was crazy all riled up like, “how did you let this happen!” The second part of the dream was I just imagined the part where he fell, but I told Rory he did to get a reaction out of him, and then I ran and scooped him up and cuddled him and brought him back to the couch. The area on the balcony was gray, like white cloudy gray fog, you couldn’t see up or down or anything else.",Vera,last_nights_dream2

She’s made a remake on line 13 that she links should be different. She thinks $54 is way too much for sour cream. I look and see that it was actually $54 for sour cream, artisan bread and other food items to make a nice meal. Every interaction with her in reviewing the invoice is extremely awkward. There’s another dream where we’re looking at a house. I’m not sure if it’s for sale or a possible place to rent. My son is running around the backyard and my husband is looking around. They come inside and tell me that behind the corner is a lot of dirt with a broken down tractor, chickens and rusted car parts like a pick and pull.

This woman had to be the driver and it was like these go-karts on a roller coaster almost and we went straight at first and then we made a turn and she was like “oh shit” and we had to go completely vertical and we did.

1018,1411,,19/07/2020,07/19/2020 00:02,"“Mayoral Politic” This dream is more of a thematic than a narrative. It looked like one of those old fashioned great big signs when you enter a town where it has the mayor’s face on it, then a story about the town. It was like a threshold or portal or lived experience rather than just a great big giant sign. It looked old, too, it had an oval shape to the story, the painted picture of the mayor was in the upper left hand side. I’m looking at a description, but it’s also an entry into a town. So it’s not two-dimensional. On the description is a comparison of a mayor and the lifestyle of someone involved in a subculture and has a motorcycle. The mayor is female. She looks like she’s had a life of outdoors - there’s a sun-kissed color to her skin. She has short blonde wavy and dense hair. She looks like she would be a muscular person even though the picture only has her face. The description is like a political analysis of someone who is mayor of a town and removed from that duty that caters to the idea of mayor but stays in the office and doesn’t really interact - maybe like how clueless the aristocracy was to the plight of the common people. So it’s a comparison between mayoral duties that are detached and removed from what people need as opposed to someone who is more rebellious of that polite culture, rides a motorcycle, but is simultaneously responsive to the needs of the town and then is praised. But the praise is lie: despite the fact that there is a motorcycle, there is a number of positive qualities that the mayor has. It’s not two-dimensional in that I’m reading this. I’m feeling it as a lived experience in my body when these two descriptions are compared and contrasted. It’s like an entryway into that experience. I consider them from how my body feels about them, then decide that I would rather live in a place with a mayor that rides a motorcycle and is somewhat rebellious but responsive, than the mayor that caters to polite society but is cluelessly privileged.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I think I’ve dreamt about them before running. This dream was both flashing back to the work on something that looked like present day and then flashing to a memory reel, some of it like old pictures. The current flash was this embodied sense of hard work - we were working with a group of people on these box cars to outfit them for something; there was conflict and confusion amongst us but out in the world there was war. We had to work stealth and fast, always at night and these boxcars had to be undetected. The flash to the scenes with the daughter haunt me. I can almost hear her voice and she’s talking about going to New York City and riding around in the backs of trucks and the image is the mother and daughter in a black and white picture in the back of an old truck holding onto a mattress and the narrator is talking about letting her daughter decide where to go and zooming in on the daughter’s face smiling but it’s sad and creepy feeling like something bad happened to the daughter and it just made me want to turn my light on as I write this.

It was a big room with 4 bunk beds and a bathroom and a big recreation area. Everyone was nice. They wouldn’t let me have my phone though and I was freaking out because I wanted to call someone familiar. I had a panic attack and fell over to the ground and froze up - couldn’t move, couldn’t talk. After a few minutes I could move but still not talk. They didn’t believe me - thought I was making it up even though I wasn’t speaking correctly. I asked to go to the hospital but they wouldn’t take me. I couldn’t talk for a long time. Fast forward a few years and I had a boyfriend and was close with my new sisters. We went to a museum and there was a reptile exhibit. I saw a giant rattlesnake and was super drawn to it. It was shaped like a square instead of a round body. Was very weird. The cage was slightly open. When everyone left the room I wanted to pet it. When I did, it latched on and bit the shit out of me, I ripped it off and it bit me again and again on each hand and foot. It was really painful. I ran out and told everyone I’d gotten bit and needed an antivenom. I wasn't panicked or scared, mostly ashamed. My mom gave me an address of a doctor nearby the house who had some antivenom. We all went but only I got out of the car. When I went in, it was like a circus/bazaar. Super colorful and loud and mystical. Someone helped me right away with all the wounds and asked about my two spirits. After I was treated I felt better and the band of Gypsies who were Aida and Aharon and others who invited us to join their party and they had a hot spring we soaked in and aerial performances and things.

1030,1202,,21/07/2020,07/21/2020 00:03,"It’s definitely another university setting with all college age or older students. I’m wandering around. There are shops across the street from the university - your typical coffee shop and bagel shop and all the things that college students eat. It’s not as dark as previous dreams, but there are clouds and it’s a little grey, raining and drizzly. I’m going in and out of groups and shops. I’m not with anyone or part of any group. I keep seeing people I know. I wander into someplace - I can't tell if it’s a shop or someone’s home. There are a bunch of people sitting at a long dining table eating. I talk with them for a bit. It could have been a restaurant, but I’m not sure. I leave and walk out. I’m walking downhill on this cobblestone street. I’m walking on the sidewalk and passing by some shops. I see some people who remind me of the manager at the grocery store and her kids and partner. I’m hovering - I’m there but not - and have a sense that I want to be invited, but they don’t see me. They’re coming out of a shop onto this sidewalk. I don’t know why I’m standing there, but I’m waiting to engage or be engaged by them, but they’re not seeing me. It’s almost like I’m a ghost. I finish walking down this street. At the end of the street is water and a pier. I don’t know if it’s a lake or the ocean. There’s also a wine and cheese food truck. I walk down to it. It’s all outdoors. As I’m walking into the courtyard I see the area with the cheese. The cheeses are all stacked on each other and the names are written on a piece of plywood. You can reach into cubby holes and grab out a piece of cheese. The cheese has to be cold, so I guess this is a wood front to the cooler. I’m looking at this and talking to someone - the dairy freezer manager from the grocery store. I’m telling them, “Yes, this cheese is great and this cheese is great” because I know all about the cheeses. They ask me which one I want, but I tell them I’m not going to get any of them because I’m allergic to cheese. A few steps down I see crates and barrels of wine that are labeled. But if you want your wine, you have to go up to the counter. There are people sitting at the counter on stools. They’ve gotten their cheese and now they’re at the wine bar ordering wine. I’m just watching people have fun. The person who is with me says, “We actually have work to do.” There are things that need scrubbing on a bunch of sawhorses. There’s a hose right there. She says, “I have all these things I have to clean.” I say, “Well, I’m not doing anything and no one can see me in this dream anyway, so I’ll help you clean these things.” So we’re scrubbing containers and tubs. I’m doing all the scrubbing and she’s just kind of standing there telling me her stories of woe. She’s really sad. I’m trying not to get wet with the hose and trying not to get her wet. She helps me turn the containers and get the water out, but isn’t doing a whole lot. She’s talking a lot telling me her troubles and life issues with her and her girlfriend. I’m not having feelings about it or attachment in any way. I’m just doing the motions. There’s no resentment. It feels fine to listen to her. The whole dream feels a bit out of reach - a bit removed and in the mists, but I do have an awareness that things are being rearranged in my head or psyche.",Rose,last_nights_dream
1031,1412,,21/07/2020,07/21/2020 00:04,"“The ATM” I’m in a lineup in the bank. My son is with me. I’ve got cash and gift cards to deposit. I’m twelfth in line and when I get to be second in line, I start to organize my piles of cash and gift cards. I realize that I cannot find my bank card, although I know it’s in my purse. So I’m disorganized and have too many things in my hands and there is too much stuff in my wallet that is not a bank card. As I’m trying to juggle all these different piles of things, I now become the first person in line and it’s my turn. I still can’t find my bank card. I say to the couple behind me - a man and a woman who appear to know each other and have been chatting happily the whole time - “I need to set my stuff down on the floor. I can’t find my bank card. I know it’s here. Feel free to go ahead.” They do and I can still hear them chatting happily with each other. I’ve spread everything out on the floor and sort through them. I’ve got envelopes opened with bills I’ve looked at and returned. There are things from my son’s birthday party. There are gift cards for McDonald’s that I know we’ll never use because we don’t eat there, but we can deposit them into our bank account. I finally locate my bank card. Every time I thought I located my bank card, I would look at it and it was a replica of a bank card but wasn’t a bank card. It keeps getting into the pile of things to deposit into the ATM by accident because it looks so much like a bank card but it’s not one. Although when I’m finally read to make my deposit, the couple that was chatting happily has gone and there are different people who are ready to have their turn. I walk up with my son and say to the person who’s next: “I’ve been looking for my bank card and have already been waiting in this line. Is it okay if I go next?” They’re quite happy to let me go. I get there and the screen is like an electronic game board - like “Snakes and Ladders” or “Game of Life” or “Mouse Trap” or one of those really colorful game boards for kids with lights and red, green and yellow. I try to put my bank card in and realize it’s this dummy bank card again. I pull it out and am trying to sift through. I have different deposits in between each finger and thumb as if my hand is a categorized sorter. I know I’m taking a really long time. The bank machine spits out the pseudo bank card. I ask my son if he’ll hold a couple things. I’m still trying to get the bank card. I turn around and explain to the person behind me: “I’m really sorry. The machine keeps rejecting my card.” Then, I locate the real bank card and put it in. Now it’s asking me to select from one of the buttons underneath if I want to deposit gift cards. The button is really tiny. There are three buttons you can press and they’re all really close together. I keep trying to push the one button. Finally it works. Every time you push a button, a whole bunch of other things light up on this screen. There are pictures of circus people and they aren’t just pictures, they’re animated parts that are moving. I get the gift card thing to work and insert them one at a time. On the screen, which is quite large - probably 12x12 - it’s like a record of your deposits and says exactly what you deposited and how much the gift card was worth. So I’m feeding four gift cards in. Then it tells me what bills I need to pay. I had the bills all organized. You have to push each bill into the machine to pay your bills. I think I’m almost done when the bank teller comes out with three big boxes of past records of bill payments. I’m unprepared to deal with all of this. I finish my transaction and allow the ATM to return my card so someone else can have their turn. I thank the person behind me for waiting patiently. Then I look at what's in these boxes. It is my whole life, everywhere I’ve lived, as if the bank has kept records of this and it’s all in the boxes and sorted sequentially in years and months in a proper sorting job. All of these envelopes have been opened with transaction receipts that are on letterhead folded in threes and put back in the envelope and sorted chronologically. It goes all the way back through every relationship I’ve ever had prior to my daughter’s birth with all the different houses I’ve lived in, everywhere I’ve traveled. I think that I’ve taken care of this. I’ve paid my taxes. I didn’t even know there were records that this stuff existed. I decide to just shred them and not even attempt to go through all these boxes and take everything out to look at it. I’m done with that. I’m good. I pick the boxes up. I walk around the giant line of people waiting for the ATM. I notice the material of the floors and walls. I notice the architecture of the building. Everything is made of marble. Feet click on the marble. It’s very ostentatious, yet it is quite simple. I guess it’s like an expensive institution style architecture without a lot of external trappings; it’s all straight and linear, boxed. The ceiling, however, is really high. I’m standing at the teller waiting to say that these things need to be shredded. I see the woman who was part of the couple chatting happily. She’s telling one of the tellers that now there is a hot studio on the top floor of this building. She’s pretty happy about this and she’s going to go up there and try it. I think to myself, “Wow, that seems odd that there would be a hot yoga studio on the twelfth floor of a bank institution.” I watch her go upstairs. She’s dressed really colorfully. She’s wearing a tan mini skirt and bright pink jacket that almost meets the hem of the mini skirt. I watch her walk up the stairs. The teller takes my boxes. I say, “Please just shred these.” Then I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I notice some are high school classmates, others are Stanford classmates and others are people I camped with at and saw at Burning Man. It’s morning now. There is a delay or some confusion. Someone who poses as a director or manager of the household tells us that the regularly scheduled meditation isn’t happening. I realize this is an ashram or co-op. She looks at me as if I were the one who was supposed to teach. I look at the schedule and see that I’m to teach a yoga class. I find a former high school classmate, Fiona, to co-teach with me. She’s a bit surprised because she is a new teacher, but agrees. She gets the music together and begins the class. Then I step in. My voice is too quiet and I can’t get my volume up to fill this big room. Mats are scattered in disarray and people are clustered close together. Ted is on his mat and I see other former yoga students who I recognize. But, the class is starting late and I think I’m going to miss my hair appointment. Somebody notices that I’m walking around on my toes. She calls me over and tells me about some poses to take care of that. I realize that I have really high dural tension and am quite stressed but pretending not to be. I also realize that the students are quite knowledgeable and aren’t really taking the class to learn from me, but to support a colleague and enjoy the day’s programs. I do some of the practices she tells me and it helps. Then I practice along with the class because it no longer makes sense to hold a teacher role apart from the students. We find out while I’m teaching that there was a delay with the hair stylist. I do hope I can still have my hair done in time. She shows up right at 11 and I’m waiting at the couches - I’ve just decided to pass the class onto Fiona. The director tells me I must get in line and give her my card. I get in line and take out my card. My card is unreadable, so I’m causing a further delay and am feeling bad about adding to the confusion. Finally my card reads and I let someone else go ahead of me to get her hair done. When it’s my turn, she does my hair, but I cannot remember anything special about it. Then I’m chosen to help out with an underserved community of children with their after school program. This is my first day. I’m in a car with a few other people. It feels a bit like San Francisco. We get lost in the streets and have a hard time finding a parking spot. We finally do and we go in. I realize I’m being tested for a job. I feel really uncomfortable in this situation and it doesn’t feel like my work in any way. I tell the woman in charge that I don’t want to do it anymore and I’m not going to come back. She says, “Well, Geri has hand chosen me to do this. If I do this, then I have the privilege of traveling with her to all of her events as part of her close inner circle.

There’s a main house and a secondary building that is smaller and looks like a single-wide, slanted with one side taller than the other. The taller side of this building is all sliding glass windows and you can see into it. The land has eucalyptus trees and a mango tree. It looks kind of tropical but also like California, desert with a lot of oak trees. I’m with my family - my dad, mom and siblings - and other people who I don’t recognize, but have the sense they are ancestors. It’s a gathering. The focus is on this little house with all the sliding doors and glass windows. I can see into it and there are Persian rugs all over and couches. The other house is a grand house that’s very well appointed, while this house is more humble with a small kitchen off to the left and a bath. I don’t see any beds, but my dad is telling me that he and friends have stayed there and really liked sleeping there. I can see a fireplace. But I have no idea where they sleep. I see a dining room table and chairs and a couple couches, but again, no beds. I’m like, “Where are you all sleeping? There are no beds and no place to sleep.” This house is definitely a focus for the moment. Parts of it need fixing up. It doesn’t have plumbing and they’re planning on putting plumbing in it. Me and my dad and at least a few other people are gathered around the house and looking at it and talking about it. Then, the scene changes.

At first he starts out really bitter and sullen, but then his demeanor changes as he spends time in the pool. I’m in the pool with them and I can see him do his exercises. They’re at one end of the pool and he’s swimming back and forth to the wall. He reminds me of my brother, too - it’s like he’s switching back and forth. He regains full use of his body and gets out of the pool. Then the Rock shows up. I’m following along with all of this, but can’t tell if I’m actually in the dream or just observing. They climb into a helicopter. There’s one other person who shows up, but I can’t remember who it is, although it’s some movie star. They climb into the helicopter and I’m afraid that the helicopter isn’t balanced and if we all get in, it’s going to tip backwards and fall off the ledge it’s perched on. The helicopter is all black on the outside. There’s also a dog. The Rock is the pilot. Keanu Reeves is in the helicopter and ready for an action adventure mission. Then the third person has also climbed in. My fear is that they’re going to tip over backwards because the helicopter is sitting on a ledge - it’s not on a super stable helipad. I’ve followed them into the cockpit but don’t know if I’m really there because I don’t have a place to sit and no one is addressing me. They’re all healthy and ready to go. I’m hearing mission kind of music playing in my head, so it’s really like a movie. They’re going to take off. I think I go with them, but I can’t remember. Below us is a bunch of water - it’s like a cliff face with rocks and ocean down below.",Rose,last_nights_dream
1035,1413,,22/07/2020,07/22/2020 00:03,"“High School, Again” The dream starts off and I’m in something that looks like a school. It’s quite a big building with a couple floors and has the feel of a high school. There are lockers lining the hallways. It’s the expanded version of high school but doesn’t look like the one I went to - it just represents high school. In one of the rooms, there are four large round tables, but they’re really low to the floor like you’d see in a daycare. There are chairs around the tables. There’s a bathtub with a shower curtain pulled across it on one side. Across the hall from this room - and the hall is lined with lockers - is a doorway that leads into my apartment. All I see of my apartment is just the one room you enter. So as you open the door, it goes into a living area. There is some living room furniture like a couch and a couple other chairs for single people, some end tables and lamps. There’s a closet with a cheap sliding door where coats are hung. It does look like there’s a kitchen off to the right although I do not enter it in my dream. In my dream I leave my apartment, walk across the hall and see that people are starting to gather around the tables. I see a couple friends from high school. I’m still friends with one of them even though she’s moved quite a distance away. It doesn’t feel like it’s been a long time because we do message on Facebook. She stands up and I give her a hug. Then we both sit down at the table. I’m having trouble fitting my adult size body under the table - my knees don’t fit under because the table and chairs are so low. I kind of sit sideways to the table and rest my elbows on the top. Then I see another person that I haven’t seen since high school. She moved right out of high school and she and her husband live out west. I’m really happy to see her and give her a big hug. She says, “Oh my goodness, that was a really strong hug.” She’s laughing and I’m laughing, too. I tell her that I’ve been working out and my arms are strong. There’s some kind of job that I’m to start in February that requires upper body strength. I say, “It hasn’t always been like this, but I really wanted the job. So in November I started lifting weights with my arms. Good thing it’s only December! If this were February, I might have squeezed you harder!” She laughs. We sit down at the table. Again, it’s hard for me to get my legs under, so I sit sideways with my elbows on the table. Other people join us. We’ve taken out our lunch and are eating a little and chatting with light-hearted humor. I notice behind me that there’s a different group of people starting to assemble at the other round table. I notice Lisa - the friend who betrayed our friendship. She also betrayed her own brother’s wife. It’s the brother’s wife’s friends that are starting to gather at the table behind me. I’m aware of this out of my peripheral vision. Then I need to go into the washroom, so I excuse myself and get up from the table. I go to the bathtub with shower curtain. I’m not having a shower. I don’t remember using the toilet or sink. I just go in and pull the shower curtain across. I’m in there for a few minutes then come out again. Now I see that Lisa is sitting at the table with her brother’s wife’s friends. They all have stony looks on their faces. She has her arms folded over her chest. I think, “Ugh, why is she even sitting there? I wonder what’s going on with that. They look so awkward and agitated.” But I’m glad she didn’t sit down with my friends. I don’t want to interact with her. I’m hoping as I walk back to my table that she won’t look at me. She doesn’t, which is good, and I sit back down with my friends. Then, we’re finishing our lunch and it’s time to go somewhere else. Everyone else in the room has cleared, including Lisa. There’s only one person left at the table where I was sitting and I’m wanting to clean it up. There are rolls of paper towels which actually look like toilet paper rolls. I think, “Well, that’s a good idea to cut paper towel rolls in half because people only normally need a little bit anyway.” I remove a couple pieces and wipe up the table. Then I take the rest of the paper towel which is now opened. I set it in front of my apartment door. I’m tidying up and putting everything away. At this point, a few people start coming back into the room. It’s all clean and lunch has been put away. Somebody says, “Where are all the paper towels?” As I’m about to indicate that I’ve put everything away, there’s a rumor flying around the room. The rumor is an embodiment of itself where it’s like there’s more than one voice talking at once. I can hear phrases like, “Who would take all the paper towels? Why are there no paper towels? Has anyone reported this?” I think, “Wh? Was there supposed to be a lot of paper towels in here?” I’m about to indicate that there were no other paper towels in here and I have a roll right there, but all these rumors with false information got together and now there were supposed to have been three boxes of paper towels lined up against the wall and they’re all missing. The janitor is going to be upset. I say to someone, “Well why doesn’t someone ask the janitor if there’s supposed to be three boxes here? Ask where they’re supposed to be kept. There’s no point getting all upset about this.” Then I point with my finger and say, “Look! There’s a partial half roll right there. Let’s use that for what we need and then go and retrace the steps of where these have all gone.” Nobody is listening. Then I see Lisa look at it. She’s adding to the rumor that I’ve stolen all the paper towels. I’m trying to explain to people that I just cleaned up and wiped up all the tables. I put the half roll in front of the door because I didn't know where it went and didn’t want to leave it on the center of the table. No one is really focused on any one certain thing and no one is asking the janitor where they’re supposed to be or if in fact any are missing at all. Maybe he hasn’t brought them up for the day.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I ran after the ball and swatted it back up in the air, but it's trajectory was still toward the river. I hit the ball again and this time it soared through the village and landed near Dorian.

I was trying to get in the smaller of the two spaces that I work in. Two of my coworkers open the door. They were cleaning it and there was graffiti all over the walls and somebody had broken in and written all over the walls. I’m trying to review what it looks like but the writing was blue and purple I think it says something like “jeer.” And then I went to the other room with my coworker and there were people cleaning the room. We said hello and tried to jump on a phone call. The computer didn’t work so we were trying to use our phones and I felt like we were early but we were not and when we finally got on, the Meeting was ending. Then I walked back to the smaller office and realized there was a fence around the door. He turned around and one of the patients that should’ve been on the locked side was loose on my unlocked voluntary unit side. He was slamming and checking me against the fence and very physical. Security came and instead of taking him away, they kept body checking him over into the fence where I was against the fence and then eventually throwing him over on top of me. And when I walked out I suddenly didn’t have shoes on and I saw the security person from far away - not the one who was just body checking the guy against the fence but a different one. He didn’t help me but he looked concerned that he was pretty far away so I started walking towards the building where they were. I was confused and scared and felt exposed.",Vera,last_nights_dream

1040,891,,23/07/2020,07/23/2020 00:03,"I’m in a little town, in and out of small groups of people. We’re told it’s going to rain tonight, so we’re coming up with a plan of whether to stay or go. Some of the people live here and others of us are just visiting. A couple of my patients (lesbian women partners) have a room here and they also have a roommate. They show me their apartment and it’s quite interesting. We walk in through the door and the king sized bed is right there. There’s a kitchen and laundry room off to the side and an additional bedroom for the roommate to the right behind a curtain. The roommate comes and they show me around. Somehow I know that Liam is there. I have a flash of having seen him earlier in the morning. Now it’s getting towards evening. I am with another person - sometimes the person is a woman and sometimes the person is a man. We meet up with Liam in the hallway of the hotel. He wants to take us to his rooms and show us where he’s been staying. It’s not so easy to get to his rooms. He takes us down the hallway, down a back set of stairs, and across another hallway. We’re on the floor just below the ground where the windows are just above the ground. We come to his rooms, but we can’t enter from the hallway. So we have to go through the brothers’ room next door. This room is where five men are staying. He knocks on the door and we walk through. The men are all hanging around on couches watching a show, probably a sports show. One man has a girlfriend and she’s watching me as if I don’t belong. We pass through a door and down a short hallway to Liam’s room. He opens the door and there’s a naked woman wrapped up in a white sheet as if she’s just been ravished in the morning and sleeping all day. At first I think it’s his wife and am thinking I should leave. But then she rolls over. She’s a very tiny Asian woman. I guess they’ve been practicing tantric sex secrets and she has a book. There’s an invitation for all of us to be together. She instructs us. We all look at each other. Liam and I lock eyes and nod. He leans towards the man first as if inviting him in, but then the magnetism between us is too strong and he leans into me. We feel so good together, rolling around the bed. I want to stay in his embrace. It feels so right and natural. I want to remember this feeling.",Ana,last_nights_dream
1041,1204,,23/07/2020,07/23/2020 00:04,"I’m in a shower stall with Ana. I can’t remember if our clothes are on or off. We’re trying to get the temperature of the water right. Ana is asking me about getting things right in general. I’m looking at her like, “I don’t know. We’re just kind of winging it.” I wish I could remember more, but there’s the feeling between us where Ana is feeling a little bit of despair. We never leave the shower. But Ana ends up in a place of acceptance that the work she is doing is indeed and in fact good enough and we can only do the best we can do. Then the scene changes. I’m with my siblings. We’re all in a big house together and it’s all of them - my five brothers and my sister - and my mom and dad. We’re just living life. At one point there are all these blueberries on the kitchen table to be eaten. The kitchen table is a long table that sits about twelve and it’s just covered in blueberries. We’re munching on them. We’re all coming and going. At one point we all pile into a van. My brother is going to drive. This annoys me because I get carsick with the way he drives - he’s not a very smooth driver. So I’m not excited to be a passenger in the car with him. But he’s so fucking stubborn about being the one to drive that it’s not worth arguing, so we all just let him drive all the time. Then the scene changes again. We’re in a house of some sort but I don’t recognize it and I don’t know who it belongs to. There are other people here and we’re all gathered for a wedding. I’m talking to the parents of the bride or groom. The dad looks like an actor - white dude, older - and he’s making popcorn. He pours the popcorn in the popcorn maker but there’s no bowl and I’m saying, “Hey you might want to get a bowl and you might want to get it real, real quick because your popcorn is about to pop.” The popcorn starts popping and it’s endless. I’m standing there and trying to make a bowl with my arms to try to contain the popcorn. Of course it’s going everywhere. It wouldn’t normally be that big of a deal, but the floor is filthy. The countertop is also filthy. I’m looking down and thinking you can’t even save this. He’s trying to sweep all the popcorn up with a broom. There are other people around in the kitchen - one of his children saying, “nice way to go, dad,” and I think my dad is standing there like, “yeah, that’s not a good way to pop popcorn.” As he’s sweeping up the popcorn, there’s dirt and hair and gross stuff in with the popcorn and the popcorn maker is still going. There’s tons of it and it’s all over the floor. I’m like, “I don't know what you’re going to do with all of this. You’re going to have to throw it away.” He says, “Well, don’t worry, we’ll make more.” I’m like, “Well the amount you just made is huge and the popcorn machine is still going and none of this is edible.” It feels like a waste.

1042,1414,,23/07/2020,07/23/2020 00:05,"“Grapefruits in Church and Racecars in the Water” This dream starts in my house. It’s not the house I currently live in; it’s not a house I’m familiar with at all. I’m in the kitchen and my daughter is with me. We are talking as though we haven't been anywhere in a long time. We are aware that there is a church nearby and lots of people have given us good feedback on it and we know that the group that goes there is really involved in a lot of things in the community. So even though church has not been something that we’ve had favorable ideas about in the past, we decide to give it a try. It’s Sunday. We walk to the church. The church is enormous. It’s beautiful. It’s built of stone; it looks like hand-hewn rock. It rises really high up into the sky. On the front of it, there is a really large stained glass window in the shape of a rose. There are spires around the outside of it that also rise straight up. The doors are all hewn wood. The wood is so thick and the doors are bigger than normal. This is what you see from the outside. The church probably takes up a whole block. The doors are open. People are starting to file in. The faces aref friendly. There is such a multicultural, multi demographic of people of gender and age and they just reflect such a wide variety of life. My daughter and I look at each other; we smile, but we don’t say anything. We’re thinking, “Yep, this is going to be good.” We go in. There’s an older woman who is taking people’s names. She’s asking questions about our interest. She notes these on a clipboard then directs us to go upstairs. She also tells which room to go to when the service is over. She is clumping people by interest. We walk up a really wide staircase - it’s probably three staircases wide - and it creaks under my feet. The creaking is like an orchestra because there are a lot of people and as each person’s foot lands on the stairs, the stairs make a creak. So it’s a symphony of creaks. The staircase winds around. I can feel the vibration of people’s creaking steps overtop my head. It takes a while to go up the stairs and finally we get to the top. We’re in the balcony of the church. We know which pew to sit in - I guess she’s told us. So we sit and the wood is really dark - it’s like a black walnut dark. It’s hard to see who else is sitting there because we blend into the wood. As my eyes adjust to the darkness, I can see the silhouette of other people’s shoulders and heads in the pews in front of us. It’s not really crowded up here. There is a lot of space between the pews and I notice that there are leaves or something between the pews in the balcony. I can also see the leaves in the front of the balcony - where the balcony ends and there should be a big open space because there are pews down below, the leaves keep going. As I stare into them, I see lighter colors and a tree growing in between and fruit of some sort. A couple people are picking the fruit and passing them to each other. So whoever is picking them in the leaves beyond the balcony, I don’t know what they’re standing on. I realize what they’re tossing to people in the balcony is the biggest grapefruit I’ve ever seen in my entire life - they’re the size of basketballs. It seems to be organized so the people who are plucking them are tossing them to people who are collecting them. I feel that the pew underneath me is starting to move, so it’s moving sideways and then picking up speed. It goes all the way across the church and then like a rollercoaster, it goes down rapidly. I think I’m on a rollercoaster, but it’s moving through the church. I can see the track that it’s on and it ends after the first downward slope. I think there’s no track after that and we’re going to stop too abruptly and fly out of this and get hurt. But we don’t. There is no whiplash and no ramification in my body from having stopped that abruptly at all. Then everybody in that pew gets out and starts climbing back up. So my daughter and I do the same thing. It’s as though this has happened many times before. No one is surprised; no one is shocked. As soon as everyone is out, the pew slowly recedes back up the big slope and back into position. That’s where everybody is going. So we’re new and we follow the crowd. It’s a steep slope to climb up and I have to use my hands as well as my feet. I think the floor is slippery and I’ll slide backwards, but I don’t. The floor is made out of these round river rocks about the size of my palm. I can feel that the water has molded the shape of these rocks. They are of many different colors like the bottom of a stream in northern Canada. So there’s granite and pinks and greys from unaged granite like a limestone, and the pinks and blacks from millenia aged granite. So we climb back up and there’s just enough curvature in these stones that your hands and fingers and toes fit in them nicely. We walk back up. Now the pew is back in its spot, so we sit there. Now my eyes feel lighter. I look up and see that the whole top of the church is glass and open to the sky. The leaves I saw before were sitting in the top of a tree. The sermon that I thought would be delivered is not really. It’s just people sitting up there receiving the top of the tree, the sky. And now the pew I’m sitting in, I realize it’s not just made of wood, but under my feet is deep dark rich earth. There are more than just grapefruits here. There are other fruits. I can see something red and wonder if it’s mango or plum. There is also walnut. We’re up here to harvest. My daughter and I start to pluck and we know it’s okay to just pick what is ripe. The things I thought were grapefruit, I’m not sure that they are now. The unripe ones are yellow and as people pick them, they turn a deep dark ruby red. But they are the size of a basketball and the skin feels like a grapefruit skin. Now we have crates. I’ve noticed that we’re only picking a little from each thing. Then people start standing up and going back down the really wide staircase. So my daughter and I follow. We’ve picked some things, too. I can still feel the residue and can smell the things we picked - it’s on the skin of my hands and it smells so good. My feet feel the fertility of that black earth underneath as we walk. So we go back down the staircase. I feel really full, vibrant, alive, sensuous. People are dividing off into different rooms. The room we end up in is one where people are packing a lunch because we’re going down to the water to meet at the dock. My daughter and I are a little confused. We think we were supposed to have brought food but we didn’t. Then I notice a kitchen and people are going in there. I think: “Have we contributed to this in some way?” So there’s a little bit of confusion in my mind about whether or not we can help ourselves to the food to make our lunch or if we’re just supposed to help make it or if we’ve contributed to it already. Then during this confusion with people packing lunches and stuff, I see I have a thermal bag and we do have food in it. We have sandwiches and some hard boiled eggs. I zip it up and sling it over my shoulder. Again there’s this organic flow of movement that we follow with people. It leads out of the church and down to the water. During this time, my memory returns back to the woman at the door. I’m asking her if she knows where we’re supposed to be at what time. She says, “Oh yes, I still have that information, it’s just not at my fingertips. Because I haven’t seen you in a long time, I put it over here. But I thought you’d be back.” That’s just a memory. Then the people we’re with and my daughter and I are now down at the dock. We’ve walked down this path from the church - it’s a dirt path that’s wide and more like an outskirts of the city path. We aren’t in an urban area. It’s like non-urbanized, but we’re not in the woods because there’s grass and stuff. When we get to the dock there is an eclectic collection of boats; some are covered and I can’t see what they are. It’s not just a dock, it’s an organized pier with different fingers on it. There seems to be more fingers on the right and just a few on the left and a main pier going down the center. As we are walking, the crowd of people we’ve left from the church with break out into smaller groups. Then, my daughter and I are in a group with just four or five people. I see in one of the groups, a guy I know. He lives where I do and used to be a friend, but I’ve recently noted that he’s involved in this conspiracy group and they’re campaigning for people not to wear masks and the idea that the pandemic has been a hoax - a government trick to take away our rights. He’s posting things with known conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers like Andrew Wakefield and stuff. So I see him but his face is frozen in a fake smile. He goes over to another pier with a few people. They get into a motorboat with triple engines. They take the cloth off and there are fumes and they speed away. It makes a really sound like a muscleman car with a hole cut in the hood and the engine raised with tripe carbonators and it’s so deafening you can't hear anything else. The people we’re with take the cloth off the boat. I’m happy to see it’s a sailboat. Then an older man in the group says to me: “You know how to sail this, you know how to operate this boat, right?” I say, “I do, but it’s not mine. Whose boat is it?” He says, “It’s okay, we can all use it. I have permission.” I’m feeling really uncomfortable that the person who owns the boat isn’t here and this other person who I don’t know and have just met today and been divided into a group with is saying that it’s okay to use it. He reassures me, but I’m so hesitant about just taking off in this boat. I explain to him that I’m not going to do it until I know the owner, who is a woman, says it’s okay. He says, “Okay,” then leaves. My daughter and I are on the sailboat. It’s a 28 foot sailboat. The equipment for starting it is in a little different place than I’ve seen before. So I start looking around the boat and locate where everything is. I’m checking out the rigging.There’s a series of about eight flip switches in a double row - the kind that are like a little nipple but made of metal and switch on and off. They’re underneath the gunnels on the port side of the boat. I can feel them with my fingers and am thinking it’s a weird place to have this because normally they’re where you can see because you need to flip the batteries on and off every time - you have to flip on the radio then turn it off when you leave. So I can’t see what the operate. I’m trying to figure this out. The ship’s wheel is also really weird. Normally small sailboats just have a tiller. As I’m looking at it I’m thinking that this is like a combination of a motorboat and sailboat, which is really odd. Then, that makes me wonder. We get out of that boat and I’m looking around at the others. There are race cars under some of the cloths - they’re not even ships at all, but they’re bobbing up and down so they’re floating somehow. This is really weird. So now I’m off the boat of the woman who I didn’t know. The rest of the group who was supposed to sail has gone. I think that’s okay because I didn’t think we were supposed to take out a boat of someone we don’t know anyway. Then I see a boat that belongs to someone I do know but he’s not there. So I text him and ask him if he’s going to be sailing today. He says, “Yes. Just wait there and I’ll be down at my boat in a moment.” My daughter and I wait. We’re getting hungry so I open up the thermal bag and we divide up our lunch. We’re just in the process of eating when I see the owner of the boat come down the pier. He says, “Okay, are you guys ready to go?” We say yes. The door to his boat is slanted away from the pier - not unusual for a sailboat - but as he takes the teak board off the door, it’s right up against the dock and as we look in, it’s so deep that it’s black - you can’t see anything. The bow extends outwards from the dock and it’s so long I can’t see the end. It’s enormous. Unfortunately, that’s when I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

1045,1205,,24/07/2020,07/24/2020 00:01,"I can see a pair of motorcycles and a thing that has three wheels, like the comfy ride for old people who want to ride motorcycles, but can’t stay on two wheels. I’m observing all of this and don’t feel like I’m in this part of the dream. So these two women riding these motorcycles are pretty fucking badass and I’m just watching them. They’re going pretty fast. There’s a dude in this three-wheeler behind them. He’s kind of reckless and pushing him from behind. They’re weaving in and out of cars and traffic. The feeling of it is really dangerous. There aren’t a lot of cars. The road itself is going through wheat fields and forest on the other side of the road. The terrain keeps changing as everyone is speeding through this. There’s also a bus behind that’s kind of following. I’m going back and forth between hovering over the motorcycles watching and being in the bus and talking to the bus driver. I’m watching these motorcycles and at one point I see the guy in the three-wheeler veer off into a wheat field and destroy a bunch of the wheat. Then he comes back onto the road and is still behind these women. The feeling of this part is really intense - the sounds of the motorcycles are really loud in my ear. The wheels of the motorcycles and the three-wheeler are cartoonishly big. There are other passengers in the bus. The inside of the bus is like a school bus, the way the seats are set up, but the outside of the bus doesn’t look like a school bus. I don’t know who the bus driver is - it’s not somebody I recognize. He has a wise demeanor about him - he has the feeling of being a guide in this dream. I’m watching and then the scene cuts away into some sort of night club or bar. I’m leaning against a bar and talking to these two men whose eyes are a light piercing blue with a light behind them. There’s definitely flirting going on between us. There’s a mirror behind the bartender where all the alcohol is sitting on shelves. It’s dim inside. I know that the people on the motorcycles are safe and fine. I see that the guy that was pushing them on is back on the bus. The bus is now a lab and he’s standing in this metal cage with rings. The metal cage is very close to his body but not actually touching him. There’s one ring around his knees, another around his hips and another around his chest. His hands are tied behind him and his body is all bruised. His hair is red. His skin is pretty pale. He’s yelling as if there’s some sort of punishment happening to him in this bus that has turned into a lab. So one part of my attention is on that and another part of my attention is with these two guys. It almost feels like they’re trying to distract me from what’s happening to this other dude in the bus. I keep seeing electricity coming out from the contraption that he’s in and that’s what’s making him scream. Then just like a scene fades in a movie, the lights go down on the guy in the bus/lab. The lights were an eerie blue and then they fade away totally. I’m left in the bar and the lights have a red tinge even though they’re dim.",Rose,last_nights_dream

We had a large house by the lake up at the pond. Everyone was milling about talking, eating or watching TV. I was a bit tired and went into a backroom with some comfortable chairs and attempted to doze off. Jared and some others came in and sat down. They thought that I was asleep and spoke jokingly about the state of consciousness that one enters as one is drifting off to sleep. I said something humorous indicating that I wasn't asleep.  Later that afternoon, everyone was gathered and told that we would have to play volleyball. There was some debate as so whether his instruction would allow those who weren't any good at the game to do something else. I stood with the group of guys watching the game, but was bored and anxious about having to play so I decided that I would instead go out and swim to the rock in the middle of the lake. I walked barefoot up a terraced hill like the one in my parents backyard and was a bit worried by all of the bees or wasps and that I might step on one.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

Multiple levels have been flattened and carved out from the side of the cliff. The water is rushing down below. This is all red dirt, too. There are a lot of palm trees and bamboo trees. We’re climbing around. My husband tells someone we have to go and gives them our information because he can help them figure out how to purchase the land if they’re interested. I look down and a few people have dropped little homemade paper boats into the water. They’re swirling around in the edies. I see the initials D.T. on one of the boats. I think I should reach down to get the boats before they collapse and become trash. Before this scene, we’re in a house on a property with a few different dwellings.

At one point I lucidly realized I was detoxing from my heart. I could feel energy coming off the heart. I am wandering around outside in a town I don’t recognize. It’s dark. There’s a parade or some kind of street celebration happening. I’m wandering by myself following an intuitive tug to wander. I don’t know where I’m going or why I’m out. I just know that the thing I need to do or see will show up. Sure enough, I’m walking through an outdoor mall area towards one of the streets. I see my old hula teacher. I know this is why I was walking - I need to talk to her. I also see her twin sister. Her twin sister has a bunch of girls who are going to dance. My hula teacher also has her girls that will be dancing. The twin sister’s girls are wearing green skirts with white tops. My hula teacher’s girls are wearing red skirts with white tops. My hula teacher sees her niece with her twin sister’s halau. She starts yelling at her niece: “I saw you come take your costumes. Why are you dancing with her?” She’s not being nice at all. I’m observing this from the side. She’s shaming her hardcore, which is waht she used to do to me. I walk up to her and say hello. She doesn’t want to talk with me - she’s just giving me side-eye and stink-eye. She does not want to engage. I walk with her for a little bit. Her students walk ahead of us. The twin sister and those students also walk ahead, so it just ends up being me and her. I look at her and tell her that I was so upset and I’ve been upset and mad at her with the way she talks to others and treats people. I tell her I understand she thinks she’s doing it from a place of love, but it’s really hurtful to others in the way she shames them. She’s rolling her eyes at me while I’m saying this. I grab her shoulders and give her a hug and say, “I forgive you. And don’t do that anymore. Stop doing that to the people you love. Don’t do that to me or to the other people in your life.” - kind of ho’oponopono style. I think this is where I was doing the detoxing because I can feel a weight come off my shoulders because I finally said what I needed to say to her. She doesn’t soften towards me, but I get to say what I need to say. The dream shifts. I’m with people I don’t recognize. I’m traveling somewhere. This man who I recognize from infomercials on tv. He is a white dude with greyish-white hair that’s long to his shoulders, skinny guy. He asks me and some others to come with him. He’s recruiting us. He wants to show us this product and this lifestyle he’s created. He takes us to his complex - he lives there, but there are also places for others to live. There’s a cafeteria where they all go and eat meals. He has a couple assistants that help him. One of his assistants is his brother or something. I’m getting guru and cult vibes. There is a lot of advanced technology. He is trying to sell me on a way to be really healthy. So he’s walking me and the other recruits through his program or process of how to do it. The whole time I’m like, “Dude, you’re missing some major components. What you call exercise isn’t exercise. The kind of food you serve is not a healthy way to track food and it won’t work because the food you’re eating isn’t healthy. And no pill has ever gotten anyone healthy ever.” I’m mostly silent. We’re all following him around this complex. At one point he asks me to take off my shoes. So I take off my shoes and they end up in this trash chute. Now I’m like, “Shit, I don’t have shoes.” I’m going around without them and following him. I feel gross. I don’t want to be here with this dude. It feels weird. It feels controlling. It feels manipulative. At one point, we’re in the cafeteria and he’s sending us and the recruits home because he was disappointed in us and we didn’t do good enough. That’s because all of us were questioning him and his weird take on things. We’re in the cafeteria and he says, “Take some salso home with you.” I’m filling a container with salsa and it’s overflowing. One of his assistants comes to help and she says, “Here’s a lid.” I don’t want the salsa because it doesn’t seem healthy and what am I going to do with a huge bucket full of salsa, anyway. I’m still barefoot and concerned because I can’t find my shoes. They’re taking us off the complex and putting us in a vehicle to escort us off. I’m frustrated because I don’t have my slippers. Then the scene changes again. It’s somewhere in Asia - I don’t know if it’s Japan or China or somewhere else. There’s a wedding happening. They’re trying to teach me how to do the wedding ceremony. It’s complicated and involves dragons and a sleigh that flies in the air. I watch it the first time and am like, “Okay, I think you’re missing some parts to this thing because the sleigh isn’t flying right.” Then it’s my turn. A show is going on and they’ve saved this part for me to do. I manage to get the first part of the ceremony down, marrying this cute couple who are Asian - everyone is Asian and I’m the only one who is not. There are two dragons hooked to the front of the sleigh. I manage to get the sleigh up off the ground. It’s going through the air and the couple is in it. I’m in the back behind decorating it and watching the dragons. The dragons have their mouths on a bar under the sleigh and their momentum is propelling the sleigh forward. All of a sudden I hear someone say, “You forgot a piece of it.” In the ceremony the sleigh is supposed to be able to move forward but then dip and go different directions, but as I’m doing it, the sleigh comes to a dead stop midair and even though the dragons’ mouths are hanging onto the bar, their bodies flop down and the sleigh has no momentum. I’m like, “Oh god, the sleigh is going to start falling. The couple in it are going to die. I’m going to die, too, because I’m somehow connected to all of it.” I don’t know what the missing piece is to keep the sleigh going, to keep the ceremony going, to keep the whole thing moving. I’m freaking out because either I didn’t learn it or I wasn’t taught it or shown it. I know I’m missing a piece and these dragons are hanging. Then the sleigh starts to drop. The dream shifts. It’s dark now. I’m walking through a neighborhood - through the backyards of brick row houses. I’m on the phone with someone who is my counselor. The person I’m talking to is a woman. As she and I are talking, we are interrupted by a man. He’s talking over the woman. He starts to say, “No, I’m the one who’s going to take care of you. Don’t call her. I’m the one who’s talking to you. I’m taking care of you.” It’s very creepy because he’s very possessive and he’s speaking in terms of ownership. I’m thinking, “Ew, ick, you’re supposed to be a therapist.” The woman hangs up while this other man is still on the call. I keep walking through these backyards. All of a sudden I walk through a backyard and there’s a table set up. There’s a big old banyan tree behind the table. I walk up to it. The dude on the phone with me is sitting there. We both hang up and I’m looking at him and am a little bit freaked out. He’s in my space now and here face to face and trying to counsel me around something. He’s creeping me out. He has dark hair that’s curly and it’s longish, it looks like a little fro. He tells me to sit down in the chair on the other side of the desk from him. He says, “I’m taking care of you now. I’m your therapist. I’m the one you’re supposed to talk to.” I’m like, “I don’t want to talk to you. You’re creeping me out.” Then he starts to say things like, “And yes, I’m totally flirting with you because I think you’re sexy and I’m going to make you mine.” Now I’m really fucking freaked out. That’s where the dream ends.",Rose,last_nights_dream
1072,1417,,30/07/2020,07/30/2020 00:02,"“The Radio Show” I’m in a really interesting old house here. It’s semi-dark, too - it’s like the air has that kind of presence to it where the molecules have some kind of sentience. You can feel the energy in the air. It feels compassionate. So it’s also not very light. The windows, although they’re big, don’t seem to transmit an awful lot of light, so that casts a little bit of a shadowy effect over everything in the house. I’m aware that there is a floor above me, but I don't go into it in my dream. The ceilings are really high. The windows are deep and wide. It feels like mid-eighteenth century architecture of someone who would have had enough money to build a fair-sized house. I guess you would call the parlor, because it’s off the kitchen, has a big archway that goes into the sitting room. I can see the sitting room and kitchen from the parlor, but I stay in the parlor which has a big couch with deep cushions in it and a turkish rug that’s woven and quite colorful in muted tones. There’s electronic equipment against one of the walls. I’m there because I’m supposed to be recording some kind of radio show. In order to add my segment, I have to walk over to the electronic equipment - it’s got dials on it - and I’m moving the dials around watching the needle on the screen move up and down as I turn the dial. I’m trying to get it centered in the screen so I have a signal. Once I get the needle centered, I can hear the radio show that’s in progress. When I hear a certain tone, I’m supposed to start talking. I have brought with me what looks like an iPod, but it’s not. It’s some kind of device that adds music that will be a bridge. I have to fade in the music, let it play for a few seconds, then fade the music out, then I’m to say what I’m supposed to say. My segment is 30 minutes. So I do this. I am waiting for the tone and I hear the tone. Somebody else’s music enters the feed. I can hear it, but when I try to center the dials to add my section, that music won’t go away. I think, “Well, I’ll just sit here and wait the half hour that my segment is supposed to be and if the music keeps playing, then I’ll just leave after the half hour is over. I’m waiting. Twenty-three minutes pass and I know there’s only seven minutes left. I think it’s almost going to be time for me to go when someone else comes in the room. She says, “Oh, you’re not adding your part.” I say, “No, there’s this strange music that isn’t responding to any of the dials.” So she goes over and starts moving the dials around. She’s trying to fix it. Her girlfriend comes into the room and sits down on the floor and waits. She spends the next seven minutes fiddling with it. Then the time is up. I just tell them I’m going to go. They ask, “Can you come back and try again tomorrow at the same time?” I consider this for a minute wondering if i want to keep just coming back here and waiting for nothing to happen. I say, “I’ll try and come back one more time tomorrow.” Then, I’ve got this pack that goes across one shoulder, across my body and sits on my hip. I reach into it and grab two round discs about the size of a Canadian toonie. But they’re not toonies. They’re bumpy, thin and made of a condensed grain of some sort. I’m thinking that if you put them in water, they’ll swell up. I hand one of them to her. I close up the flat. As I turn around I notice one of my students is there. He walks with me as I go out the door. I walk down the porch and all of a sudden, it’s a lot lighter outside, but the sun isn’t shining; it’s like there’s less darkness. Het disappears - I guess he walks somewhere else. There’s a group of people, vendors, that have lined up these tall skinny tables that are like tubs along the sidewalk. I don’t see what’s in them - they’re a little taller than my head, so I can’t see what’s inside. They’re probably 1 foot by 2 foot in diameter and maybe another 1 foot deep. At the end of one, there’s a stepladder and I can climb up to see what’s in there. As I climb up, I see a whole bunch more of these little discs. I realize that they’re not made of grain, but of almonds. A woman who appears to be in charge approaches. She says “Aa-mond” instead of almond. I’m thinking, “Is that the proper way to say this?” She repeats it twice like a callout: “Aa-mond Aa-mond, Aa-mond Aamond.” So she’s selling them. She asks me if I’m interested in one of the Aa-monds Aa-monds. I tell her, “No thank you.” She says, “Come and sit down with me. I want to talk with you.” There’s something that looks like a two-person porch swing where the people are facing each other and your feet sit on the bottom and it moves on its own rocker. She sits in it and indicates that she wants me to sit across from her. So I do. She leans in. She has a smirk on her face as though she thinks it’s funny and says, “What do you think of Aa-mond Aa-mond?” I say, “The catchy way you’re pronouncing it? Or the product itself?” She says, No, what do you think of the way I’m calling it out?” I say, “Well, it’s catchy. Caught my eye. I don’t understand what it is, but it was catchy enough that I turned my head to listen to you.” She kind of laughs. Right at that point, the dream ends, but in front of my face, I see this dangling pendant. It’s the size of my face and is all silver. It looks like it’s made out of molded Mercury. It’s a cat - a wild cat. It’s strangely futuristic amid this old-style market. It’s sleek, like a jaguar. It’s dangling on something. So it just appears and hangs down in front of my face. It’s probably 8-10 inches long and maybe about 4 inches wide. The mouth is slightly open and the lips are sort of curled back and it has fangs. It really looks like a jaguar head, except its ears are flattened, so there’s a sleakness about it that really doesn’t belong in the historical feel of the house, street market or the Aa-mond Aamond that people are selling.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

1075,1209,,31/07/2020,07/31/2020 00:02,"I’m on the campus of the school I went to for middle school, which was an old inn that was converted into a school. The buildings are all layered shingles and it was really a beautiful campus. I have in the back of my head a nagging, “Hey, you have a car that you have to pick up. You have an appointment with your car.” But I don’t put it in my phone calendar for whatever reason. I’m there on the campus and taking classes. I’m like, “That’s fine, I’ll just remember or I’ll just know when it’s time to go.” So I’m in classes and car alarms are going off and they’re kind of irritating. One of my friends from high school is there. She’s like, “God, can you hear those car alarms? They’re so annoying.” I’m wondering if one of the car alarms is my car that I need to go take in and I just haven’t. Then, she says, “I also need to go. Can you drive me?” I grab my keys. The campus has completely shifted. Now everything is concrete - the walls, the stairs, the floor, everything. We’re walking out of the classroom and down some stairs and into the parking lot. I can’t find my car anywhere. So we just get into a car. I think someone else is driving and they start driving us around. This part is blurry; all I can remember is the impression of being driven around in a car. At one point I’m like, “I need to get out because I need to get my car.” I leave my friend and whoever is driving us. My hands are full of things. One of the things I have is a parachute-type thing and it’s small enough to fit in my hand. It’s really, really windy out. I’m still on this mission to go find my car. Now I’m walking down the side of the road - it’s the piece of the road that was right before the turn to my neighborhood when I was growing up. So this is all happening in Hawaii. I’m talking to my dad. I don’t know if it’s on the phone or in person. I’m like, “Hey dad, I’m trying to find the car. It needs to be fixed. But watch this. I’m going to be able to get to it real quick.” I start running in the direction of the wind and the wind grabs that parachute thing in my hand and I start flying. I am flying down the road with it and he’s totally impressed that I’m doing it. The cars that are driving by me are impressed and they’re totally honking. I’m flying down the road. I fly way further than I could have walked. I get halfway down the road that takes us from our house down to the beaches. There’s a pullout on one side of the road. On the other side of the road is a pullout but also a cave. So I cross the road and go into this cave because I’m thinking my car will be there. There’s all this half-done prep for a meal and it’s been left. So I go into this cave and see all these countertops with everything you would need in a kitchen - utensils, a stove, a vitamix, a mixer, all kinds of kitchen tools I don’t even recognize, a sink full of dishes. It looks like it has been left for weeks and weeks and weeks. No one has cleaned it. They were in the middle of a meal when they left, so there are things rotting and it’s gross. This whole time I have this feeling that I’ve gotta find the car and I need to get it fixed. But then when I walk into this kitchen, I’m like, “Oh shit, I gotta clean all this up, too. I gotta take all this stuff out to the compost.” I have this nagging feeling the whole time. Somebody joins me, a younger man. He’s like, “Yeah, I gotta work on all this, too.” I’m like, “Well, do you want to help me clean this up?” He starts cleaning up. Then my dad shows up at this cave. He says, “Well, if you want to get in my car, I’ll help you find your car.” I’m like, “Well, what about cleaning up this cave?” He’s like, “Yeah, you can do that later or whatever.” The dream ends here and I don’t know if I get in my dad’s car or what.",Rose,last_nights_dream

William thought that it might be natural but I was pretty sure it couldn't be. I heard a scurrying behind me and immediately realized that the downed trees and branches were from a beaver making a dam. Looking behind me, I saw a very small weasel sized beaver running up to us. Afraid that it would bite me, we moved to the side to let it pass.   It's lake was directly to our left and we decided to help it. We grabbed one of the logs on the side of the path and, with the beaver's help, rolled it down into the water. William then began gnawing with the beaver at a tree that was partially chewed through. I began swimming around the lake looking for fish and other useful thi ngs. William joined me in the water, and somehow I discovered that the beaver was an undead entity and that there were two others in the lake as well. We discussed the issue as all undead were evil yet the beaver was friendly. I wanted to save the beaver from his undead state but no magic allowed this.

1087,1210,,01/08/2020,08/01/2020 00:08,"I’m in a neighborhood with fancy houses on a hill. I’m outside walking along the road. It’s on a hill, so things are terraced. There are three animals - not any animals I’ve seen in this world. They have the body of a giraffe, but are striped like zebras and have a little tuft of fur on top of their heads that’s bright green or bright pink. They kind of remind me of horses, but kind of not. They’re in front of me and I’m walking down a hill. They start running and I start running. I notice it’s really easy to run because it’s downhill. Even though they’re running at a pace that an animal with four legs can run, which is way faster than us usually, I’m keeping up just fine. As they’re running, I’m behind them and then I think I’m herding them, but then at one point, they’re actually herding me. They stop running at one house. They start to mill in front of it. They herd me away from the house. As I run past the house, I see a gigantic alligator in the front yard and they’re putting their bodies between me and it, so they’re protecting me from it. These animals are different sizes, so it’s clearly male, female and baby. I’m so shocked and concerned because they have the baby kind of close to the alligator and I don’t want it to get eaten. Then I keep running a bit and they slowly disappear out of the dream. All of this has been downhill - at no point did it flatten out - so I’ve been running downhill this whole time. Then I get to the top of the stairs. All around the stairs is the body of a snake and I can’t find its tail and I can’t find its head. It’s huge, huge, like I couldn’t reach my arms around the body of it. And it’s long. I’m at the top of these stairs and these stairs are eight flights high and I’m walking down. I’m a little bit nervous because of the body of the snake and I don’t know where its head or tail is. Its shed snakeskin is right next to it. It’s wrapped around the railing of these stairs that are all concrete. I was just rubbing through suburbia with manicured lawns and lovely front yards and huge houses, then I just get to this deadend with these concrete stairs. The snake body is wrapped along the entire handle down the eight flights are so. I get to the bottom and there’s the head of the snake. And it’s dead. It looks like he had died mid-molt because part of its skin is still coming off its head. There is still so much snake body around - it’s twisted and knotted and all over the place. I get close to make sure it is actually dead and it is definitely dead. At the bottom of the stairs, something is waiting for me, but I’ve lost what it was because I was so concerned with making sure the snake was not alive because it was big enough to eat me and swallow me whole. I had this thought while I was descending: “Oh, you’re descending stairs and here’s a snake and all that represents, and it’s shedding and it’s dead and here we are at the bottom.” So part of me was lucid here observing the imagery and taking note of the different archetypes at play here. The dream did continue on, but I don’t remember it. Oh, there were a bunch of green plants at the bottom of the stairs and a hag writing feverishly. She was writing on parchment with a black charcoal like pen. I can hear the scratching of her pen on paper and the rustling of the green plants in the wind. I don’t remember what she was writing or what she told me, though.",Rose,last_nights_dream
1088,1418,,01/08/2020,08/01/2020 00:09,"“The Mural” It’s strange that I’m in the bedroom I had when I was a kid, but the furniture is gone. There are several people here with me, including my daughter and somebody I used to work with - I can’t remember which restaurant and I’m not even sure of his name. I think there is the man who did my daughter’s tattoo. I feel like my stepmother is in there, as well. The point of everybody being there is to draw a mural. It’s not clear what the subject of the mural is supposed to look like. One person starts off drawing in black with paint and a paintbrush what looks to be a fish. But then somebody comments, “No that’s not right. That’s not what it looks like,” and then adjusts it - makes the torso/belly area a little thinner and makes it even thinner as it goes back towards the tail. Then someone else says, “Mmm, that’s closer, but it still doesn’t look right.” Then someone else takes the paintbrush and begins to draw legs on it. Now it’s starting to look more like an insect with somewhat of a fish face. There’s a consensus that yes, that’s much closer to what it resembled. Then my daughter gets in there and removes part of it and adds what I think is much more accurate in terms of the legs and ribcage. Then I fall asleep for a little while, maybe just five minutes. I don’t think anyone noticed I was sleeping. When I woke up, it’s stunning. I’m thinking that it’s exactly what it looks like and it’s even got more details. I see the tattoo artist with the paintbrush in his hand and think yes, he would have been the one to put the detail on it. Then the other guy leaves the room and I do, too. We go down the hall and into the kitchen. He stays in the kitchen and I go out front of the kitchen. Now it looks like the kitchen has a passthrough window and the seating area is a big wide square auditorium. There are long rectangular tables set up that hold food, like a wedding buffet. The tables are covered with a white cloth. There are also round tables covered with white cloths and they have multiple chairs at them. There’s a stage like a school auditorium, but there’s no one on it and people aren’t facing the stage, either. The food is all set out on this one L-shaped table. I look at it and think that the food looks disgusting. It looks sloppy. Every single one has dried ramen noodles on the top as some kind of garnish. The items in the bowls are covered with breading. Each one looks slightly the same, only a little different. There are also cheese balls rolled in cracker crumbs and deep fried. I just think, “Ugh, there’s nothing fresh anywhere.” My son is sitting at the table and I know he needs to eat. So I take two plates - one for him and one for me - and I head for the platter of plain roasted chicken with mashed potatoes. I think we can eat that. Just as I get there, a man who looks like the man who bought my sailboat. In my dream he has three little kids. He takes the big serving fork and squishes all the chicken up with the mashed potatoes and gravy and it’s making some kind of thick soup. I’m aghast because there were dried wheat noodles on the top and now they’re all mixed in. I say to him, “You can’t do that on a buffet! Now nobody else can eat that.” He’s saying, “Well, my kids like it that way.” I tell him that now there’s nothing for us to eat. I’m angry. I can feel the anger in my body - I can feel my heart racing and my body tightening up. So I try to sift through it with my spoon to determine if there are any pieces of potato or chicken that the gravy and wheat didn’t stick to. But after putting two tiny spoonfuls on my plate, I know it’s hopeless and I just set the plates down. My son goes back to the table and he’s just sitting there. I approach the kitchen and am thinking, “I wonder if that Rob guy has anything back there that he could give us that is not quite ready to be served on the table and hasn’t been coated with all that yucky stuff yet.” I’m standing there and notice that at the base of the passthrough window has holes with stagnant water in them. The water is black with algae. I can smell the mildew earth smell rising up from it. I wonder if the water was removed from it, if it would dry up and be more healthy. There’s a plastic pump with a long hose and a hand pump at the other end. It’s like the pump you’d use to pump out the bilge in a sailboat. So I stick the end in the water and I start pumping. The water does go out of the hole, but as soon as it goes out, it fills up again. I repeat this process about three times. It keeps filling up, but it only fills up a little bit, just enough to cover the black earth that is the component part of the hole. So I set the pump down and I stop. I’m hesitant to ask for food from the kitchen. I go back to the table and tell my son, “Let’s just go.” We walk down a different hallway than we entered the room from. There are multiple bedrooms like there would be in a hotel for people to sleep in.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I comply the first time because it does not seem too harmful for my body, but I try not to breathe it in deeply. But the next time around, she takes out a long thin needle connected to a vat of the vaccine. When it’s my turn, I say no. I am firm but non-violent in my resistance. She has been prepared for this scenario. So instead of poking me with the needle, she pushes a stronger dose of the nasal mist up into my nostrils. I can’t breathe through my right nostril at first, but she continues to be steady and persistent in her administration of the proper dose. I do eventually take it in. i am allowed to go home.

1092,1060,,02/08/2020,08/02/2020 00:03,"I had this really interesting dream. It’s hard to describe. I had to draw it. There was an orb looking thing that almost looked like an image of the coronavirus - red with spiky things. It was the Mother and there was a baby - a little piece that was connected to it and was the baby. Somehow it got disconnected from its mother and someone threw it into a pool. I was like, “Oh my god, it needs to be with its mother!” So I dove into the pool. I was swimming all over and all around and the pool was fifty or a hundred feet. I was going to the very bottom. I was seeing all kinds of other things. I saw my Bun-bun which is my bunny that was given to me when I was born and I still have it. I was like, “Oh, there’s Bun-bun!” Clearly it was a deep dream of my psyche and what’s down at the bottom and memories of childhood. But I kept looking for the baby piece that needed to be with the mommy piece. At a certain point I was looking underneath chairs and I was having other people help me. I was really worried about this baby that needed to be with its mother, but it wasn’t a real baby.",Mary,last_nights_dream
1093,1211,,02/08/2020,08/02/2020 00:04,"I’m driving a car. My mom is in the passenger’s seat. We’re road tripping and there are spots we have planned. At one point, I’m not paying attention and totally cross the center line and almost nail an oncoming car. My mom was freaking out in the passenger seat, as she should. I get back in my lane and we make our first stop at this house of a friend of mine and my ex’s relatives. This house is kind of cool. It’s a bunch of millennials and their focus is on social justice. They all share the house. They do lots of things together. Everything is focused on quality conversation and connection and conflict resolution, which when you live with a bunch of roommates is probably a good idea! They really go out of their way to connect. They play games to connect. They welcome us into the house and show us our bedrooms and everything. They invite us to play one of their games. I kind of lose track of my mom at this point. I think she’s there, but I’m not totally sure; she just kind of fades into the background. The young woman who is the person I know has dark curly hair down to her shoulders, Latina, shares a room with another woman who is her girlfriend. There are two or three men that all share a room. One man is gay. There’s only one white man in the entire house. It’s so interesting. I’m noticing all of this. They’re starting to play a game and the game is hard to explain - they are explaining to me a set of rules. There’s an activity for us to do and we all do the activity in our own way. At one point this activity takes us all out of the house. I find myself in a mall then back in the front yard of the house. At one point, there is a little bit of conflict, but I watch as they really calmly and with a lot of emotional intelligence explain their side and listen without judgement. Everyone is speaking with the “I feel” and “I experience” and “When this happened, it made me feel like this” language. Everyone is really supportive of each other and cheering each other on as we each take turns in playing our part in this game. It’s super civil. Part of me is observing this whole thing and like, “Oh okay, this is how it works. This is how people do conflict. This is how people live together. This is how people play together to enforce the bonds. This is how people love on each other.” I start to get this nagging feeling that it’s time for us to continue on our road trip. I’ve gotta go. This was supposed to be a stop and I learned everything I needed to learn and now it’s time to move on to the next thing. I’m cleaning up my space. It’s like an Airbnb, so I’m taking the sheets off the bed and putting the towels and sheets on the washer. My mom is here in the background and I think she’s doing her part and will then meet me out by the car. I’m saying goodbye to the woman I know. I’m kind of dragging my feet. I have to change my clothes and I’m in the bathroom and I really want to shower but it’s time to go. I kind of half shower, half don’t, and I change my clothes. I’m kind of damp. I don’t really have a towel and part of my clothes get wet. I head out and say goodbye to everyone. I’m going through all these doors and they are the wrong doors to the outside. Well, they aren’t exactly the wrong doors. There was a direct route for me to get out to the car or there was this route through the living room and out through the kitchen into the sunroom, then garage, and then outside. It takes me a couple tries to get out of the house, but eventually I get out and we say goodbye. I get in the car and we continue on. It was light and bright in this dream - broad daytime - unlike other dreams this past week.",Rose,last_nights_dream

When I went back to sleep it was like there was a third part or parent or spirit or another presence that was trying to soothe me. It wasn’t like I was trying to talk myself down which is what usually happens. It was like I wasn’t doing it. The soothing was saying, “You don’t need to feel like this; this won’t happen; it’s going to be okay now,” - the kind of parenting stuff you’d say to a kid.

I gave them some food and they were wolfing it down because they were so hungry. When I went to the poop box to check the poop, it was disgusting and there was stuff clumped everywhere. I was scooping it all out, but there was so much in it that I let it go. The amount I was seeing didn’t make sense because it felt like how much a cat would do in a week, not a day and a half.

The three of us are doing an interpretation of a dance that has been taught to us. There’s something to do with jumping over a plastic spice lid and when you jump you need to land with the right amount of strength so just the right amount of ginger pops up out of the lid to dust the floor just enough. I am dancing with a lot of energy and flare. It feels so good. At the end, the judge leaps onto the stage and lifts my hand up and bows with me saying that i have done it just perfectly. The crowd is cheering. There are also people who have noted my perfection of sorts and I don’t feel particularly safe by their attention. There is another scene where I am in a department store. On one level are clothes designed to fit me and there is a prenatal section. On the floor above are clothes designed for heavier set women and they also have a prenatal section. I’m on the upper floor, then descend to the floor with clothes that fit me. I go to the prenatal section because I remember seeing pants that I really like. I see Liz and some other women in that female entrepreneur coaching world. They are sitting on a couch watching a show or learning something. Liz sees me and stands but doesn’t acknowledge me in a friendly way. She just stands so that I know that she knows I’m there. There’s a section with folded pants - the style I like. I know what used to fit me when I was pregnant and I recall how they were stretchy. Other people are coming to get these pants, too - I guess they just learned about them on the show. Liz picks up a pair, too. They are all hand painted and very colorful.

1100,1420,,04/08/2020,08/04/2020 00:02,"“The New Baby” I’m walking through a very busy urban area with a friend. It’s a downtown, heavily trafficked, very densely populated city. I know this because of the number of people around, the lack of space on the sidewalk, the streetcars and regular cars on the street that are passing by on the roadway, and the height of the buildings surrounding the street. I’m involved in a conversation with my friend. We’ve been walking for some blocks. We approach someone else riding a different looking kind of bicycle. It has two wheels at the back and one wheel at the front, so it’s a tricycle but it’s made for adults and you sit really low on the seat. My friend sees the person riding the bicycle and greets them. The cyclist slows down. My friend approaches the bicyclist and I realize they know each other. They have a conversation that I can’t hear. My friend’s back is to me and I can’t see who the cyclist is. It carries the energy of privacy anyway, so I don’t even try to approach. My friend walks back towards me and the cyclist continues for a few minutes ahead of us, and then she slows down again. Again, my friend approaches the cyclist and they have a private conversation. My friend comes back to me and says, “My friend doesn’t talk to that many people. So don’t take it personally. It’s just how she is.” I say, “That’s fine.” We are walking while she says this. Then the cyclist slows down enough that she’s kind of keeping pace with us. She’s cycling beside my friend who is in the middle between us. My friend hangs back a little bit. It’s just the cyclist and I. Then I see her face. I realize the cyclist is female. She’s very withdrawn - i can sense this - so I don’t try to talk with her. My friend rejoins us - the one who was walking on foot - and says, “My friend would like to talk to you.” I say, “Oh okay.” I don’t recall that she ever said anything to me. I just feel that I’ve been invited into her inner circle. We all arrive at a place where the bicycle is parked. It looks like a storefront, but I can't see what’s inside because the windows are blackened. We all walk in. There is a very large bed that takes up most of the room once we get in there. There is a little girl playing on it. Beside that, in the two foot space between the bed and wall, there is another child playing. They seem to be very close in age. I’m gauging them to be no more than one year apart and I’m thinking about this. Then I realize that my friend’s friend, the cyclist, is pregnant. The little girl that was on the bed approaches me and she’s bouncing up and down on the bed and she’s so full of joy, innocence and exuberance. She invites me to jump on the bed with her. I don’t actually do that, but I take her by the hands and my upper body is jumping up and down - I’m not on the bed, my feet are on the ground. The child that was playing on the floor tries to join us but she can't get up on the bed, so I pick her up. I’ve been interacting with the children for a few minutes when the cyclist makes some kind of comment, but I never hear her voice. I feel like she’s commented about the fact that I’m getting along with the children. Then, everyone starts playing a game - it’s a find the things that are these colors kind of game. There’s a find something that’s green game and the kids scamper off. They don’t go very far because the room is very small and crowded with all kinds of stuff and a lot of different hair ornaments. I realize that the one child that was playing on the floor has a side ponytail made of short hair that sticks out of the side of her head like a shaving brush and the other one on the bed has a complex series of colored barrettes in her hair that keeps it off her face. So there’s a lot of different hair accessories. Then it’s a find something that’s purple game. I wait til the kids find their purple things, then I take a thick scrunchie with a purple ponytail attached to it and I select that and something else with tiny purple flowers on it. Then the cyclist woman says something but not out loud. I just realize that as I’m holding this scrunchie with a purple ponytail attached to it that it’s hers and she has some other different dyed hair colors in her own hair - she’s dyed it various colors and it’s quite creative. At this point I realize that this cyclist who is pregnant and my friend are partners. They have kept this on the downlow and not told anyone. This is their family. They’re looking for someone who will help out after the next baby is born. My friend asks if I would like to do this. I say, “Yes, I would love to.” This is their way of slowly introducing me into their family without actually telling me that they were looking for someone. At this point, the doorbell rings or someone is knocking on the door. Now there is a hallway in the house and I go down the hallway to answer the door. There are some people outside with furniture. They have to bring it into the house, but it’s too big and doesn’t fit. I walk outside and look at it and see if there is any way of taking it apart. There is, but it’s really complicated. You have to take pieces of the base off. Now they look like tiles and I’m knocking them out with a hammer. There’s a man who is helping. I say to him, “Well this is good. But how do we get the tiles back in once we move it in the house?” He says, “Oh here look.” I see that there’s a tiny plastic line that encircles the whole base of this structure. If you hang the tile from it, wait a couple seconds, then give it a tap with a hammer, it replaces it. I try a few on my own with him there and it works, so this is good. The people that brought the furniture are now bringing it into the house, disassembled. I’m starting to pick up the pieces of tile and carry them back into the kitchen. The little girls are still jumping up and down and skipping around. They’re just happy. I go into the kitchen to start to prepare a meal. A man comes up behind me and goes underneath my skirt and stands up so I’m on his shoulders. I feel very light. I’m still preparing the food with my hands. It’s an interesting experience of being taller and lighter. I feel childlike. I’m enjoying this.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream
1101,1770,,04/08/2020,08/04/2020 00:03,"I was at a special doctor's appointment. The doctor saw me and then gave me a piece of paper with a fake name which I was to use for the rest of the process. My fake name still began with S., but my last name was changed. I had to approach a receptionist's window where I handed a woman my paper and she directed me to proceed.   As I wandered through the hospital, I began to suspect that it was really a concentration camp. I was placed in a place with other children none of whom were much older than 18 or 19. I was younger as well and vaguely recollect being about 15 or 16.   Everyone had to work and was paid wither $8 a day or $8 a week. There were adult guards dressed in light greenish tan uniforms. At this point I was convinced that this was a concentration camp.   In the concentration camp, everyone worked hard to get promoted so that they would be transferred to a camp where they were instead paid $800 a day or week. I was skeptical and at this point in the dream I had become a detective whose job it was to figure out what was going on. At lunch, we all lined up to eat, and I made an announcement telling everyone that this was a concentration camp and that the promotion camp was actually the place where they took people to gas them. Everyone laughed as they had already figured this much out.  My brother William was with me now and the guards came to take us as we were now seen as trouble makers. They loaded us into a helicopter and flying low to the ground left the camp. There was an adult with us in the chopper who began to plot our escape. He managed to knock out or kill one of the guards and opened the door of the helicopter. Right when we were flying low over a field of mud, he jumped as did my brother. I hesitated and jumped, almost missing the field. They had run ahead of me into the woods and I lagged behind not able to keep up.   When I finally caught up, my brother was all setup in a bivy sack with his sleeping bag. I don't remember if the man was there or not. I didn't have a sleeping bag, but I was wearing an overly long and thick trench coat which I was able to wrap myself in and sleep comfortably.  The next day we woke up to find that we were in a little valley surrounded by houses to our left and roads on the other sides. It was definitely in Appalachia. We realized that they would have people on the look out for us everywhere and that not knowing where we were (we didn't even know the country or language) we had to make friends with the locals.   We approached one of the dilapidated wooden houses and a man in a completely beat up car drove up to his garage. The man was an alien. Well, he wasn't really an alien but that is what we recognized him as in the dream. He was covered in reddish sores and looked a bit like Jeremiah from work. He had to work on his car as there was an issue with either the radiator or the hoses connecting to it. We watched as he explained what he was doing. Together we verified that the hoses were fine and that the issue lay in the radiator itself. Once the issue was fixed, he sort of agreed non-verbally to let us work for him and in exchange use the car. We were glad but also realized that the car was such a jalopy that it would draw attention for not being street-worthy and as we had no ID it could be dangerous.  We went to the opposite of the valley where a road was and stopped by a bus stop. I realized that I was now the younger brother and that we were in an Anime. The meaningful thing to do now would be to figure our a way for us to be able to attend school together.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

1104,898,,05/08/2020,08/05/2020 00:02,"I’m with my son at a building that looks like the one where my current office is. It’s wooden and there are two stories. There are different rooms that open into each other and host different childcare programs. My son isn’t enrolled in any of the programs but I need to visit with someone, so he just hangs around and people sort of welcome him in and watch him while I have my business meeting. We go home and return the next day. This time we are meeting with Kathy and her son, Bodhi. It’s so strange because when I try to introduce the boys, I can’t recall Kathy’s son’s name. I call him by a totally different name, but I can’t recall it. Then I remember his name. It’s Bodhi, but I say body? I’m trying the sound out in my mouth. Kathy steps in and pronounces it correctly. We sort of laugh about it and say this is a distracted overwhelmed mom thing where the mind totally blanks. They go on a walk and are all of a sudden gone, but we were supposed to have a playdate. I get on a phone call. Then my son is gone, too. I get nervous. I’m looking for him and calling for him. I find him in a multiracial daycare. It was multircial the day before, but now it’s only black educators and black children sitting in two circles. My son is with them, but not very welcome. I take him by the hand and we go out and down some stairs like a treehouse. Somehow I lose him again and this time it feels like he’s really far gone. I run up the street looking for him frantically. I see Kathy and Bodhi walking and they seem fine - they were just giving me space to take my phone call. It’s getting late now. I still can’t find my son. I go into the other side of the building. One room is a Waldorf school and the other is another alternative early childhood education space. I’ve been talking with them about their philosophies. I sigh in relief when I see my son there. The Waldorf teacher walks in and she shames me for not remembering that we met earlier in the dream. The other teachers are millennials. One woman has pale skin with purple hair and piercings. She’s very well spoken and I think it would be great to expose my son to her perspective. Now it’s evening. The teachers invite us to join them for dinner. They are talking about a local Japanese chef who just started at a new restaurant. They’ve ordered takeout. I feel as if I should know this chef and restaurant. My husband comes. We all go out together across a little ditch to play on a little cement structure. Now we are walking home and someone else is walking with us. I don’t feel safe.

1105,1212,,05/08/2020,08/05/2020 00:03,"I’m in a house, it’s not my house and I don’t recognize it. It’s owned by a single person - a shorter man who might be a leprechaun or an elf, very eccentric. I’m staying in this house with him, but I’m not sure why. He has other people in the house with him and it’s like he collects orphans and I’m one of the orphans he’s collected. I’m in one of the bedrooms sleeping, zonked out, kind of, but I can see people coming in and out of the bedroom to see me. There’s a cleaning lady that comes in at some point and cleans around me while I’m passed out in the bed. The little man is entertaining other people. It’s very interesting. I don’t know what happens. At some point, the man brings his friend over who is the same height as him. She’s a woman and has a bob cut, her hair is red and short. This little man has grey, shoulder length hair. They act out this skit together, kind of like a TikTok. They act out this skit that I watch. I’m observing all this and the way he treats people who are coming in and out of his house is a little strange and removed. Then the scene changes. I’m with my friend Josh. I'm seeing these gigantic redwood trees. There’s a road next to me on my left and the shoulder is so wide that it looks like a park. There are picnic tables and at one table, people are throwing a birthday party - I’m guessing, but not sure. They’re having a meal together. It’s warm out and reminds me of Hawaii, even though the trees are redwood, they sway like palm trees. I’m hearing the sound of the ocean. It’s a gathering of people coming together to celebrate. It feels nice and pleasant and celebratory. There’s affection with all the people. Cars are whizzing by because it’s still a road. A couple of feet down there is another picnic table and another group of people celebrating, so it’s like there are all these pods of celebrations happening. Then the dream switches. I’m showing Josh how to get to this one valley where there are waterfalls and pools of water. I’ve actually dreamt of this valley and these waterfalls and how to get to them years and years ago. In that dream I was with my ex-boyfriend and our friends from growing up in Hawaii. This was the place these other friends took me in my dream years ago. We are at Hapuna Beach - a beach I went to all the time. I’m taking Josh down to the end because you have to go to the very end. There are two ways to get to this place - either from the end of Hapuna Beach where you’re at the bottom of the valley and the bottom of the waterfalls and the bottom of all the pools and you have to climb up. It’s funny because the beach is sand and palm trees and the valley is lush lush lush green, so much water, and total rain forest; the river water and the water of the pools are cold from rain water. We get to the bottom and there are slippery rocks. I look up towards the waterfalls and pools and am like, “No, we can’t get to it from here. We’re going to have to go around.” We leave the bottom. I take Josh onto this narrow road - it doesn’t even have a line through the middle and it’s old with so many potholes and broken up like the roads in Hawaii from all the rain. It goes through this residential area with chickens, houses, ti leaf hedges, cute chain link fences, and laundry hanging out in the yards. The road switchbacks, so we’re walking up the road back and forth and I’m trying to find the entrance - the place my friends had shown me in the other dream. I really want Josh to see the pools and be in the water because there’s something about the waters in this valley that is so healing and cleansing and I want to get to them. We’re switchbacking up this road that reminds me a little of Waipio Valley. We never get to the falls. Josh actually disappears out of the dream and my ex shows up with his lawyer. I have a lawyer. The setting is still these streets, but now we’re heading towards this house. The first thing that happens is my lawyer is convincing me that we’re fine and we have everything we need and we’re going to win the trial. My ex’s lawyer is like, “No you’re not, not even close.” So my lawyer tries to talk to his lawyer and has this little belt on that is recording. My ex’s lawyer finds it and is like, “You can’t win with this. That’s cheating. You can’t record conversations with me. That’s illegal.” So, my lawyer is essentially disgraced. My ex’s boyfriend kicks him off the case. Then this other woman comes in who is supposed to be the replacement, but she’s funny and acting clownish. She’s talking really fast. Her and my lawyer and me and my ex all get into a van. She has one of those Volkswagen vans. She’s driving around and says, “We’ve gotta find someone who’s willing to take on your case.” It’s so weird because my ex and his lawyer are in the car with me and we’re all talking about the case together. But she’s like, “We need to find somebody who can beat them.” And my ex’s lawyer is like, “Yup, you need to find someone who can beat me.” I’m like, “What?!” So she drives us around a little bit and she stops at this one house. First she paints her face to make it look like she’s been beat up and puts a big hat on and says, “Okay, I’m going to go into this house and we’re going to try to convince this person to be your lawyer.” She goes and knocks on the door and there’s nobody there. So she put on all this makeup to make her look like she has black eyes for no reason I can tell. She gets back in the van and we go further down this twisting road. She’s like, “Okay, we’re going to stop at this guy’s house. He knows what’s going on.” But she’s not paying attention and she drives into a pond in his front yard. I’m like, “Oh my god!” There are snapping turtles in the pond and komodo dragons in the pond and these little fish that look like horses.” I’m tripping out because all the different animals in this pond are intense because the dragons will eat you, and the turtles will snap at you, and the fish are clearly very rare. She just drove into the pond. I’m like, “Wait, this is not a very good first impression.” She reverses out of the pond and the water starts to drain. She’s like, “Well, we need to talk with this guy.” We all get out. My ex’s lawyer who is an older looking man with grey hair and really tan skin, kind of round in the body, gets out and goes to talk to the guy in the house. He’s saying, “This guy in the house is a genius. If anyone can beat me, it’s him. He needs to be the one to represent you.” I’m like, “Okay, sounds good.” He goes in the house and somehow convinces the guy. The first thing the guy notices is that his pond has drained and he’s really upset. I’m like, “Oh no, this woman who drove the van into the pond screwed it up.” But he agrees to talk with the lawyer. I can see this guy’s kids in the window and am like, “Hey kids! I know you can do this. If you come over here and turn on this one faucet and you press this one switch, the water will come back into the pond.” At this point, the pond is nothing but mud and everything is dying. It’s like we have seconds before everything is just dead. But I convince one of his kids to come out and I show them how to turn on the water and flip the controls.

1113,1213,,07/08/2020,08/07/2020 00:02,"I’m in a shop, a mix between an antique shop and a boutique. The owner is an older man who has just died. I’m in the shop working and keeping things clean. There’s another person who I think I’m working for, but I don’t know the relationship between this person and the older man who has just died. Maybe she’s his daughter? There are a bunch of people in the shop. I’m totally appalled. The shop sells all kinds of things. It’s kind of dim and there isn’t very good lighting. It’s strange that customers are here because I know that I’ve closed the shop and the owner has died. But this other person has let these people in and they’re shopping. It’s really packed. One of the customers comes up to me and is like, “I saw this dress on this mannequin and I want to buy it. Is it still for sale?” I’m like, “No. Nothing’s for sale. We’re not selling anything. The owner has just died.” This customer is really insistent. I’m really shocked at the level of disrespect they have for the death of the owner. They just don’t care; their focus is on getting what they want. Then the woman I’m working for is like, “Yep, just sell it to them.” I’m kind of shocked at her disrespect for this man who has just died and was elderly. Throughout this whole part of the dream I’m confused at people’s behavior. They just want what they want and they want to buy it and they don’t care that anyone has just died. It’s all about the things. I find myself walking through this store. There is a small bowl that fits in my hands. It has scalloped edges and it looks like a flower has been painted on the inside in gold. The bowl is a turquoise/periwinkle blue. There are two sets of chopsticks made of enamel, but look like ivory. There’s one other antique item. I have collected these items from the shop and put them in a basket and put them aside to purchase at a later date. I was going to wait until the old man had his funeral, but with everybody buying everything, I want to put it on the side. It was like this stuff was laid aside for me anyway, so I knew to grab it. As I’m gathering these items, I can feel how precious they are - it’s like they contain some sort of magic and a message. It’s really important that I have these items - they are gifts from the old man and also gifts from ancestors and spirits. I can tell they are meaningful at multiple levels. So I put them in this basket and then put the basket aside to purchase later. I notice the bowl is chipped and I go back to see if there is one that isn’t chipped. They’ve all been sold or taken. I don’t even know if people are even paying for stuff at this point. It feels like they are looting the store or something. So I stay with the one that is chipped and put it aside. Then the scene changes. I’m outside at a gathering with a bunch of people I know and a bunch of people I used to work with at the grocery store. I’m sitting on a bench with my beloved. We are hanging out. This coworker who I haven’t seen in awhile, but who I really adore shows up. I’m so happy to see her and she’s so happy to see me. Big hugs all around. She’s talking about how she doesn’t give a fuck anymore. She pulls up her dress and isn’t wearing underwear and essentially flashes me and my beloved. I start cracking up because we are both moms and we know how it feels to not give fucks anymore about what society and culture say who and what we should be. Then the two of them disappear and I’m like, “Oh, well they’re fucking.” Sure enough I suddenly hear a bed squeaking above my head upstairs. It’s funny because we were outside and now we’re in a house. I’m laughing because it’s such a funny sound because you know exactly what’s happening.",Rose,last_nights_dream
1114,1423,,07/08/2020,08/07/2020 00:03,"“Dancing” I’m in a really crowded house. Both my friend Randy and Omar are there. There are two rooms in the house. There are a lot of people in one room. They’re either standing up talking or leaning against the walls talking or sitting on chairs or furniture or on the floor. It’s extremely crowded. The other room is a kitchen. No one is in there. It’s a small room. There’s another room off of the kitchen that has a closed door to it. I can’t really see what’s in there. I get the sense that people are in it. The kitchen has a doorway at one end that feeds into the living room. There’s a wall in between so you can’t see who’s in the room from the kitchen. When the dream starts, I’m in the crowded room. I feel like I can’t move my body. I’m feeling a little bit claustrophobic. Although there are a lot of conversations going on, I’m not part of any of them. I’m starting to feel a little alienated or lonely. I leave the room and go out into the kitchen and am just standing there. My friend Randy joins me. His hair has gotten a lot longer, it’s touching his shoulders, it’s really curly and sticking out all over the place. His body is bigger. Everything is rounder. He picks me up, throws me over his shoulder and he has arms on the front of his body and arms on the back of his body. So he has four arms. He’s tall. He starts moving his body quickly from side to side, from one leg to the other leg and back. It creates this feeling like being rocked. I can feel the swiftness of the movement. It starts to feel really relaxing and I can start to feel the tension from being in the crowded room and feeling alienated leaving my body. I start to relax. I let my head relax and my upper body, my shoulders, my arms and my hands. I close my eyes for a little bit and just give into this swaying feeling. This goes on for a little bit. Then also, there’s this other round piece of flesh. It’s not really attached to the body, it’s another appendage. There’s one on either side of his bag. I can feel my hands fit overtop of it. I have one hand on either thing. At first I tense up a bit and think, “Oh my god, am I grabbing his butt?!” Then I open my eyes and look and see that it’s this other strange appendage. It feels like one of those stress balls that I’ve only ever seen in the store - I’ve never purchased one. There’s one in each of my hands. By letting my hands relax over them, it adds to the feeling of letting the tension leave my body. At one point I open my eyes and I see Omar. He’s looking through the doorway from the crowded room into the kitchen. He almost looks a little bit upset and I wonder why he’s upset. Then I wonder if maybe he’s jealous or feeling threatened somehow. Then my enjoyment and relaxation start to leave. Then after another few minutes I tell Randy that I want to get down now. So he sets me on my feet. Then he goes into that other room off the kitchen and the door closes and I can't see what or who is in there. Then I go back into the crowded room. Omar is talking to other people again. That feeling of alienation returns.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream1

My nephew who is training to be in Medical school - in fact he’s almost finished - has got a colander out of the cupboard and put three or four potatoes in it. He leaves it on the island and then leaves the kitchen. I think to myself: “Hmm, I guess I’m supposed to be making the mashed potatoes.” Instead of cooking them and mashing them with a potato masher, I poke them repeatedly with some sort of instrument that I have in my hand - it’s some kind of kitchen tool. I do this until they are little tiny pieces of potato in the colander. Two other members of my family (it’s fuzzy who they are) come in. They are criticizing the way I’ve done this and saying it won’t work. My nephew returns to the kitchen and says, “Oh yes, this will work. This is how I learned to do it at school. I’ve done this before. It’s fine.” Because he said that, the people who were criticizing me stop criticizing. Then the potatoes are cooked and they’ve turned out just fine.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream2
1116,1425,,07/08/2020,08/07/2020 00:05,"“The Murder” I’m in an outdoor space. It’s nighttime. There are seven or eight really long, long tables set up one after the other after the other, making a long row of tables. People are gathered around the tables; some are sitting, some are standing. I’m at the second table from the back. There is a series of movements that people have to execute and they’re being judged and marked. The people who are doing the judging and marking are friendly and conversational. They go from table to table making small talk. Then they ask people: “Are you ready then?” The people respond, “yes” or “no, not quite.” So if they say yes, they go up to a space that’s around the front table and do the movements. Then basically they clear out after that. But not everyone is leaving; there’s still a lot of friendly chit-chat going on along the sides of the table. I’ve noticed that the wave of people getting up and finishing is getting closer to my table. I tell the people that I’m sitting with that it’s almost our time and maybe we should rehearse. So we do. One of the people is a spotter and holds out an arm. You have to somersault overtop the arm and land on your feet. Then the third person pierces cartilage that runs down the side of our neck, like an aquatic gill, with an instrument. It has to be done at exactly the right spot, or it will hurt. If you put it in the right spot, it won’t hurt. This also has to be done quickly. This is why some people are missing or doing the somersault improperly so they don’t land in the right place and straighten up in the right place in order to have this piercing. So it’s our turn now. The person who is judging this does come around and says: “Are you ready?” We say yes. I’m doing the somersault. There’s a taller woman doing the holding out of the arm. Then I’m also doing the piercing. So we go up to the clearing in front of the table. I’m about to do the somersault when there’s a commotion at the back. I see this couple that I noticed earlier when we were practicing in the arena. The woman is very tiny. She has short, closed-cropped dark hair. Her partner is a lot taller than she is. They look very similar and I think they might be brother and sister. I realize that when they were practicing, they had this intimacy of movement, almost like there was no separation of being. I remember noticing them before during the practice - they were skating and doing this beautifully connected intimate dance. I was marveling at how smooth it was. The commotion is that she has murdered her partner or her brother. She’s really upset. Now the people that are responsible for this event are investigating. So the group I’m with has to return to our table - we weren’t able to execute our somersault and piercing. We go back to the table and are sitting there awaiting instruction. Of the ongoing investigation, the accusation is floating around that the woman deliberately killed her male partner. I’m thinking, “That can’t be right! How could it go from that beautiful and connected with the love that they shared change in that short period of time?” The investigation continues and there’s some talk between people. I can hear the people who were involved in the investigation reporting to each other. They are compiling a report. At first it seems like they’re gathering and will arrest her and take her away. She’s not actively sobbing, but she looks like she’s sobbing - her body posture looks like it’s sobbing but there is no sound coming out of her mouth and there are no tears coming out of her eyes. Suddenly someone else comes in with a question - they found something that discredits the conclusion that she murdered him and starts to report that it was an accident. Then the panic starts to settle down in the group. Some friends or family that she has are approaching her and taking her away with them. The kerfuffle starts to die down and it comes back to us that our turn is still next. We follow the crew of judges up to the area, properly execute the somersault and then I pierce the cartilage gill where I was supposed to, and we’re finished.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream3

The train was old-fashioned with red and white coloring. There was another train track beside ours, but for some reason, trains also stacked on top of one another such that one had to be careful when climbing on top of the train.  Eventually the train took us all to the ocean. The tracks went over the water for a ways before they dipped below the waves and we were under the sea. We were surprised that the train was air-tight. Eventually we got into the complex which was some sort of abandoned aquatic museum mixed with a military complex. It had a name which I remembered when I first woke up but have since forgotten.  I think we were actually fully submerged in the building yet we were able to breathe. We looked around. It was an open atrium with a bone-like structure made from a blue whale above us. It might have been supporting the building. There were hallways radiating out from us as if they were the blood vessels or organs of the whale.   Our mom wasn't with us and we had to go back to her or bring her with us--or just tell that we were safe. We left and that was when I had a conversation with my mom where one of us mentioned the name of the place. It had three words in it.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

Then I'm not where I’m supposed to be. At one point I’m on a giant bus instead of a boat… In one scenario, I’m down by a river and I’m watching some cargo be loaded into various boats. It’s actually really pretty. I’m standing in a forested area and the river isn’t very big. A woman gets on a smaller boat with two children. She stores the gear. It seems like somebody else is in front, but I don’t see him. She makes reference to him. People are saying: “Are you sure you should be going that way?” She’s a little bit rebellious and says something like: “I’m not a novice.” Then I can see that she has some kind of equipment on the stern. She folds it out. It’s actually quite fascinating because it folds up so neatly that you don’t really notice it on the stern. It’s got spring loaded parts to it. She folds it out and it snaps in place. Then there’s another fold in it and she folds that out and it snaps in place. She stands on the one in the back. Then her two kids run out and she places them on the one in the middle. It’s like ropes that go across and they’re hanging onto it with their feet braced on one part and their hands clinging to the other. She stands on the one in the back and the man she’s with - her partner or whatever - is still in the front. She says, “This is how I navigate the rapids.” Then I stand there and watch as the boat (it’s not driven, there’s no engine) is taken by the current. It seems to go a bit faster and everybody knows that there are rapids up ahead but we don’t see her go through them. In another scenario I’m loading things from a facility that also has things you can purchase. Apparently I’ve stored the gear I have to load in this facility. I have to load the things onto a giant motorhome. In order to take my stuff into the motorhome, I have to go up six little tiny creaky stairs and open up a trapdoor - it’s a small opening and it’s taking me a long time to do this. I noticed two giant spiders just prior to the trapdoor. One spider is flexing its legs and has a body that is two inches big and round and fat. It’s also flexing its wings like a dragonfly, only sharper and more angular. I think it’s interesting and I’ve never seen a spider like that. Then just beside it is this big fat web like a caterpillars tent. I’m thinking, “Oh I’m not taking my gear through there.” So I go through a door and exit out the front of the building. So it’s taking me longer to do this. When I finish, everyone else has their gear in the motorhome and have selected their beds. I’m counting people and counting beds and thinking we should have more beds than this, there are four of us going. Someone says, “Well, I want to keep some of the beds folded up so we have somewhere to sit and we can look at maps and stuff.” I say, “Oh, that’s a good idea.” Then I look around again and asking: “Who are all these made beds for? There isn’t one for me.” I find out that the people who are in couples have taken one bed each instead of a double bed. I mention this and say, “One of these beds needs to be for me because I’m going on this trip and you guys have made up all the beds.” Then Caroln, my ex-best friend says, “Well you’re sleeping with me.” I don’t really want to do that. Suddenly her parents are there and they’re in another bed. I say, “Which bed is yours?” I’m trying to correlate people with beds to see who belongs with all of these. Her parents are in a double bed, so that should be fine. Then there are three other beds made up, but no other people. Then I decide to sleep in a single bed in the back. Lisa tells me I can’t sleep there because of the sidewalk, whatever that means. Then there’s this other person who was supposed to be on the trip and she has one of the beds and is using another bed for her gear. Then I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

It’s a bunch of my sisters I regularly meet with on council. It’s a post-apocalyptic world. Things need cleaning up. I can see black smoking buildings in the background. It’s like we’ve hobbled together a kind of life out of the ruins of this thing. But I’m really clear that there are some things I need to take care of for my own life. As I’m walking away, I’m walking through this hallway with shopping carts littered everywhere. I’m passing by and heading to my own destination. One of my sisters is like, “Rose, come help me clean these carts. It’s something we need to do.” I get a sense of resentment because I know it needs to happen but I also need to get my own stuff done. So I start to clean the carts with her and then we move from doing that to getting in a vehicle with a bunch of supplies that need to be handed out and donated to other people. I know I’m doing things that need to be done and are helpful for others, but I have a long list of things I need to do but am not getting to and it’s really important that I do them.

What you have to do is really important.” I keep hearing that, but I’m not doing it and I keep staying with and keep getting pulled in. Now the truck we’re in gets stuck and it needs to be moved out. So my other friend says, “Okay now let’s get the truck out from where it’s stuck.” There are constantly things that are being added one thing after another because of course that’s life.

There’s something I have to do. I climb up onto a shelf that’s about eighteen inches wide and maybe four feet long. It’s tricky to get up there. There are other items on the shelf like it’s decorated for Christmas. There are pine bows and some Christmas cards. The arrangement goes up the wall and there are a lot of different cards that people have sent to my stepmother. While I’m up there, I crawl onto my hands and knees, then I lift my knees up and I’m in a downward dog. I realize I can’t back down and I’m stuck up there. I’m there for a really long time.

She says, “Okay, what can I do to get you down?” I ask her if she can move the items off the shelf. She carefully takes them down. There’s a glass dome - the kind that would go over a lamp - and all these other things I’m afraid of breaking. She takes them down one by one, thenI can get back down onto my knees, move my hands towards them, then back to the end of the shelf where I can dangle my legs over the edge, hang on with my hands, and kind of jump down the rest of the way. When I get down, I realize that the ornamentation has gone all the way down through the wall. She’s trying to give people some things to take home, so she has more things to put up there. I’m being asked if I can take some of the things home, but I don’t really want them. But I agree anyway. Then, people say it’s time to sit at the table.

I leave the table and go back into the living room and am looking at bookshelves. They are filed alphabetically. I think, “Well, her name starts with M, so If I look under M, maybe I’ll find something.” So I pull out this tiny book of Psalms. I look under M and it skips it - it goes from N to P, so I can't find M and O. I put that book back on the shelf and pull out another book that looks like it might be Psalms and poems. I pull it off and it says it’s M on the outside, but everytime I look at it, there are no M’s. I close the book and look at the spine and it does say M, so I’m looking through it again and feeling like I’m running out of time and people are going to be sitting down and I don’t have anything prepared! So now I’m just taking a random book and reading through the poetry. I think it doesn’t suit her, so I put it back. I think maybe I just didn’t read it properly because I was in such a rush and maybe it would have suited her. I pull another book off the shelf and do the same thing. Then I see that everyone is at the table, including her. Now I just have to wing it. I put the book back and go back to the table. I don’t know what to say. I’m feeling really stressed. When I sit down, there is all this sticky stuff on my forearms from the table. I start to brush it off. My brother says, “Oh, I took a long time putting that there and I liked it that way.” I say, “Oh sorry, I didn’t realize that was part of the decor. I thought it was just crumbs.” Then I’m trying to put it back and smear it around so it looks like it did before I was there. That’s when I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream2

It starts to get a little more sparse, then comes out into a clearing. There’s snow everywhere. I see up ahead of me a frost fencing and something that looks like it could be a building, although it’s mostly masked in snow. I walk through the snow towards the frost fencing. A man is standing there and he’s giving directions of some sort. He indicates that I am supposed to go straight ahead. As I’m walking through, other people start to gather. It’s getting a little more crowded. Then I remember I’m standing in a circle with people. I have something in my hand but i can’t see what it is. Other people are standing around and I know one of them - Blake. He gives me a bear hug and says, “It’s really good to see you.” As he lifts me up, my feet are off the ground. I can feel my body stretching - it feels like a full body stretch. When he sets me down, I wish he would do it again because the stretching felt really good. We’re being told to continue on our way towards the building. I notice the guys are wearing football uniforms - jerseys and pants. I wonder if I’m there for a game.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream3

It felt like it took place somewhere else entirely- no place I have ever been to in real life. The people I went to see in the dream were familiar to me in the dream but not in real life. I went to see a couple and I think in the dream I had known the male previously but it was years and years since I had seen him. When I got to their house we practiced yoga and I remember doing lots of hip openers and it was like I almost couldn’t get the deepest stretch because in everything I did, I was so flexible (this has not been the case in real life as I’ve not been able to practice like I used to). But the release that I felt from forward folds of all types was amazing - it was like I just folded into myself. I think I did a bunch of seated spinal twists, too. These are all things I can do in real life but for some reason in the dream I was like Gumby and I couldn’t find the tension to release half of the time. Then we all went to bed on the same bed, but it was not sexual. We just fell asleep and when we woke up we had to go somewhere so we scurried around getting ready and we were leaving. I needed to go back and do something like take my medicine or something like that. I messed up the covers and then I woke up.",Vera,last_nights_dream
1132,1215,,10/08/2020,08/10/2020 00:02,"There are a bunch of kids that I’m in charge of somehow. I’m a caretaker, but I’m not entirely sure how - I don’t know if I’m their mother or not. I’m needing to get them to a safer place. I have a little bit of help. There are hallways where I’m trying to gather them up from and get them on a bus so they can be in a safer spot. I’m really clear that I don’t want that responsibility. I’m going to make sure they get where they need to go, but after that the choices I make are going to have a lot less to do with being their caretaker 24/7. These are not my kids. These are just random children. I can't tell if it’s a school or daycare or something. It’s everybody’s children, but they are not of my body. So, there are other people around who are also caretaking them and trying to get them to wherever they need to go. There’s just this feeling of needing to get them to a safe place. We get them somewhere, but I drift out of the scene somehow. I end up trying to find a home for myself. My beloved is with me now. We’re looking at houses - they are the same houses we were looking for for the kids. We were looking at a dormitory or something for them to live in. i’m looking for a house for myself. I’m clear that I only want enough house for me and one other person to come stay with me whenever they want. They find a cute house. I can only see the inside of it. It’s in a neighborhood kind of like the one I grew up in, but I can't really see the outside of it. There are cute cupboards. There isn’t a lot of space because it’s just me. There is a lot of wood paneling on the inside. I’m trying to decide if I’m going to be there. Then we go out of the house and all of a sudden there’s water everywhere - ocean. I’m collecting shells and I can see down to the bottom of the ocean. It’s really clear. I’m trying to collect the shells and I drop one and watch it sink down to the bottom. I’m trying to gauge the depth of the water based on how small the item looks, but water magnifies it so i can’t tell the true depth of the water. So I’m looking at this one shell that I dropped which then turns into a shoe. I’m like, “That’s not my shoe. I don’t want the shoe, I want my shell. The shells are prettier.” My beloved is there and he’s helping me collect these shells and I have a few. Then the scene morphs. That one shoe takes me to another scene. I’m carrying bags of trash. It’s actually not trash - it’s stuff I’m getting rid of, all these clothes and things I used to have or need but now I don’t. It includes pairs of shoes. The trash bags go in the trashcan and the pairs of shoes go on top of the trashcan. I’m back in a neighborhood again and I’m taking the trash over to my neighbor’s house so she can look at it. I take out one bag of trash and only one shoe, one of my snow boots. I go get another bag of stuff and the other boot goes on top of the can. Then I get a third bag and there’s one more shoe - I don’t remember what kind of shoe. I see these three shoes and then all of a sudden I’m done with this and want to dance. I want to dance like the way break dancers dance with all body weight and where you go upside down a lot. But I’m not very good at it. This area where I was taking the trash bags to changes into an amphitheatre with no walls. There are lights being projected. I’m moving my body and it’s really awkward in the beginning. My body hurts, I don’t have the strength for some of the moves, I can’t think of some of the moves I want to do, I don’t have much flow and my body is really jerky. At some point I see myself in a mirror - these mirrors have shown up as part of the walls even though it’s a completely outdoor space. I have short deep auburn red hair. At one point, scratches appear on my back. I’m like, “Oh no no, we’re not going that direction!” I somehow wipe the scratches off my back as an observer, then I go back into my body and try to dance. I think there’s part of me that is still in the observer role because I’m watching myself dance in the mirror. Suddenly the mirrors turn a brilliant turquoise blue. They become the background. There’s also granite rock mountains in the back. I feel something click in my body and brain and I let go. I’m suddenly dancing fluidly and my body becomes a lot more muscular. I suddenly have the musculature to be upside down and doing handstands with splits and backflips and a lot of break dance moves where you spin on your shoulders and flip in the air. My legs are really strong. Everything is really really strong. This background of turquoise teal blue is bright like an electric vibrant brightness and the granite rock is reflected in the mirror somehow with me also reflected in the mirror doing dances to some music I can hear.",Rose,last_nights_dream

Some are drinking, some are talking and some are sitting quietly by themselves. I start propelling myself through the water with my arms. I feel so free and strong and good in my body, propelling myself from side to side, from one end of the pool to the other. I observe people talking and flirting and some high on drugs.

The thought does go through my mind of why aren’t you running this marathon? I don’t want to run 26 miles, but I keep wondering if I could do it. A man is running beside me and asking where to go. I show him how he has to go down the street to the turn around point up ahead and then run back the other way. He goes and there are a bunch of younger women who run by me and I show them the path, too. Then I follow the path because the path heads down away from my house and then goes to the turnaround and comes back. So I turn around and come back towards my place.

I’m with my dad and we’re looking at a flyer that says something like: a couple tokens to do this talk with Mexican-Americans to hear their side of the story and get anti-racism training. My dad pays the money, but nothing happens and no one shows up. It’s a little mind boggling. We continue on and go see some other events. At one point, we’re in a car traveling and I’m the driver. I don’t know if I should be driving because I feel under the influence of something, not alcohol. I’ve got some friends in the back and maybe a sibling or two. At one part I drive over a bridge. The bridge is made of wood and it’s really, really high. I think there is water beneath the bridge. As I’m driving over it I think I should not be driving and I’m not safe to drive. We get over the bridge and I’m sweating because it’s freaking me out. We get to a downtown area where the buildings are close, the streets are narrow, and there are a lot of pedestrians. I’m very anxious to get the car parked back at the house becuase I’m scared I’m going to kill someone or everyone in the car. I still don’t know what I’m on or why I have this anxiety around driving. Eventually we do get back to the house. I get out of the car. A bunch of people go inside. I go inside for a second. The house is interesting - it’s a very Victorian era looking house on the outside and inside. It’s got a lot of space - the ceilings are tall, which kind of contradicts the Victorian era architecture because the houses are usually kind of small on the inside. I’m inside for a little bit. I go to the backyard and the area where the Mexican-American anti-racism talk was supposed to happen is actually happening in the backyard. The landscape changes from town to lush woodland. The sign or billboard that announced the event is in the middle of the backyard. A tree is growing in the corner. I go hang out by this tree. The tree is actually a Mexican-American woman. I think she is Mexican-American, but she could be from some other part of South America, I’m not entirely sure, I just know she’s Latina. She has been in this tree the whole time. She comes out of the tree and we are dialoguing. She is scolding me for not doing what I was supposed to do in terms of my anti-racism work. But it’s more than that! As she becomes more human and less tree, the place where she was standing in the corner of the yard starts to fill with water. There’s a rocky waterfall in this back corner, too. I’m lying down on a mattress. I was trying to lie down under this tree while in conversation with this woman because there is something she’s supposed to be teaching me that I’m supposed to be learning. But where her roots were, the water keeps filling. At first it’s just a little trickle, and I scooch to the side to get out of the way. Then there’s more. The air mattress I was lying on starts to get soaked and I pull it out of the way. She is also trying to get out of the way. Then suddenly in this back corner of the yard that had nothing but this dry old tree woman is suddenly luscious and completely verdant. There are plants and ferns growing everywhere and there’s a spring where she was. The water is the sweetest water you’ve ever tasted; it’s so clear and refreshing. Now it’s overflowing out of the pond and moving down because this back corner of the yard was on top of a hill. So the water starts to flow down and it’s touching everything that was really dry. Everything about the town was also really dry - there weren't a lot of green growing things. So the water is moving down this hill and the whole backyard and surrounding areas change from this dry almost desert place to this green luscious verdant place. The whole backyard becomes a sanctuary. The tree woman and I keep trying to move out of the water, which is somehow creating a bond between us. In the beginning it was really hard for us to talk to each other; I was on the defence and she was attacking. But as we are together trying to move out of the water, there is a softening where she is more willing to talk to me and I’m not as scared to listen to her and hear what she has to say. We become friends. It’s interesting the way we start to weave together. We’re still in the backyard and there are also parrots with us. One of the parrots is talking to me. Eventually the woman wants to go walk downtown and go for dinner. We walk out together to the town. The town is actually kind of dirty and gross. We ask some people for directions to a really good dinner place. This guy tries to give us directions, then says, “Never mind, I’m just going to take you.” So he does. We follow him to this dinner place.",Rose,last_nights_dream

The rabbit dashed off into the woods. Neither of us made any attempt to do anything, which I thought was odd. My dad, who was outside, rushed after the rabbit as it ran into the woods.

He is sitting across this really big table from me. All of a sudden I see him lift his hand and I can feel this force coming from his hand and he’s pushing against me. This whole time we were talking about some of things I can do, and he said, “Oh yeah, watch this. Can you do this?” I feel a force or pressure from his hand as if someone is pushing on me. It’s not malicious or anything; he’s just trying to show me what he can do. I’m shocked because I can’t do it and I feel a little embarrassed that I should be able to do this but I can’t. Then he goes: “Okay now, watch this.” There’s a billboard that comes up across and squares and diamonds start appearing at the top and he’s making this happen. In the dream, I have this recognition that I haven’t seen him in a long time and he went somewhere then came back and can do all this cool stuff. Then the dream shifts. We’re on land now.

In the back of my mind I know that there is a mission we’re going on. We’re still on land. We’re sitting on a huge fallen log. We’re all getting our assignments for what we’re supposed to do. We’re each getting assigned a bag to carry. These bags have supplies and whatnot. I’m watching the person in charge. They have a big clipboard and they’re assigning some of the newbies (people I don't know at all) sleeping gear. One of the bags has a sleeping bag in it, but they’ve also put rocks in it to make it extra heavy. Everyone is giggling and laughing because it’s a joke. I think I’m supposed to play along with this joke and laugh hahaha, but I don’t. There is a sense of peer pressure that I need to laugh about it. I’m a little confused about this whole thing. I’m not even sure where we’re supposed to be going. At one point my mom shows up and says, “Okay, you’re on this mission and you've got to do these things.” Other people are telling me all these things I’m supposed to be doing as my role in this mission.

We drove by an outdoor jewelry store (all stores have moved outside) and I thought I saw people taking things and commented that if I was security I would have to be careful not to assume everyone was guilty. Then I was in an apartment with a woman who reminded me of a famous actress and people from work - we were going to make a meal for everyone and it was a big deal. We wore name tags and I had a bandaid on my finger that kept slipping off. The woman was annoyed with me...she was very polished. When we were all settled I pulled four Oracle tree cards for the table and then went around the table to have people pull their cards based on the four I pulled, and read them. I got to the first person and then the second person was the security guard at my unit, this huge guy named Arshis. He’s been in my dreams before. He pulled a card I knew what it would be because when I pulled it I knew it was his, and I said “I knew you would pull that card!” And I started to read it but couldn’t pronounce some of it. It was in Polynesian and then I said “love.” He looked out the window and there was smoke billowing out of the windows of the building to the right of us, like a c-shaped building, and we all went back to our rooms to change and grab our bags to evacuate.

1196,1745,,22/08/2020,08/22/2020 00:05,"I was at a doctor's appointment in an unfamiliar office. I had just returned to the waiting room where I sat down and waited for the lady at the check-out area to call me so that I could leave. After sitting for a while and not being called, I began to worry that I was sitting in the wrong place and had to go approach the check-out window myself. I did this and as I approached, I found that I was not wearing a shirt but instead had a large blanket wrapped around my torso and mouth. When I came to the window, I the receptionist mistook me for a lesbian lady who was one of the patients there. She asked me something about my medical history and I became curious. I asked her to clarify her question and provide more details and soon found out that I could discover much about this person. I was very curious, but knew that this was wrong. I overcame my curiosity and made clear who I was. The receptionist asked why I was wearing the blanket around my mouth to which I responded by telling her that I didn't have a mask. She handed me a large, sturdy, grey and pink N95-style mask which I examined. I am not sure if I put it on.  I walked out of the doctor's office onto the street. It was mid-day and sunny. My moped was out front and I began to ride home on it, but began to have difficulty driving. My vision was not good enough to drive on the 4 lane road which runs through the center of the small town where I used to live. I kept trying to ride the moped but would have to stop because of traffic. Eventually, I discarded the moped and began walking in the middle of the road against oncoming traffic, darting between cars, and generally causing havoc. I was aware at one level that this must be a dream because I would never be doing this in normal waking life.  The dream transitioned, but I was still walking home and wearing a large red blanket as my only covering for my upper body. I was also barefoot. I walked along a sidewalk in a more rundown part of town and seeing the houses on my left and smelling the aroma of marijuana wafting toward me could tell that I wasn't in one of the nicer neighborhoods. I thought about how many people in the country must have lives like this. Getting up in the morning, working a job they hate, returning to a dilapidated house and smoking a few joints to relax and forget how meaningless their lives are.  It was then that I was approached by a young man in his late teens. He had dark hair and looked like Gendry from Game of Thrones. He approached me and asked me if I wanted drugs. I did not, but I followed him to his house anyway. I don't remember much of what the house looked like from the outside, but it had a brown and orange rusted metal door which opened outward. He opened it and I stepped in. I felt a sense of darkness enveloping me when I entered as I knew that no good could come of this and I wasn't sure why I was even doing it as I didn't actually want drugs.   Inside, I found what must be my mind's representation of what a crack-house must look like. It was spacious with cinder block walls and a concrete floor littered with trash. It was not completely filthy but was still very dirty. To my left were two babies wearing only diapers. One was only lying on the floor, but the other was just old enough to be crawling. On the far side of the room were four or five younger children. There were two boys from 10 to 13 years of age and two girls who were slightly younger. I remember one of the boys having black hair and one of the girls having blonde. To my right there was a pedestal or pillar on top of which sat the statue of a nude female slightly on the larger side, sitting on her knees. One of the girls approached her offering something to her. I am now a bit confused as to whether the statue was living or not. The ritual seemed to have sexual connotations.   I was again offered drugs which I refused but this time also sex. I too refused that as my identity as a Christian was very strong and I wanted to behave admirably and also be of some help in the terrible situation I faced. When it became clear that I was not interested in the activities that this house offered, one of the girls, the blonde one of about 10 came up to me on my left side, hugged me, and held onto my hand. She became attached to me and was very sweet. It was if I had earned a kind of respect from all of the children for not falling into temptation. I still wondered if they were only treating me this way because they were being paid to. I also couldn't help but wonder if the babies that I saw were the offspring of the boys and girls who I saw in front of me, but as I thought about this, I saw that they must be the grandchildren of the uncles of one of the children present. I saw an image of his face for a moment.  I could see that this was a place of great suffering and meaninglessness, so I asked one of the girls who I believe was lying on the lower bunk of a bed if she was happy with her life here. She gave a noncommittal response but I was sure that they were not happy here.  As the outsider, I somehow established myself as the much-needed figure of the father and of moral authority.  Later, I was outside at night with the older boys and a drug deal was going down. They had received a collection of immensely heavy bags, which were either filled with gold, or a yet heavier and costlier material. I was horrified at what I taking part of, yet I still helped carry a bag back to the house. I again at this time knew that it must be a dream because I would never help in this circumstance in reality. When we got back to the house, the young man and one of the younger boys with blonde hair had a disagreement and the older boy rushed at the younger and plunged a knife into his neck, killing him.  At this point, I wanted to leave, but the young man told me that I couldn't, indicating that I would meet the fate of the younger boy if I attempted to escape. Not only that, but all of the younger children were setup to guard me, though it was clear that they wanted me to stay not only because I might call the cops on them if I left but because they liked me and needed someone like me around.   We were out in the backyard of the house and it was evening. The children were playing and I joined in, but I was also following the young man around and imploring him to let me go. I gave him my word that I would tell no one of the things that I had seen and that he knew that he could trust me based on my character. I meant it too. I was not going to say anything, and if this situation were to happen in real life, I would have stuck by that promise. The killing and overall situation did not have the same moral weight they would have in waking life. He laughed when I said this, but I could tell that he did believe in my honesty. He refused to let me go, and I continued to implore him to let me go, but to also change his ways. I entered a long monologue where I told him that he had to become responsible and get a job not only for his sake but for the sake of the children. He was dismissive but again I could tell that he knew what the right thing to do was.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

Gai’s husband is sitting further behind her on the ground and listening into the conversation. The whole situation makes me feel uneasy. Then I see that Irene has found a new lover in her building. She’s wearing a long fitted lace red gown and is excited to go meet him. Then she changes her clothes to a grey silk deep plunging gown over black slacks.

We were outside of a shopping complex near the school and the cops had decided to do a drug test of everyone coming out of one of the grocery stores. Everyone who came out was wearing a green shirt which was the brand color of the store. There was some legal precedent allowing the cops to target only the people from this store. It may have been a store policy. I had not been shopping there but was still not going to have any of it. I joined all of the shoppers who had lined up and were approaching the cop in order to be drug tested. The others told me to get out of line since there was no need for me to go through all of this since I hadn't been in the store. They told me that if I was seen with them, the cops would not care that I hadn't been in the store. But I wanted to make a scene and to take a stand. I walked up to where the cops were and then kept on walking.  ""Stop right there,"" one of the cops said to me. He looked an awful lot like a friend  who had been my RA in college. I had respected him as an authority figure and as a friend.  ""I wasn't in the store, so you have no legal grounds for making me do a drug test."" I answered.  ""Why are you with the shoppers then?""  ""It doesn't matter. I wasn't in the store and you can't make me take a drug test. I'm going to walk away now. Are you going to arrest me?""  I walked away and he came after me. Somehow I ended up in his car, though I hadn't been arrested, and he began to discuss with me how I needed to respect the law and be a good citizen. I obviously gave him a piece of my mind given that I was a good citizen and that he was clearly in the wrong for drug testing people when this was an oversight of peoples' privacy and many drugs could be beneficial. Still, the atmosphere of the dream was that I was the wayward citizen being implored by the wise cop to reform my ways.

The top was a big meeting type area and if you hiked down about halfway there was a pool and hot tub in the woods with cool lights, and then another mile down was the ocean. Imagine like a tropical Esalen with a mile between cliffs and beach where you could reach the beach safely and warm enough to swim all the time. The first part of my dream I was exploring this landscape alone and barely came across other people. The second time the dining area had reopened and I was in line for dessert and there was cheesecake, but everything looked fake, like not real food. The next time I was there for a weekend with a group of people, all younger than me. We went all the way down to the ocean water and it was pitch black but we lit it up somehow by swirling around in the water, and people were standing and sitting on the edge watching us. It was provocative but not blatantly sexual; it felt more like we were sharing love than having sex but to outsiders, someone commented when we were walking back up “thanks for the show, I’ve been here 60 years and never seen one like that.” I felt embarrassed at the time, like they thought we were disinhibited on drugs or drunk but we weren’t. Then we started walking to the top and it wasn’t nighttime anymore but no sun; it was all gray. There were people who looked homeless (holding small signs) seated wedged in with people enjoying the view. There was an ex boyfriend of mine from high school and I went to say hi. He made a comment about me being seen down below and something about white girls (he is black If this is something meaningful) and seemed angry with me. This was not the response I would expect after 20 plus years of not seeing each other. Then there were more people out and I started walking towards the entrance when three people with huge banners came tumbling down into the crowd and someone yelled “get them out of there! Here we go again!” and it was the people carrying the small sign who were kicking out the big banner people. At the same time a police van pulled in with a man wearing gold spray on pants (you could see where they were coming off) and he was saying “just call my PO,” with a bit of a twangy accent. I looked up at the sky and it was grey/green muted and I felt like I was watching a movie. When I looked down I was back in my apartment but with that same group - one other woman and two men and we were trying to decide what to do. I don’t think I know them in real life but they were familiar. I remember feeling out of my element and too old to hang out with them and kind of wanted to just have them leave, then I woke up.",Vera,last_nights_dream

Spider webs everywhere. A spider landed on my face and I couldn't get it off like it was Velcro. It was huge, like a tarantula. My sister tried to get it off but couldn’t. I clawed at it on my forehead and pulled off a leg but it still wouldn’t budge. Finally it crawled to the top of my head and my sister pulled it out and threw it.

This Japanese royalty shows up with a lot of people - multiple cars full of Japanese royal family. Up until they arrived, we were all just playing and having a good time. When they arrive, it’s almost as if they’re watching us play. There are at least forty or fifty of them. They’re all sitting at these long tables. I go up to talk to them with the little bit of Japanese I know. This seems to delight everyone. This festival quality comes into the air - celebration is happening. They’re really happy to observe us having a good time. We’re going to do some dances and put on a show. I’m like, “Oh, I’m in my play clothes and they’re dirty, so I’m going to go get dressed up for dancing on stage.” I go to get dressed up and I can’t find any clothes that I like or that fits or looks good. I find a pair of mom jeans that do not look attractive. Then I look in the mirror and am like, “What is wrong with my face?” My face looks really old and weird. And my hair is short. I’ve got this short mom haircut that is not attractive. The hair is dark and I’m thinking, “Oh, what if dyed it?” So, I think I’ll dye it blonde. When I look in the mirror my hair is suddenly blonde with crazy root grow out.Then I’m like, “No, that doesn’t look good. I don’t like that. What if I turn the blonde part pink and the roots turn purple?” I look in the mirror and sure enough, my hair turns that color. So my hair looks cute, but it’s kind of straw’ish - like what happens when you color your hair a lot. But when I look at myself, I think, “Wow, you’re really trying whatever you can to look cute for these dances on stage, but you don’t.” I’m being pretty harsh on myself. One of my friends, an instructor friend from pole studio, runs in and says, “There are only a couple of numbers left. We keep missing you. We’re ready for you to come dance!” I’m like, “Okay, okay, I’ll be there. I just need to get some clothes on that look good.” But I never find anything that looks good. I just go out of this room and can see the stage where they’re all dancing. I can see the Japanese royalty watching. I watch them dance and miss all the dances. It makes me sad because I really want to dance, but I also feel really not myself, like this mom body, mom haircut, mom face, mom jeans. I don’t understand why suddenly “mom” is a derogatory term in my head. I guess I feel dumpy. So that happens. Then the scene changes. I’m in a house with a different set of friends and we’re all sitting on a couch. My friend Aila is there and my other friends who I’m on council with. We’re talking about my new relationship. I’m saying what has happened and how I handled it. I’m asking if I missed anything or if I handled it in a healthy way. I’m getting feedback from them. At one point, I ask Aila, “Is this lust and infatuation and some sort of misguided spiritual projection? Or is this really love?” Aila looks at me and she says, “Oh no, Rose, it’s really love.” I go, “Okay,” and I get up and grab my phone and show her a picture I have of the two of us so she can see. I had a feeling all along that it was really love, too, but there’s a part of me that is constantly second guessing. But before I can show her the picture, a friend from high school named Janet shows up. Janet is half Japanese, half German. She is like, “I’m coming to join the council! I just have these other things to do and I haven’t gotten to it yet.” We’re looking up at her and are like, “Okay, great. Get here when you get here.” It seems like a strange interruption because in real life, she’s not actually part of the council, but it doesn’t seem to matter. We’re sitting on this couch in a house and there’s stuff going on around us with people coming and going, but I don’t know who the people are or what they’re doing - it’s just noise and bodies in the background.

He doesn’t say anything but I know it’s him and I feel somewhat comforted by the presence of someone I know. We walk for a little while, quite close together because the crowd is that thick.

We walk like this for some moments. Then, the band has arrived. People are starting to organize in seats. For some reason there are theatre seats lined up in rows.

Jared left as I went up to the the third floor with Daniel while we looked around the bare room that we had once called home. The semester was just starting and we saw that other students were just beginning to move in and get situated. For some reason, I was sure that I had left something behind in the room from when I had moved out, so we began a careful search. We found a handful of things that I had missed, but not the one or two that I was sure that I had misplaced. Among these was a notebook and a pocket knife, my old Buck knife.  I brought all of the things we found home to my parents' house and sorted through them there. One of the objects was a mini air hockey table with a black and white checkers type game on the reverse side. Inside of the table was some empty space and looking there I found my missing items. I wasn't sure how I could have been so careless as to leave them behind in the first place.  Back on the road with Jared, it was raining and we stopped at a red light. An old homeless man approached Jared's window and whacked it so hard with his hand that it almost shattered, and developed several spider-web cracks. I was apprehensive but Jared rolled down his window and spoke with the man for a moment before it became clear that he was up to no good. We took off but were worried that he and the others who were likely with him would come after us. They did come after us.  We got to a motel where we got out and hid inside hoping that they wouldn't have spotted us. But in following true dream logic, they knew exactly where we were. One man came in, and I believe he was carrying a handgun, though I am not certain. I told Jared to run back and call the police, while I grabbed a small, but sharp kitchen knife from the counter. The man entered the front door and grabbed one of the civilians standing nearby. I rushed at him with the knife and may have stabbed him. I was afraid for my life, but I didn't have much choice but to go on the offensive. He was stunned enough that he left at least for the time being. Jared didn't want to call the police, so I ended up having to. I told them what had happened and they assured us that if we made it to the city of Charleston, or then some city in Pennsylvania, that we would be safe. We were not headed toward Charleston, however, as we were travelling north, and Pennsylvania was quite a ways off still.  We hit the road again.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

1212,911,,26/08/2020,08/26/2020 00:01,"A really sinister feeling deram. I’m at a retreat center. The lodging is more like a dormitory, almost like Esalen with multiple bunk beds in each room. All the rooms are lined up in one long building. There’s a priest figure who’s either leading the retreat is a guru for this retreat center community. He’s a combination of different energies, including Swamiji. There are quite a few people gathered, some remind me of people from high school and others from college. There’s also my husband and me. My husband is upset and distant from me. He’s talking with other circles of people. I go into my room that I share with a group of people. I am witness to a murder and brainwashing. I’m not entirely brainwashed though, so I see it for what it is. It’s really disturbing. The priest is there. His assistant is with him. I feel sick to my stomach and don’t want to remember what I saw. They manipulate this young man, making him into a zombie-like state, then kiss all the life out of him. The people continue to do their things - folding clothes, brushing teeth, getting dressed. I hear the priest and his assistant talking about what to do with the body. The assistant says, “This may have to be the last one for awhile because there might be some questions about the accident.” They plan to frame his death as a fall down the cliffs. I try to behave like the others to get away. I have a sense they’ve picked up on my more aware and attentive consciousness. I’m desperately looking for my husband to tell him because he’s one of the only ones I feel I can confide in now. I see him sitting on a bench with a small group of people. I want to draw him away so I can speak with him, but he doesn’t want to leave this group. He may somehow be involved with the deception somehow. The scene shifts. It seems like a month or so has passed. The same people are here. But now they are circulating around higher society at a symphony gala. They’re still doing the same sinister plotting and killing. Somehow they end up in the same location as me. I cross paths with them in the kitchen. More time has passed or maybe this is before. I’m going to a little library for a book reading and meditation. It’s in a neat geodesic dome. There’s an attic area upstairs with a woman who deceived my husband. The library has a collection of rare spiritual and magical books - not what you’d normally find in a library. This has been built as someone’s home and then later turned into a place for the public. I’m meeting with a small group of women. We’re sitting on the couch waiting for somebody. I recognize them from waking life, but they are distinctly different from their waking life appearance - shorter hair, heavier, odd voice, strange style of dress. They decide to begin. Usually I’m the one to begin, but Beth and Sherry begin instead. Beth takes out a long curved brown dried leaf with an incense stick and a white piece of copal. But then Shnati smiles and pops the copal in her mouth like a piece of candy. They light the incense and begin. Somebody sings a song. Then the scene changes. I’m setting up a beach blanket with my mom, sister and son. It’s a lovely day. I’m watching a young Indian mother and her child play in the water. She’s round and full in her body, so is he. They go out into the waves during a lull. Others are swimming in the water. Then suddenly a big wave rises up out of the ocean. The wave swallows the mother and son, then it rushes up to our towel. It washes my Kindle away along with my bags, shoes and son. I’m scrambling waiting for the waves to calm so I can find everything and hoping the water returns it all. My son is okay. My Kindle is buried partially under the sand, still in its case. It’s okay. We move our towels up where there is a young gay couple on their towel. We’re close to them, but we will all move soon and have more space between us.",Ana,last_nights_dream
1213,1221,,26/08/2020,08/26/2020 00:02,"Wild dreams! I’m hanging with my brother, the one born right after me. We go into a bar because he wants a drink, but I’m not drinking. We walk into this bar and it’s a two-story high bar and I can see a balcony where I can see the second story. It’s wood paneling, so the bar is dark and very masculine. There are deer heads on the wall and the tables are round and wooden. It kind of reminds me of a saloon, like a cliche Western. We walk up to the corner of the bar so my brother can order his drink. I turn around and see three guys who I haven't seen in a long time. One of the guys is a classmate of mine and also grew up on the same street as me. I haven’t seen him since we graduated. I'm like, “Oh my god! Hi! How are you?!” He’s really tall, taller than me and I’m 5’10” so he’s 6’4” or 6’5” so I’m definitely looking up at him. There’s also my friend Johnny who I grew up with in the same neighborhood, though we didn’t go to school together. I knew him the whole time growing up. There’s one other person, maybe Ikaika, another classmate who I’ve known since second grade. They come and stand behind me. They’re ordering drinks over my shoulder to the bartender. Initially I'm like, “Oh my gosh, hi, it’s so good to see you all!” Then they’re like, “Hey!” My former high school classmate starts asking me these condescending questions like: “How are you and what are you doing in your life? What have you accomplished?” I’m like, Whoa! This took a turn that I wasn’t expecting. They’re standing over me so I’m definitely feeling attacked and defensive. I don’t know if I get up on a chair or suddenly have super powers, so I can hover above them. But I get above them, the bartender and my brother and I’m like, “And what are you all doing with your life? Are you guys looking at your misogynistic beliefs and your sexist behaviors? What are you doing to undo the patriarchy and fight for social justice? How are you looking at your biases and your beliefs?” I’m asking specifically about their racial and gender biases and beliefs. I’m hovering over them as I say that. Then I just leave the bar because I’m disgusted with how they initially talked to me. I just didn’t want anything to do with them afterwards. As I was talking to them I could see they didn’t understand what I was talking about at all. They did not get the concept of biases or patriarchy or any of that. Complete scene change. Now I’m observing. There are a bunch of people who have been in a white van that you always see in the news. It’s like these forces are coming after the people in the van. The only three people I know for sure are the driver, Donny who does my taxes, Johnny with his wife Amanda who I've known since second grade and their kids. I’m also in the van, participating and observing. I have a sense of other people in the van. We’re trying to get somewhere and Donny is driving super crazy over snow, through woods, across rivers. There’s very little road driving happening in this first part. We are totally besieged. There are people or things not of this world that are coming after us and trying to kill us, literally trying to wipe us out. So we get to Johnny’s mansion. We are beat up. Some of us are dead. Not everyone in the van made it. The creatures that were going after us are still going after us. They gave us just long enough of a break to go inside the house and regroup to make a plan. We make our plan. I hear myself saying: “You have to keep the windows rolled up. You cannot stop for anything. You have to drive fast until we get to where we’re going.” I don’t know where our destination is. I don’t know why we’re running from these things, some of which do look human. I don’t know what our goal is. As we’re in the mansion, those creatures start to come in. I keep seeing black tar being spit out of their mouths and if the tar touches us, we die. So, we all run out of the house. We have a new white van because the old one got really beat up and just didn’t work anymore. So we all pile into this white van. I’m like, “Okay, everyone roll up the windows. Donny, go as fast as you can. Don’t stop for anyone or anything. Just keep going.” This is the part where we drive through multiple scenes or landscapes. At first we’re driving through a town. When we drive through town, there’s an Asian man who’s sitting next to me in the van and he cracks his window a little bit. I start yelling at him because I can see on the right side of the car a pair of twin women with dark hair, but their bodies don’t move like humans. You can tell they’re something else. One of them spits on the windshield. Donny wipes the spit off with the windshield wiper fluid. The spit is an orange color. I’m expecting it to melt through the window at any moment, but it doesn’t. When Donny uses the windshield wiper fluid and because the guys’ window is down, some of the fluid comes in through the window and hits his eyes. His eyes start to burn. I look at him and his eyes are the goldish yellow color of the spit. I’m like, “I told you to keep the window closed. Here’s another casualty that could have been avoided.” Donny slows down. These twin women start telling us, “Okay, if you’re going to survive this, you have to go.” I’m like, “Yeah, I know!” I’m trying to tell Donny to go. Now it’s raining and the pavement is wet. We see the road in front of us is blocked by some of these things or people that are trying to get us. Donny swerves off and he goes over a railroad track. I don’t know how the van makes it over the railroad track. He swerves around this big piece of metal in our path. Then he swerves around other people and other cars. We’re going through forests. We seem to be under attack this whole time. There are a couple children in the van with us. We’re really trying to keep those children safe. This is part of the whole mission, though I have no idea what the point of this mission is. It’s really wild and there’s a lot of pressure.",Rose,last_nights_dream
1214,1433,,26/08/2020,08/26/2020 00:03,"“Olive Oil” I’m not really anywhere physical. I feel like I am the macro and the micro sensation of passing of time. There’s a physical feeling of motion, of waves, of something small like iotas touching my skin and letting me know that I have a physical body that exists somewhere. Because my eyes cannot really see anything but daylight itself, I attend to the feeling on my skin to determine where I am. I sense rather than see a wooden floor, a planked wooden floor and walls also made of wood. It’s like I can feel vibration. I’m now sensing that there are other people and I sense an elderly man with the energy of a patriarch, but loving like a grandfather; then that softer more active love of a matriarch or grandmother. They have family. I can feel they are tied together by the vibrational quality of love, affection, interaction, and connection. They are bubbly. There’s joy here. There's also a sense of industry and cooperation. I feel now that there is a rhythm in the dynamic of their extended family. At the same time as I’m sensing into this, I’m feeling like the whole scenario is moving forward. As I deepen into their family dynamic, I start to see more colors and form. I start to see that they’re seated, they’re boisterous and talking to each other. It’s almost like it’s a mealtime, though they aren’t eating food. They’re passing around something in a cup. Their family is colorful. There’s something wrapped around the woman’s head. There’s the draping of brightly colored cotton clothing, although the man seems to be wearing a shirt. I notice their skin is glowing. There’s a sense of emanating light. Then I think that their whole skin is softer and more radiant, even of the family members’ whose arms and hands I can see. I seem to be zooming in and noticing that the hands are luminescent. It suddenly clicks in my mind that I can smell olive oil. Then, it further connects that what they are passing around in the cup is olive oil and there’s this joy that they have in this olive oil. I realize they’ve produced it together and it’s what is making their skin so luminous. Then, I can feel the vibration of the olive trees through the wood. I’m thinking or feeling that the planked floor also comes from the olive tree and that this forward motion, this macro-sensation is the journey of the olive itself and the family that gathered around it to tend it. As I start to ascend from the wooden planked room with the family who tends the olive, I’m sensing how disconnected this is now that it’s moved forward through time and becomes the glassy cage of the olive.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I got in a pickup truck with the farmer and we drove down one of the ledges and almost got stuck. I had my right foot outside of the door and had to bring it back in to avoid it getting crushed.

To my right is a bridge going over water and also a boardwalk. I don’t know if the water is lake or ocean, but I just know there’s water off to my right. There are these big crowds of people because there’s a marathon or a parade happening. I’m walking through it one direction. Then I get to a point and have to turn around. Now the water is on my left and I start running like I’m in the parade or marathon. I think veterans are running and people on the sidelines are cheering them on. I’m running to this shop in one of the older buildings. The shop is run by my friend. She’s doing a clearance or inventory reduction sale. I’m helping her carry racks of clothes out the backdoor of the shop and down two sets of stairs to what would be the basement but it’s outside. So I go out the backdoor of the shop and these steps are outside. I walk down one flight, hit a landing, walk down a second flight and hit another landing. This second landing is below ground but it’s open, and there’s a door that goes into her basement. My head is at street level now, so when I look up I can see everybody’s feet. There are a bunch of younger women who are dancers, singers and artists. The shop owner is like, “Yeah, come get some of this inventory.” I don’t know if she’s charging them less or giving them away for free. I’m just carrying this rack of clothes down and putting it down, and I see all these young women and they’re all adorable and gorgeous. One of them is Maria. She’s wearing all black and she has this black hat on sideways. These young women are singing while they’re going through the clothes. I’m surprised to see Maria and surprised to hear the singing. I kind of wnat to join in but I don’t know the words. The scene changes with them all rummaging through and Maria leaving - she saw me and was like, “Oh, I’m out.” So then the scene changes to another outdoor area - a food truck area. I see a bunch of friends from high school around an outdoor table. The table is round. My friend Janet is there - she’s half Japanese and half German. There are also some younger men who I don’t recognize. I’m observing that the women are doing that thing they do to get attention from the men and the men are loud and boisterous. Everyone is younger than me. Janet goes up to order food. It’s a Latino food truck with all these sauces and a version of falafel which I understand is not Mexican food or anything. She’s grabbing her meal and Maria shows up again. It’s interesting, when Maria shows up, everyone gets quiet. She starts talking and giving directions and instructions and they listen to her. There’s also a leader of this group somewhere who’s teaching or telling everyone what to do. All of a sudden I get a feeling that things are getting covert because whatever this leader is saying is on the downlow, so everyone is hush hush, but there are action steps everyone will take to try and correct some sort of wrong that is happening. I’m not clear on what it is. I just get a sense that some of this stuff is hush hush and the boisterous boys are part of the act. So my friend Janet goes to get her meal and sits down with some other women. Maria starts yelling at her. This whole time I was trying to engage Maria in conversation or engage the other people in conversation and I’m not getting a lot of back and forth. So I notice that Maria starts yelling at Janet and she’s sharp. She feels pretty sinister at this point and I’m like, “Oh wow, I don’t know who that is actually.” I leave that table and go to a hallway that’s like a hallway to some bathrooms. I’m in the hallway and talking with one of the guys. At some point I see Maria again. She either follows me in or I come out of this hallway and she’s there. She just keeps trying to avoid me, which is funny because at this point I’m not seeking her out; I’m just minding my own business because she’s made it really clear that she doesn’t want to talk to me and I’ve seen that she’s not the person I thought. That black hat she was wearing earlier, she’s still wearing but it’s tilted so that you can only see part of her face - classic villain-esse style. I leave this food truck area because I’m hungry and I can’t eat what’s at the food truck. I go down the street a little bit and there’s a restaurant with Viking food - that’s how it’s advertised. So I go inside and read the menu. They have paleo donuts and I’m sold. I’m flipping through the rest of the menu and it’s Chinese and Thai food and all this international cuisine that is definitely not Viking food. My friend Janet shows up at the restaurant and says, “Oh, I will eat here with you.” She ends up not being able to eat her meal at the food truck because Maria ate part of it and then threw the rest of it in her face. She sees the paleo donuts and is like, “Yep, I’m down.” We go to sit down and order more food. I’m flipping through the menu and seeing Asian food and stuff. I look up and the inside of the restaurant has really tall ceilings and really tall windows that look out towards the street where there are passersby. There’s a counter in the back, but it’s open so you can see the cooks working in the kitchen. I can see two chefs standing at the front counter. There’s a glass case and I don’t know if there’s food or what in it. They’re standing waiting for our order. I know I ordered the little paleo donut thing. I think Janet tries to order something, but Maria shows up again and drags her out of the restaurant.",Rose,last_nights_dream

It’s a two-story house and I’m really uncertain whether or not we all live together in the safe house or if my son and I are staying in my daughter’s house for the purpose of taking care of her pets. We’re on the main floor of the house when the dream starts. We are looking after her cats and some other strange mix of mammal - I’m not really sure what it is. It has skin that is slightly furry but not a lot of fur, maybe like a horse. It’s small, a little smaller than a cat. It has a long neck and very appealing eyes. We’re going about our daily activities. I’m mucking about in the garden and Daniel is doing his own thing. We feed the mammal-like creatures in the morning and then again at suppertime. We do this for a whole 24-hour day. When I go down to the basement to get something, I see two other tanks there. One of them is a water tank and it’s filled with water creatures. The other one has reptiles in it. I’m horrified because the one with the reptiles is a really large, large, large cage and the reptiles are at the bottom but there’s a tiny very angry chimpanzee about the size of my hand rattling the sides of the cage and screaming because it’s so hungry. I yell up to my son, “Why didn’t you tell me she’s got two more down here?!” He says he’s sorry and he forgot. I’m like, “Oh my god the snakes are all upset!” And there’s a cobra, a black cobra with gold markings on its skin and it’s half-sitting up with its hood fanned out. All the animals are agitated. The water tank with the fish like ones have their teeth bared and I’m afraid they’re going to eat each other. I’m just really horrified and upset that the animals are suffering because we did not feed them. I tell my son to go get the food for the reptiles and the tiny chimpanzee. I’m looking around for the food for the water tank. So I put the food in the tank and am watching the fish eat it. I notice the water level has dropped down at least a food. I think I’d better put more water in it. I get a pitcher and fill it with warm water. I’m checking the temperature with my fingers to make sure it’s body temperature. I add two pitchers in and now the water is about six inches from the top and I think that’s good. Then I go to check on the other tank and they seem okay. I’m just watching their behavior for a few minutes. Then I turn around and the fish tank is full to the top with water! How did this happen? It can’t be this full because the fish and other creatures will swim overtop of it and out onto the floor and they’ll die. So I take up the pitcher and I’m slowly trying to submerge the pitcher a little bit so that only the water goes into the pitcher without also pulling some of the creatures or living plants with it. But one is in there! I’m not sure if it’s an aquatic animal or plant. So I try to keep the water in the pitcher and just pour out the creature. I manage to do this and then I pour the excess water into the laundry tub. I go back to the fish tank. My son has poured some hot water in and again I’m really upset. I feel it with my finger and take some of the water out then add some cold water in and it feels normal again. I’m looking at them to see if they’re all still living. I’m just in such a state of agitation because I know this is terrible for them. As I’m dumping out one more jug of just water to equalize the temperature, I look and all the water is gone! I’m like, “Oh my god, how could you do this?! Go get a jug!” I’m putting body temperature water into my son’s jug and tell him to quickly go put it in the tank. I ask him how long it’s been like this. Then I take another jug in. I’m wondering if that’s enough to keep them breathing until we manage to fill the rest of the tank up. We are frantically doing this. I notice the tank with the reptiles and the small chimpanzee is getting even more and more agitated. I wonder what else is going on where they are or if they’re agitated because the creatures in the water tank might be dying. I’m wondering if I should let them all go and maybe they’ll live. The feeling is quickly mixed in with the fact that my daughter trusted us and I need to soothe this so that they’re alive when she gets here and allow her to make that decision. I’m also looking at the expression on the small chimpanzee’s face. This small chimpanzee is capable of communicating to me what is really happening in the animal world in both tanks.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

Julie is playing something that sounds like a guitar but it has no body, just a neck which looks like a broom handle with a string that goes from one end to the other and acts like a guitar strap so you can put it around the back of your neck. She’s playing a non-existent fretboard. Her hands go up and down the broom handle making guitar-like sounds. When Alice brings hers out I comment that I didn’t realize she could play the guitar. She says she’s been playing for some time. It’s a sunny day - the skies are blue, it’s pleasant and balmy. The waters are a bit choppy but it’s not alarming in any sense, so everybody is kind of relaxed. The woman with the dark hair in a bun says we’ll be arriving in a couple of hours so just continue what we’re doing which is playing songs. Alice is leading the song. She plays the first fret, second fret, then up to fourth fret in bar chords. I get my guitar out and using the same fretboard pattern I begin to pick out a melody. At one point she stops me, corrects me and tells me that she’s playing a finger pattern with E Major with the first index finger barring the strings on the first, second and fourth fret. I tell her that’s exactly what I was doing. She sits back down. We eventually get close to the island. The woman with the dark hair bun tells us we’ll be there in a few minutes, so we all start stowing away what we’ve got out and putting it into our packs so we’re organized. We pull up to a dock and tie up. Everybody gets out, walks up the dock, up a path and into a small cottage. Inside the cottage, we put various things away. People eat. There is some discussion and conversation during the making of food, but it’s not a community meal because we’ve each brought our own things. So basically we’re just cooking it up then eating. There is some kind of event that we’ve come for. When it’s announced, because it’s all couples I say I’m going to stay behind. The woman says, “Are you sure? There will be dancing after.” I say, “No, I’m not doing this couples thing by myself.” So I’ve elected to stay behind. However, after the meal, we walk back to the boat and I’m needed to help cast off. So I do this. Then I linger for a little while on the dock while the others sail off on the small barge. I stay there and am relaxing, feeling my breath and lying on my back looking up at the sky, feeling the gentle movement of the water. I don’t know how long I stay there, but it’s still daylight when I decide to go back to the small cottage. When I arrive there I see my friend Keith has also stayed back and he’s putting some things into his pockets. He has something the size and shape of an aerosol can. He takes that in one hand and takes the lid from a deep pocket in his pants and places it on. Then he’s taking something else out of his back pocket that I realize is a used condom and I think, “Hmm, I wonder what he’s been doing...or it’s obvious what he’s been doing while we were gone.” He’s about to dispose of these items in the garbage when the woman with dark hair comes back in and he hurriedly tucks them back in his pocket. He doesn’t want her to see. She tells us that if we want to find out what happened ten years ago, we’d better hurry but we’re not to let on we’re looking for this or the people that live here will not share information. So we exit out the cottage following her deeper into the island. We’re in a gathering place in a village. There are people, but when I look at them, I sense that they’ve lived there for generations and are not used to strangers because they’re staring at us oddly. It’s not an entirely welcoming stare as I interpret hostility. We are looking for some indication that a cataclysmic event happened ten years ago. So we are looking for disruptions in the smooth running of events or maybe that the town hall is missing some dates of town hall meetings from ten years ago. In fact, we find this evidence on the front of the town hall, itself! There’s a pole in front of the town hall building that has dates etched into it and there is a disruption. That’s when I see that the name of the island is Avalon. There’s a period of time where there are no dates and it is in fact ten years ago. I try not to react or look at my companions as though I’ve noticed something. We continue to wander around the village looking for such evidence as to corroborate this. The sky begins to be less bright. I look up and notice the sun is beginning to set. I realize we must make our way back to the cottage we’re staying in. Without verbalizing this to my companions, we just begin to retrace our steps back to the path to the cottage. By the time we get to the cottage, it’s twilight. We go in. we’re having a discussion - the dark haired lady, Keith and me - about what we’ve found. We each found different things to confirm that something tragic happened there ten years ago. The people who live there either don’t remember and have some kind of amnesia or they do remember, but are refusing to talk about it and don’t want anyone else to know. While we’re having this discussion, the rest of the group that went to the event come back in and they are not there to track what we’re tracking. At this point, my recall is not sharp. There’s no sleeping or staying overnight in the cottage. We simply leave the next day and it’s daylight. The other friends that attended the event are oblivious of what we’ve done and we’re simply back in the little barge with the same guitars singing the same songs and heading away from the island as though the island didn’t even really exist and we never even stopped there.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

In the entrance way I was greeted by name by a friendly nurse who I had met before. We spoke for a moment, then a patient walked in and had to be checked for signs of covid. I was sitting down in a chair and moved as far to the left as possible so that we would remain socially distanced.  A minute later our conversation ended and I approached the front desk to request the medicine.

I was in an accountability session with one of the new guys who was confessing to being a sex addict. One of his friends told about the time he was playing a sexual video game and was abused by 13 other players in game chat. He definitely confessed too openly. At the end of small group I was letting new Charlie know that we met every week at 630pm on Tuesday nights. He was confused by what I said and kept coming to the wrong conclusion. Eventually I got through to him and told him I would have the group leader text him with the details.  I then was lying on a bed and was tired. I didn't particularly care that everyone else thought it was odd. Ronald from STU made a joke about it as I was getting up. On the bed lay a marble sized soccer ball which I picked up and threw as hard as I could at Ronald. I nailed him and it hit him so hard that it bounced off of the wall and hit him again.

I was still on my keto diet and I was having some difficulty finding anything which I could eat. It was dark in the house but eventually I found some biscuits and was then looking for honey to put on them.  I was tired that morning and worried that I would be in a bad mood and would not be good company for our relatives.   Later that day, we looked outside and saw that a storm was approaching. Uncle P. was worried that it would be a terrible one and that we all needed to take shelter. We weren't as convinced. Stepping outside we could see that we were in the middle of a large grassy field with woods to one side and a train track going through them a train was stopped on the tracks and I could see a white oil car and box car.  Looking up at the sky we could see the sky darkening. The house blocked our view of the darkest part of the storm so we couldn't tell exactly how bad it would be. Then I noticed that a yellow school bus had parked itself at the edge of the field. It looked as if they were taking shelter from the storm. All of a sudden the school bus was close to us. My mom and I debated sending someone over to offer our assistance but with the storm approaching it was dangerous. We looked at the school bus again and it was now a faded yellow. This indicated to us that they didn't want our help. But then it became bright again.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

Before it was a lot more spacious with only two big beds in each of the rooms. Now there are five smaller beds in one room and women are getting settled in their beds. I go in with my son and we say hello. He climbs up on the different beds. I recognize one person as a patient of mine in waking life. We go into a room we’ve stayed in before. Instead of two beds, this room now has four. I look for mine. I see my friend Dee. People are talking about the pluses and minuses of this new situation. It’s less expensive at least. We go downstairs to a packing and shipping operation. We are being forced into this labor. It’s a Facebook meets Amazon thing. The man is showing us what we need to do. A crane is lifting a huge heavy box filled with rubber masks. It brings it to a truck to be shipped. Now we are all made to sit at our stations and are then given a box of cardboard envelopes. We are supposed to open the box and remove the ten envelopes. I open an envelope, stuff it with a rubber mask and a flyer with the image of an American flag, then lick the flap, seal it closed and put it in another box. We are all doing this. I’m nearly done with my box when I get to an envelope that is deformed. The flap is difficult to open - it’s wrinkled and torn. Once I put the mask in the envelope, I have a really hard time closing it and sealing it. I’m concerned that they’ll come by and look at my work and my work will be unacceptable. I have a sense of my grandmother’s presence for a bit, but then she moves on. They do come by and give me this look and make a note on their clipboard, so now I’m being watched more carefully. Then we are ushered over to a grassy hill, like an outdoor amphitheater. I see Dee again. I also see John Friend sitting on the grass with a couple young women on either side. The women have these sour judgmental looks on their faces. I find it curious that he’s here in the audience. This is a teaching conference and it seems he’s there to cause disruption and discontent and questioning of the new authority. Somehow because of his presence and the women on his sides, there is less order. The teaching does not come through or land because people are not paying attention to the teaching, but looking at him, wondering why he’s there and what he’s going to do.",Ana,last_nights_dream

It looks like a cross between a Master Healer and an ex buddhis monk who I learned meditation from - he left the monastery because he preferred joy. I’m on the treatment table and facing him. He’s wearing a light blue robe or shirt. He starts to move his hands like an air bender. I start to fall asleep like the REM healing sleep and there are images coming to mind. I tell myself to remember these images so i can remember them later. Then I go into the deep healing sleep. He’s still doing the airbender motion in front of my body. I’m lying on my right side the whole time, almost in the fetal position. He’s working at chest level - heart and solar plexus energy centers. I have a sense that I’m asleep for a while. As I come out, my brain kicks in again and tells me to remember the healing images. As I wake up, the healer says: “Tend to your masculine energy child. Look up Libra moon. That’s what you need for healing.” I did a deep healing breath as he finished his hand motions - in both my sleep in my dream and my sleep in real life. I woke up in that position - lying on my right side. I had a sense he was removing an energetic entanglement.",Rose,last_nights_dream
1234,1436,,30/08/2020,08/30/2020 00:03,"“The Shopping Mall” I’m in a large urban city. It’s quite colorless. The skyscrapers are tightly packed together and they cut up all sense of time and natural light. I feel like I can’t identify where I am because of it. I’m in the top floor of a mid-city urban shopping mall and most of it is sub-sea level, so the sidewalks and everything are built underneath the ground. I go in the great big main doors. There are ten doors. I’ve had to climb up about eight steps to do this. It’s cement and the doors are simply glass. I walk in the front of the mall and stand there feeling both overwhelmed by the sheer number of stores and floors as well as a little bit of anxiety about whatever it is that I need enough that I have ventured in here. There is also a sense that I have a time limit. So I start to walk towards the foyer. I’m looking for one of those big information signs that has the arrow that says “you are here” and lists the index of all the stores, but I don’t see one. Because I’m still looking, I’m getting further and further into the mall. I notice that three quarters of the stores aren’t even open. The ones that are, are more of a generic type of palette - the way a Dollar Store would have an eclectic variety of carts and things with brightly colored things crammed into every nook and cranny of the store, but not in an enticing way, but in a fluorescent this really hurts my eyes kind of way. I start to look and get really close to the windows and the glass doors of the ones that are not open. I look and see what they’re offering. They’re all specialty shops. Each store that’s just dedicated to clothing has clothing of a certain style. I note with some interest that I have an appreciation for some of these styles as the fabric looks durable yet light, the styles allow for some free flowing movement of the body. I note that they probably would be slightly waterproof in the way rain would roll off the top. But they’re not made of raincoat material or anything; they’re like a cotton I guess. Then I start to notice that the way they’ve used the space is wasteful. They have not used the back wall of the store nor one of the sides, but only one wall. So there’s very little inventory offered in each. I think, “Wow, how decadent, yet how wasteful.” Then I figure that whatever it is that they’re offering is really really expensive and therefore only available to a few people. I feel disappointed that the kind of quality I was noticing and the creativity and practicality of the styles is now only for those who are rich enough to afford it. I stop being curious to see what’s in the windows and note in a general way, “Oh this clothing store is also only using one wall, I’m not even going to look at it.”",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

M. was there directing lights and sound. I did something which ended up turning off some lights in the main auditorium but it wasn't a big deal because they had already been having issues P. M. was trying to fix. He showed me the device for controlling sound, and then a small white circular device with pins that could be pushed up and down and then locked into place. Each pin represented a light in the church. I played around with the device and found it to be finicky. We figured out that if you pushed the pins down halfway and locked them that it was more stable.   I sat down to watch the service and P. M. moved behind me and began brushing my hair. When he had finished I could tell that he had done something strange to my hair. I thought it might be a ponytail, but alas it was four pigtails.

I walked over to a second helicopter and this time did not duck.  They were offering rides where one would put on a harness and be dragged behind the helicopter trusting the pilot to not let you get tangled in the blades. The contraption had wheels so that you could make a safe landing. I considered going for it and think I would have, but first I watched someone else. The chopper took off and he went soaring. As the chopper banked hard to the right he was thrown off to the left. The chopper made a circle and touched down again. The guy behind slammed into the ground but made tha landing without any issue.

We were just making it to the end of our journey and were about to head back. It was evening and we traveled along a small road through hills and into a forest.   It immediately grew dark as we were now on the opposite side of the ridge from where the sun was setting. We turned around and began to return the way we came. We were talking and as we rode, we were joined by a girl on a moped or bicycle. When we joined up with her, we noticed that it became light again, which was odd because though we had crosses back to the light side if the ridge, it was now too light to explain by ordinary means.  We continued and at the bottom of a steep hill we realized that our bike and moped were back at the top and were going to pick up speed as they went down. We got them and I jumped back on and rode along with the girl. We were going fast now, full throttle, and the scenery was beautiful and lit by the tired glow from the setting sun. I discussed with the girl my plans to hike the trail but only walking for 3 tok 5 hours a day so that I would have time to write. To our right were clouds and one giant round cumulus cloud was shaped into a perfect face. I stopped the party and pointed it out. I was worried that it was only I who saw the face, but the girl exclaimed that it was indeed a perfect face. The face dissolved until all that was left was a single eye staring at us.

I’m having a hard time finding a wall to put it against or just a spot to have it. It needs a plug and I can’t find a plug. I’m brainstorming and talking out loud with myself and with her to try and get this piano put someplace. But it’s her house, so I have this feeling of reservation because I need to get her permission. It feels a bit awkward because I don’t think she needs the piano. She’s also my boss and I’m fucking around with this piano thing, but there is work I need to be doing, so that feels a bit odd. It’s also quarantine time like now, but more apocalyptic feeling. My attention moves on from the piano and the headlines are pretty dire with deaths and whatnot. I’m also reading the astrology and getting the astrology report - it was basically telling me to buckle up because there’s more tension and destruction coming. We’ve already had a lot, but there’s more based on the planetary alignments. For whatever reason, it’s time for me to leave the house. I head out and am walking down the side of the road. I don’t know if I have my mask on or if I’m carrying it with me. The skies are dark and ominous. There are cars going by and I’m trying to avoid them. It’s strange, it’s like I’m trying to avoid people all together. The road is paved, but either side of the road are grassy fields without a lot of buildings or anything. In the distance I can see a stand of trees, way far down the way. All of a sudden there's a group of younger people also on the side of the road. I’m trying to keep distance from them for whatever reason - I don’t know if it’s quarantine rules or what. I can hear what is going on. They’re all talking and being talked to by a scout leader or something. The scout leader is trying to prepare them for stuff. I’m trying to mind my own business and read the astrology and whatnot. They are teenagers, 16-18 years old. The scout leader is warning them: “Hey, pay attention. There are people out there who will kidnap you! We’re kind of living in this no-man’s land type of place with no rules. There are definitely people out to get you.” It sounded a lot like conspiracy theory stuff, but he was basically trying to warn these kids about a cartel of people who were kidnapping kids and doing trafficking but also trying to give them coronavirus. I was nodding my head with him and saying, “Yeah, watch out. This stuff is real. There are people out there who don’t have your best interest at heart and are running the world and have let this virus come out. You’ve gotta be careful because not everything is as it seems.” At this point cars are going by and I see old white people who look like they are on their way to church going by in their cars. Then, somehow the scene changes and I’m in a train station. It’s like all of a sudden I’m trying to get away from people. I see that some of these kids are on a train.

It’s like an aluminum rowboat with a tiller to steer the motor from - it’s probably just a really long handle that extends from the motor. I’m in there with two other people - one that is unidentified and the other is Ellen. We’re navigating through the water heading somewhere. We navigate once where the waters are regular, not rough, and it’s still nighttime. Basically, we’re just motoring straight forward for an hour, then we have to arc around some small clumps of land. We arc around to the left and motor for another little while. In the dream, we’re supposed to get off but what happens is when we complete that, we start again, only this time instead of Ellen at the motor, I’m at the motor. When I’m at the motor, the water is super shallow and it’s tricky to navigate through. I’m worried that we’re going to scrape the bottom and we’ll be stuck. It really looks that way especially when we arc around to the left - I can actually see that the water i smud instead of water on land. Despite this, after we arc around to the left, the boat keeps going but a bit more slowly. I can feel the anxiety and tension in my grip on the motor and in the muscles in my body. We make it. The boat stops and all three of us get out. We walk up a dock and into a cottage that’s very dark and damp. All three of us are exhausted. We go to our assigned rooms. Mine is nearer to the living room. When we walk in, it opens up into a living room and again off to the left is a hallway with bedrooms. My bedroom is the one closest to the living room. The bedrooms are very simple. Everything is very rudimentary here - all that’s in there is a single bed and a small nightstand. It’s kind of dingy and actually doesn’t feel very clean to me. The bedspread and sheets feel really thin and worn. However, I’m just exhausted so I lie down on the bed, close my eyes and sleep. I feel like I haven’t slept very long when I am awakened by the sound of voices through the wall in the living room next to me. I get up. Ellen is already awake and she’s reading off of a sheet of paper. Other people are sitting around listening. One of those people is my friend Ken. they sound like they are rehearsing for something. We’ve been divided into groups. I'm in a group with Ken and other people I cannot identify and they don’t really play a role in my dream. We have to practice something that we are to act out later for the group. Ken has been preparing for this while I was sleeping. He’s been reading out of a book called, Todos Los Manana. We have to exercise for this and get stronger. We go into the next room that looks exactly the same as the basement in the house I grew up in - the one with a playroom, a door and a laundry room. At the top of the door, which is actually just a doorway without a door, is a bar. I’m to do chin-ups on this bar. I have a hard time doing the chin-ups because my arms aren’t strong enough. I practice some abdominal exercises there by bending at the hips and bringing my legs toward my torso. I used to be able to do ten of these, but I can only do three on that particular day. I jump down from the bar and am doing some squats and then I do some pushups. Meanwhile I see that Ken has progressed a lot further through the book. I notice that he has gained some weight, but it looks very muscular and I recall that he has been doing some home renovations, so he has a bit of a jump start on this. While Ken and I are continuing to try and build up our body strength enough, I look over and the people in Ellen’s group in the living room are already well onto their lines. Ken and I are not this far through the book. Something indicates that our time is up. We are called to regroup back into the living room. So both of us go back. At this point, I look at the cover of the book again and decide that really what I need to do is read it. So I open it up and start to read. Suddenly, I’m immersed into a swimming pool - the kind in a hotel. I’m doing laps in the pool. When I pause to stop for breath, the person in the pool next to me is Michael Jackson, only he’s really really young, maybe 19 or 20. He really is the feminine energy. We swim for a little more, maybe another ten laps. I’m feeling happy with how well my body is moving through the water. We stop swimming and get out. We’re sitting on the edge of the pool and I’m thinking I want a towel to dry myself off with. I see one of those luggage carts that bellboys use. It’s been wheeled up beside the pool and is half full with towels. I see my two swim towels in it; the rest of the towels are white from the hotel. I wonder, because they’re all just kind of thrown there if they’re right out of the dryer and not been folded or if they’re actually dirty towels. I don’t want to use someone else’s dirty towel, so I weed through and pick out my two swim towels. Michael chooses two randomly. We dry off and it’s time to get changed. He says that everything I need I can get from where he is staying because now I’m in this hotel and not in the cottage where I was originally and my suitcase is back in that other place. So he invites me to come and choose from his clothes and I agree. We are dressed in towels. We were swimming naked. We leave the hotel. I’m feeling vulnerable because we have to walk through the city and I have no clothes on underneath the towels. I didn’t really wrap the towels around me properly, I just did it haphazardly, so I’m trying to snug them up so the towels stay secure on my body. We cross the busy city street, not at a stoplight, but just by running where there were no cars. Then we go through an alleyway. There are some sketchy looking people in the alleyway, so I’m somewhat nervous here because I’m not dressed properly and I only have a towel. We make it through to the end of the alleyway. Now we're in another urban hotel. We walk into the lobby and go right up to his room. He has all kinds of agents and publicity people there who I don’t know and am uncomfortable with. They ignore us. We go to where his clothing is kept. We’re sorting through it. I tell him it needs to be clothing I can move freely in because we’re going to be doing a lot of physical things with our bodies. I want to be able to bend at the hips. I need to be able to put one hand on the ground and kick the other leg up into some kind of standing half moon posture, etc. He says, “I know, I have the perfect thing for you.” He opens a drawer and takes out something with colorful pockets. It comes up like a pair of pants to the waist. Most of the fabric is soft grey like a thin sweatshirt material. There is a zipper up the back and it has a bib kind of like a clown suit; the bib part is a halter top. It’s bare-backed, grey background with colorful pockets. I think that would actually be perfect. Maybe I just need a tank top to go underneath. It looks a bit small and I’m worried it won't fit over my hips, but I try it on. It’s a little snug but not really and I can still move in it. I’m surprised I fit into it. So I get dressed and thank him for the clothes and go back downstairs. He doesn’t join me. I go through the alleyway, through the pool area, and am suddenly back in the living room of where I’m supposed to be.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

We got to a shore where the water was cleaner and more like a lake. We walked up the beach to a cave which we entered. Inside were two devices. A device to create poison gas and another to blow it. The gas was released on a timer and it just started to fill the cave. William was almost unconscious when he grabbed the blower and managed to stave off the gas. He collapsed and the next round was up to me. I ran with the blower so that I would be far enough away to not be overcome by the poison. Then I realized I could destroy the gas maker or submerge it in the lake. I stopped it but when I did, two aliens approached my brother in the cave. I threw pebbles from the beach at the device in the cave in the hope that I could stop the poison which acted like clean air to the aliens. It didn't work and I returned to my brother. I may have thrown rocks at the aliens but they kept advancing. I approached and tried to apologize but it was no use, they wanted to make us slaves.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

I was in love with Mateo but he was sort of small and so it wasn’t a good match because I was kind of fat. So instead she set me up with his older brother who was bigger. We had nothing in common and didn’t get along and so I pursued Mateo instead and he loved me too. We went to the beach with his family and my girls and we swam.

When I look out the windows, I see some view are industrial buildings with red and green metal roofs. Some views look over the industry to the ocean and sky - these are the views that people want the most. I’m not sure which apartment we are looking at it, but it seems it will be a mixed view, so if we look up and over, we’ll see the ocean and sky rather than the buildings. There is child care here in the building with my mom sometimes. That’s good. We go down the stairs and meet up with a woman who is taking us on a tour of the grounds. She shows us a cute cottage that I’d love to live in. But the front porch is a small restaurant with two settings. There’s a sign about reservations required. It’s charming for people who eat there, but odd for the people who live there because their front porch is a restaurant. Nextdoor is a large building with two doors. Someone is sitting at a table by the door recording names and taking payments. It’s a big ecstatic barefoot dance party and movement class. I’m with my son. We peer in and see Gail standing in the middle not dancing while others are dancing all around. I want to join, but don’t want to pay because there’s only fifteen minutes left. I’m hoping that as I wait, the person sitting at the door will tell me to just go on in, but she doesn’t. So, I leave with my son. Then, we’re in the building in a lounge area a few floors up. We are making plans to feed everybody for a wedding feast. The two extended families that come together are not in harmony. There has been at least one divorce. People are meandering around, sitting in tight little knots and not mixing with each other. The patriarch whispers that he has brought meat from the Prussian Costco and will barbecue it for dinner tonight. It’s supposed to be a very special meat. He whispers it with a certain sense of self-importance because he has brought it all the way from Prussia and has been storing it in the freezer for this occasion. Swamiji is sitting on the couch listening to it all. I’m sitting next to him. My son is bouncing around on our laps. I stand up and go look out the window next to the fireplace, then come back. Swamiji has scooched over a bit so there’s no place for me to sit. I’m watching my son to see if he’s okay. I stand there sipping a drink (some clear alcohol with ice) and observing the whole scene.",Ana,last_nights_dream
1251,1438,,01/09/2020,09/01/2020 00:03,"“The Pool” I’m in a building that is several stories high. I never go outside of the building. I can just sense that I'm that far off the ground. There’s a lot of light coming in through windows in the ceiling; there aren’t any windows on the sides. Sometimes the light is so bright it hurts my eyes. At other times it’s just a presence. There are two pools in the building and they’re separated by a wall. They aren’t artificial pools. They look like natural pools insofar as if no one is in the water, the organic material will settle down to the bottom and you’ll be able to see it through the water. One of the pools is more often this way. The other one is muddy and the water does not look appealing to swim in at all. There is an army of guards surrounding both pools. They are vicious, mean, and I feel like they are alien as well. They are heartless, robotic. They’re in charge of us. They make judgments against us. Then they force us into the pools where depending on how we react, determines whether we will live or die. I see Debra and Omar. Both Debra and I are concerned about Omar as he seems to be getting the brunt of much maltreatment by these robotic guards. They’re pushing him around and poking him with things and they’re telling him he has this long list of wrongdoings. He’s going to be forced into the pool and killed. In fact, we know he is going to die this particular day. He has prepared for it in some way. Now there’s a little antechamber off the pools. We are sitting there talking to him. He’s telling us of his regrets. He’s also saying he’s in full knowledge of these and he’s voluntarily allowing them to treat him this way. He’s also explaining to us that going into the pool is part of the process and going voluntarily will make it better for him. So, this eases some of our tension and anxiety and sadness. Then it’s time for us all to leave the antechamber so we do. We go back out to the area around the pools. I notice that Omar has got metal boots - they look like the kind of boots that Roman soldiers would have worn. Now he’s also wearing the metal armor that they would have worn as well. Yet, he’s going to jump into the crystalline pool and I’m thinking that’s a really bad idea because it’s going to make him heavy; he’ll sink down to the bottom and then disturb all the dirt and organic material and it will turn into mud, and then they will judge him harshly. He does it anyway. I can feel the robotic guards start to surround us. One of them pushes me with their bayonet. I am forced into the pool as well. I’m trying not to move because I don’t want to stir up any of the silt from the bottom. Actually both of us do a really good job at keeping the pool water crystal clear. I swim to the end where it’s deeper. I find an opening where the people are not being treated as harshly and I get out and join them. Omar, however, is still in the pool. I'm not sure if he is going to be able to find an opening to get out. The guards are still really thick there and there doesn’t seem to be any escaping. The person beside me when I’m getting out says she’s been there for a really long time. Her hands are behind her back. They look like they’re tied, but I don’t think they are - I think she’s just standing like that. It makes it look as though we’re captives but really we’re starting to move more freely. So I do the same thing. I put my wrists together at the back of my body. I’m moving with the crowd. I’m slipping into the opening between the pools and I walk around the outside, allowing myself to be jostled by the people being pushed. But I’m actually not being pushed. I’m moving in and around the crowd. The constant moving is avoiding us being pushed to our deaths. This carries on for quite some time. I’m still looking to see if Omar is alive in the pool and he is. I can feel his life force starting to slip away and change into something else. I’m not hopeful that I will see him again alive and outside of the pool.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

1255,1225,,02/09/2020,09/02/2020 00:03,"I’m at a huge event in a huge stadium. I don’t think it’s a sporting event, though. All kinds of people are there - all races, all colors, all genders and non-genders - the whole human family. I’m not sure what we’re watching or participating in - not sure if it’s a show or convention or speeches or sporting event. But something is happening down in the center of the arena. I’m sitting way back and at the top. I’m not sitting by anyone I know - there isn’t anyone I know in this dream. To my left is a bunch of white young women laughing and being obnoxious. To my right two rows down is a black family - I see a woman and a man. I fall asleep at some point. I wake up suddenly because there is a lot of noise and it has gotten loud in my section. I startle awake. I’m trying to figure out what's going on. The black woman two rows in front of me is talking about the white women that had been over to my left. Apparently they said something totally racist and obnoxious, but I missed it because I had been asleep. She’s talking to the other white people in the crowd: “When are y’all going to say something?!” She’s mad; she’s pissed. I’m trying to catch up on what’s happened and hear what she’s saying, but my brain is foggy and muggy. I missed the whole event and my window to say something to those other white women who were being rude. All I can feel is the pain of all the balck people around me of being treated as not human. It’s making me mad. I’m really upset and I’m also really conscious that my anger and sadness for them is not really appropriate to express because I fell asleep and I don’t know what’s really going on, and I’m white and they see me as the enemy. This is making me want to cry to know that my empathy and compassion would be rejected. I also feel anger at the white women that seemed so ignorant and uncaring in their ways. There’s a shift in the dream. Now this event suddenly makes sense. This is a showcase of cultures. There was black culture in the hundred million thousand ways they have. Then it’s Hawaii’s turn to showcase what they know. I’ve now moved positions in this huge arena and I’m a lot further down and a lot closer to the stage. I’m with the Hawaiian contingency because I’m from there, but I’m not Hawaiian, so I’m not really doing anything. There are rows that I’m not allowed to sit in because I’m not Hawaiian. So I go up a few rows and see all my classmates in a row - some are Hawaiian but most are not. I see Johnny and his wife Amanda. Johnny is white like I am. Amanda is white and Filipino. He’s funding it. He has a big chain around his neck like a king would wear to denote kingship. So he’s in charge. I’m uncomfortable with that because he’s a white guy and this is the Hawaiian contingent. I’m wondering why a Hawaiian isn’t in charge. I’m also crazy jealous because whatever this guy touches is gold and he makes tons of money and he somehow has figured out the secret to being kind and not being an asshole, yet still do business and make money. I’m like, “Wow, I haven’t figured that out.” I know how to be kind, but I don’t know how to make money. This is interesting to feel. So the Hawaii contingent goes down and they do their cultural piece. Some of my friends who are not Hawaiian are somehow allowed to be down on the floor doing their thing. I get the feeling of not being allowed to be in there and that really hurts the not-belonging especially because now it doesn’t seem to be based on skin color. As I’m watching this happen, I’m sitting with Johnny and Amanda and some other friends, and cheering so hard for Hawaii. It’s a beautiful display that the whole world gets to see. Then suddenly it’s time to eat. I’m starving and everybody’s starving. Somebody says, “El Sancho is serving!” I’m like, “Yes! I want to eat food from El Sancho!” Actually I only want to eat pulled pork. Johnny jumps up and goes. I see Amanda go. I’m like, “Oh my god, am I invited? Do I get to eat?” I’m not invited but I’m hungry. Then the dream shifts again. I remember being in this barren desert place. I can see mountains in the distance and dead trees. I’m not alone. I can't tell who I’m with; it’s a female body or entity who also seems lost. Maybe I’m trying to get us someplace. She’s just wandering. I don’t think she’s a human - the energy doesn’t seem human. We’re wandering in circles looking for something because there’s something we need to find. I say, “We need to follow the sun.” We face the sun. The sun is orange like the moon is sometimes as it rises from smoke and fire. The sun is rising or setting - I can’t tell - behind this huge mountain range. We’re heading in that direction. As we’re walking through the sand, there are all these glass bookshelves, some toppled in the sand and some standing up. I look into one and there are two books on one of the shelves. I think one is a dictionary or computer programming. The book next to it seems to be literature. I’m looking at these two books on this glass shelf. I can feel the warmth of the sunlight and it has an orange tinge. It seems like we're heading in the direction now that we’re heading towards the mountains, but I’m still not sure what we’re supposed to be doing, or where we’re going, or why we’re in the desert in the first place.",Rose,last_nights_dream
1256,1439,,02/09/2020,09/02/2020 00:04,"“Adventures” I take a taxi to my lover’s apartment. I arrive and he’s doing a load of laundry. He has a washing machine and dryer in his kitchen. I’m interested in the vibration that the washing machine on spin cycle is making. He says that he wants to go out and get a coffee, so I agree. Strangely, I’m dressed in something that looks like silk pajamas, Japanese style, with a really beautiful kimono overtop. He’s also wearing something similar. I’m thinking, “Well these don’t really look like pajamas, so it’s okay to go out in them.” So we call a taxi and go down to the lobby to wait for it. We both climb in the taxi. He’s in the front seat, passenger side. I’m in the back seat. I sit forward and lean onto the front seat with my forearms. He asks me if I’ve ever been to the town stadium. I’m confused because we don't have anything in this town called the Town Stadium, though we have many other stadiums of different names. I question him and say, “Do you mean the Place or the Colosseum?” At the same time as he’s answering me, the taxi cab driver starts talking and is describing the stadium as a band, like someone that plays live concerts and sings songs. He’s talking overtop Franco. I notice that it is my ex-husband. I ask him to be quiet so I can hear what Antono is saying. Then I repeat the question because I’m still curious and trying to figure out what place he means. By this time we’re already at the place he wants to get coffee. The cab pulls up. It’s right on the corner of a street. Both buildings on the corner are made of this beautiful terracotta brick which my town is known for. The corner where the two buildings come together has been removed and it’s glassed in and there’s just enough room for someone to sit behind the counter. The guy sitting there behind the counter has all these barista tools and equipment in front of him. But it’s so small you can't even really stand in there. So the cab doors open. Franco opens the door to the coffee shop. He steps out of the cab, leans into the store because there’s only enough room for that, and tells the barista what he wants. He sits back down in the passenger seat while he waits and then the guy hands him a coffee. I notice that I’ve seen that barista somewhere before. He used to own another store. He’s got shoulder length medium brown hair and is about 35. I’m trying to think where I’ve seen him. I’m thinking he’s left his other business and is succeeding in this tiny little spot. I’m thinking he’s made this interesting little corner store himself. We get back in the cab and start driving. He’s sipping his coffee. We come to this street and we get out there instead of at his apartment. We walk down the street and I see this beautiful old farmhouse. The street is like something out of a fairytale. All the trees and bushes and plants look like they’re hundreds of years old. They look like they’re well cared for. The trees radiate caring and beauty and so does everything! You can tell it’s old because the lawns aren’t maincured, but set because they’ve been cared for so long they don’t even require care anymore. They just radiate this lush almost European kind of feel. The architecture of the houses looks like it’s been hand-done, not computerized. Each house is a little different, but they are all late 1800’s style. At the end of this small street, there is the house that is inviting. I can see that if you go in the side door and come out the front, you’re actually on lakefront property. I make a comment to Franco that it looks like this street is ready for Halloween because people have started to tie these orange decorations - but they aren't pumpkins, just the colors. So the idea was to sit by the water and finish the drinks. But, the house looks inviting so we go up the side steps and knock on the door. It’s just a screen door and is not latched. I can’t remember which one of us opens it. We go in the house. I hear an old woman’s voice say, “Hello?” I answer back, “Hello? Hello?” But she doesn’t come to the door. So we walk through into the first room. It’s a kitchen. It’s in marvelous disarray! There are remnants of baking, empty bottles stored under the sink ready to go to the bottle depot, bits of dough and cookie crumbs on the place where you roll out dough, and a little maple table with carved chairs around it. The room is spacious but it’s made just for cooking. There’s a doorway and we go into the next room. There’s a proper sized eating table in it. There’s another oven on the wall and I don’t think about it the first time we walk through; I just note that it’s a ceramic top electric oven - the kind that doesn’t have exposed burners. We walk into the next room and this is a big kitchen. It has cupboards on the walls. It has a sink for washing dishes. This is the room that ahs another side door and when you go down the steps you’re on the waterfront. We’re about to go down the steps when I say, “Just a minute. Let’s walk back through here again. I noticed something.” So we walk back through the three rooms. I say, “Look, this back kitchen is the original kitchen. It has the old wood stove in it. The second room is where people would have sat to eat and there should have only been a table here. The front room is the area for washing up. But, there are three stoves! There’s this original wood, then the electric, then another one in the front room along with the fridge. Isn’t it interesting that it shows the evolution of kitchens and each one has been used. Each one has been lived in. Yet she keeps all stoves when she probably only needs one.” Then we go out the side door that leads to the water. We walk down the steps, over the grass and onto the dock. He threw a coffee cup in the garbage under the sink in the kitchen. So our hands are free. We’re still wearing these silk pajamas and colorful kimonos. I notice the dock is really old and rickety. Some of the wood is crooked and some is actually submersed under water. He notices this too and takes me by the hand and tells me to be careful where I’m walking. He doesn’t want me to fall. I feel something grab my toe and bite it. I lean into him a little more for balance, bend my right knee and turn to look at my right foot. There's this giant crab on it and its body is bigger than my hand! It’s latched onto my big and second toes. With my free right hand I release its jaws and throw it into the water. Just as I’m about to tell him to be careful of the biting things, something else bites him. He’s a little more scared than I. I’m surprised that he’s come on this kind of adventure with me. I notice that he startles and I reach down to flick off whatever is on him - it’s like a pig fetus. It’s about three inches wide and its eyes are closed like the never opened eyes of things in the womb. He sees it and yelps. He’s getting a little scared. It’s clinging to him by an umbilical cord. Then I turn around and I look over the dock into the water and beyond it. So what I’m looking at is underneath the bank in front of the house. You can’t see it if you’re standing in the lawn, but you can see it from the dock. There’s another dock dug in under there. I can see underneath it through the water that there’s a herd of these things. They are elephants with trunks! So what I thought was a pig is an elephant fetus without the trunk. There are about six of these. They’re writhing around in the water and swimming around each other like a school of fish would do. Then there’s this other kind of thing that I see. It’s dark and balck, almost the same color as the black water. It looks more like a snake, but is thicker and shorter. I think, “Oh there’s no way I’m going to swim in that water.” Then I see that there is a girl with the underwater elephant things. She’s clothed and under the water. It looks like she’s either tied to a pole or the pole is running through her body and all these elephant things are slowly pressing the pole forward into what looks like an underwater sea tunnel. I think, “Oh no! We have to save her!” So, I slip into the water and grab her. She’s really really light. I actually grab the pole and pull it toward me. Then Franco brings both of us onto the dock. We are carrying her by the pole into the lady’s house. We go through the kitchens and into this room by the backdoor. There’s a long table and we lie her down on the table. Franco disappears for a moment. I’m wondering if I’m going to have to slide this pole out from her naked body? I see that she’s only been hanging onto the pole and she’s tied to it at a couple of places but if she just lets go, she’s free. She does let go. I pick her up. Her clothes are still on and they're dripping. She’s so light. She weighs almost nothing. I go back through the three kitchens to where Franco is standing and looking out at the water. I say, “Look, she’s going to be okay.” Then we take her out of the house and carry her back to his apartment. We put her in dry clothes and lay her down on one of the beds. I go into his kitchen and make her something warm to drink. I put it in a little tiny bowl and bring it in. He's reading to her when I get back. I’m giving her small sips and supporting her head.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

It feels like a hotel in that there is a large foyer with a front desk and a person who assigns rooms and provides plastic card keys. It feels like an apartment in that people are more permanently ehre and the rooms have a kitchen, sitting room and are decorated according to people’s unique tastes. At first I am in my own room. Then I go to a gathering in another room. I’m meeting with a group of people - some who were in my Gaelic language class - and others also from the town where I live. There’s consternation about the growth of the town. When the meeting is over, people go their separate ways. I’m supposed to teach a private yoga lesson. My client has purchased this for her fiance. I’m trying to find him. There’s an older lady from the meeting who delays me. She carries magic, crone wisdom, and seeing skills. She wants to ask me questions and get a read of me. I want to have this connection with her, yet at the same time I need to keep my appointment - a zoom call. It’s getting really close to the start time of the class. She brings me into the kitchen and asks me questions. I’m uncomfortable with the conversation and hoping I’m giving satisfactory answers. I feel out of place. I am now late for my appointment. I’m trying to be present with her and maintain my obligations and somehow let him know I’m running late because I know he’s waiting. Finally, it’s fifteen minutes past the hour and she nods to release me. I’m trying to get to my room so I can start the lesson. When I get to my room, there are other movement instructors in my room and signing in their classes on my computer. They’ve created excel spreadsheets and downloaded new programs on my computer desktop. I’m trying to close those down but not disturb their process. I’m also annoyed they’ve taken over my computer for their own purposes. I’m also uneasy that so many people are passing through my rooms to get to the studio. After all this messing around, I finally sign in. He’s not there. I see that he has checked in eight different times but has given up. I’m disappointed at letting him down. Time passes. I’m looking at a map of a river and structures being built along the river. Somehow I see people on bicycles riding up and down. I also see fires being started as well. I don’t know if the fires are started by people or nature. We are sending out crews of people to discover what’s happening and put out the fires.",Ana,last_nights_dream
1260,1226,,03/09/2020,09/03/2020 00:02,"I’m with my friends who are part of my council. We’re all gathered. I’m not sure what we’re doing, an adventure of some sort. My one friend who is in the middle of leaving her partnership is with me. She’s the nearest to me. The other friends are more in the background. We are getting on boats in the ocean. I don't know where we’re going. The founder of Astrology Hub which is a service I pay for is also there. I don’t know what she’s doing. I think she’s leading this excursion adventure we’re going on. There’s a big cruise ship that everyone is getting on and then there are some smaller fishing boats that can go quickly and are pretty open but can only sit about five or six people. My friend who’s leaving her partner gets on a fishing boat with me. The captain of the boat is an older man in his fifties or sixties, grey haired, pot bellied, white dude. He’s excited to be driving us “two pretty ladies around” - his words. He is really fawning over my friend. She’s leaning into this free and single thing now. He’s letting her drive the boat but she doesn't let her drive. It’s kind of stormy. The waves are high, the skies are grey, it’s raining. We’re on the boat that doesn’t have a roof, so we’re going to get wet, but everyone on the cruise ship will be fine and dry. There are cameras around and this is being filmed or recorded. I’m watching another friend do a spiel for the cameras, but I can’t hear what she’s saying. There is a hustle and bustle as everyone gets on the boats. So we start to head out into the ocean and the old guy is letting my friend drive. My friend is loving it and saying, “I’m so free!” The wind is blowing in her hair and she’s so excited and so happy. I’m sitting in the back and am like, “Yes, you are totally free right now, but it feels like the pendulum is swinging the other way.” At one point I look over and she’s making out with this old guy who is not her type and kind of gross. She’s like twenty years younger than him. I remember going through this phase and know this is a phase she has to go through - whatever floats your boat girl. We head out into the ocean and I have a sense that the cruise ship is around but I don’t see it and I don’t see the rest of my friends on council, I just know they’re there. We’ve gone from being in a wide open ocean to canals like in Venice. We’re going through these waterways with buildings on either side. I don’t know where we’re going, but my friend is still driving and she’s still making out with this guy. She’s also talking about all her dreams and all the things she’s going to do. She has flowers in her hair and is wearing a shawl. I’m wondering now what happened to the cruise ship and all our other friends. I’m ready to get off the boat because I’m feeling seasick. I don't know if we ever get to our destination or not. But the scene changes and I’m on dry land. I’m with a bunch of other people I know. I can’t tell if we’re at a grocery store where we’re all working or somewhere else and hanging out. It’s a bunch of random men I know - some co-workers, some classmates, some others. It reminds me of a beehive or anthill energy - a bunch of busyness, coming and going, coming and going. People are doing things. We all have our own projects. It dawns on me that every single man is wearing a sweater I knit for them in this dream. Some of the men are my childhood buddies that I grew up with, too. I’m like, “Oh my gosh I knit you that sweater!” The sweaters are all different styles and colors. It’s clear they’ve been worn a lot. The funny thing is that they’re just wearing the sweaters, but not saying, “Hey, I’m wearing your sweater!”",Rose,last_nights_dream

In this place, people could test out their desired powers.  We went for a walk and were immediately on the lawn of the Richards. It was a well maintained yard with thich, evenly cut grass. Their large White House was in front of us. I felt uncomfortable about being in their yard.  We all approached their house and coming to a window close to the front of the house, everyone but me climbed through the window. I went around to the front door and waited for them to open it for me.  When I entered I walked into the living area and down a short hall to the kitchen where my mother was speaking with Mrs. Richards and a middle aged woman. I stood around not knowing what to say. I walked further down the hall and entered a large bar room where my dad spoke with a young man with long black hair.

1267,1441,,04/09/2020,09/04/2020 00:02,"“The Hanson Family Home” I am at a picnic table outside near the side of a road. There are two picnic tables. Although we can’t see the cars driving by from this area, I know we’re right beside a highway. There’s a gravel shoulder at the edge of a big road on one side of us. There’s a rough grassy area that’s speckled with dirt and gravel; there’s not very much growing there, just a little bit of grass. These two picnic tables are angled in an L-shape. There's a really rough structure, like what you’d find at a really old gas station store, but there are no gas pumps. So I’m sitting there and we’ve got some kind of meal. We’re evaluating whether or not this thing you sit in can be seen or noticed. One looks like a bathtub and the sides are copper, but it’s copper coating over enamel and the copper is being used to disguise it; the edges are probably about fourteen inches. There’s another one where the edges do not come up so high and they are only about six inches tall, but there’s a lip around the outside. It’s also been copper coated. We’re sitting in them on top of the picnic table bench. The other people at the table (not in the tubs) are saying whether or not this is noticeable. We think the shorter one will be less noticable. As it turns out, when we get a good look at them and people are sitting in them, the one that goes up fourteen inches kind of hugs your rib cage and sits under your armpits and because of the copper color, blends in with what people are wearing. You can’t really notice anyone is sitting in it as they’re eating. Whereas the other one has that big lip that sticks out and it’s a vast color difference between the tub and the people’s bodies and the shape of it is unnatural. So, we’re reporting back that the shorter one is not a good disguise. Then the scene changes and we’re in the Hanson’s house, only there is hardly any furniture in it and in some rooms, there’s none. The parents are there. The mom especially is more visible than the dad but I know he’s there somewhere. We walk in the door and the mom is sitting on a ladder facing away from it. She’s reading something. We go through that room which is empty of furniture. We go into a sitting room with a couch along one wall and where the tv would have been, there is nothing. No one is sitting there. Then we walk into what would have been the dining room. Again, there’s nothing in it. We go into the kitchen, which is now just an island attached to the wall with cupboards overtop. We walk in between the island and the wall to where the kitchen sink and counter occupy the whole end of the wall. I’m with Carrie, the youngest member of the family. Her older sister was my best friend in high school and in real life she’s gone - she died of cancer - but in my dream she’s still there as a ghost. Carrie and I are trying to wash a mountain of dishes that their four brothers and friends created. It’s horrible! I pick up one bag off the floor; it’s a shopping bag that was full of egg salad and some of the egg salad spills out onto the floor. I’m trying to scoop it up back into the abg. There’s all this gooped on food and you can’t even wash the dishes until you sort out dirty dishes from garbage, so we’re doing that. As we’re doing that, we’re hearing a conversation coming from the room with the couch. We’re both listening and trying to figure out what the two guys are saying. One is one of her middle brothers. He sounds different though. The other is a stranger and we don’t know who he is. The stranger sounds like he’s trying to sell something to her brother. We just don’t understand what he’s trying to sell and it doesn’t make any sense. Her brother is kind of interested but not responding entirely favorably to the sales pitch. Then there’s silence - they both fall silent. I said to her: “Don’t your parents live in a different house now? Did they keep this house you grew up in? Are just you kids living in it? Are you all splitting the mortgage or rent?” Then, we turn around and the stranger is coming in through what would have been the eating kitchen. He stands there and addresses us; he’s trying to give us the same pitch. I’m highly suspicious of him. He looks and sounds slimy like a salesman trying to sell something that isn’t authentic. He looks wormy - his body shape is kind of wormy; he’s really pale and slender and he’s got tight cropped mousy brown hair and a nondescript face. I automatically don’t like him. Carrie and I look at each other with a slitty eyed look, like, “Right this guy’s gotta go!” She says, “I’ll handle this.” She turns around and says, “Come here.” I continue cleaning up the dishes and am making some headway now - I scrape the garbage into one bag and am washing. When I’m finished, I go into the room where they are. The guy that I thought was her brother was actually a student from my advanced yoga teacher training, only he’s gained 200 pounds. He’s wearing an old man’s housecoat that you put on over your head. You can sort of see the rolls of fat of his body through the mesh of the robe and it has the big cotton pockets on the front. He and Carrie have obviously had some kind of conversation and the stranger is gone. We go back through the room where her mom was sitting on the ladder, but her mom is gone. Now we’re climbing up the stairs to go to the upper floor with just three bedrooms. Two of the boys share one, the other two share another and Carrie and her sister share the third. But Ellie’s bed is empty and Carrie is in the room by herself. She answers the question I asked her earlier and says, “No, we don’t have an extra house. This is still our family home.” I’m surprised and feel confused because in the pictures, there is furniture in the house and this one doesn’t look like either home. I look over at Ellie’s empty bed and it is still the way she left it the last time she slept there. It has the green plaid bedspread and some of the ways she would have creatively decorated their tiny room. There’s something of mine in the room, too, because I stayed overnight there. I decide to pack my things up and it’s time to go.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I was under the impression that I had been living there all along and was still going to live there. This Whitlock kid and I had a very amicable relationship. Then this other kid around the same age was trying to take over.

1278,1443,,06/09/2020,09/06/2020 00:03,"“The Arrangement” The setting is a house I lived in upstairs from the doctor’s office. There are a lot of people in it. The surfaces are covered with trays of finger food. It’s some kind of reception, but I’m not sure what kind. I don't feel any attachment to the trays of finger food, so I don’t think I made them. There is a twenty-five to twenty-eight year old man and he’s talking to me and telling me that when he gets back he’s going to put together the jacket that represents the college that has the name of the program on the back of it together for me because I’ve earned it. I see in my mind’s eyes the word, “Placement” on the back of the jacket. Then he is absorbed by the crowd of other people. I’m talking to them and realize I’m responsible for a department at the college again - the field placement department. Then the people who are there gradually start to clear out, but the man stays. We get into a car. We drive about an hour and a half to his house. It’s in a rural area and has recently been excavated. There’s a little rock garden around it, but not much. You can see where large sections of the earth have been pushed back by an excavator machine. The house is built around the two levels of ground. It’s so rocky that part of the house has been built into the rock or against it and the upper floor is above the earth. We go through the house. He shows me the kitchen and the living room and the rooms down on the subterraneum level - I think it was just one big room. It’s a nice house and very spacious, but not ostentatious. Then he says I can either stay there while he’s gone or he can drive me back to the other place. I elect to be driven back to the other place for work. I’m wondering what my relationship with this man is. He drives me back to town and drops me off. There are still a lot of people around the other house. I go to work the next day at the school. I’m in charge of a kind of thing where the students all have to present something in the gymnasium. The gymnasium is open and there are different groups of students working on something. I realize I am both a dance teacher and a teacher of some kind of academia. I’m moving from one group to another making sure they’re ready and answering questions. One group is academic, the other group is dance. Then it comes as some surprise to me that I have to climb up onto the stage and sit on the bleachers. There are no stairs. I turn around with my back facing the stage. The stage comes up to my rib cage. I put my palms on the stage and hoist myself up so I’m sitting on it. There is a bleacher six inches from the edge of the stage so I’m trying to turn myself around. Without knocking into the people sitting on the stage, I’m trying to get up onto my knees and then from there onto my feet. It’s hard for me to do this. I’m bumping into the person sitting closest to the stage. It’s Annette. She gives me a friendly encouraging look. My balance is all off and I feel wobbly. There’s nowhere to step so I just shuffle around. There is an opening for people to sit on the next level of bleachers, but I’m thinking: Where do I climb over? How do I get to the next? Instead of climbing over people I don’t know, I see a space beside Annette and climb over there. She says, “Well I’ll just sit with you.” This gives me a little bit more room to maneuver my body and the two of us go up to where there is n opening for two people. There’s some kind of conductor on the floor of the gymnasium. Someone is waving their hands around and the movement of their arms is communicating some kind of message to the people on the bleachers. No one is singing. It’s just words. So we stand there until the conductor is done. One bleacher at a time, we spiral down and jump off of the stage. There are tables lined up on that side of the gymnasium. I go down there and take a seat. The man that was with me previous to this is there now and joins me. I realize that it’s some kind of arranged marriage and everyone is aware of this and I’m just now understanding this. So I’m looking at him with different eyes. He seems like a nice person but we haven’t had any time to get to know each other. I don’t know him. The people who are there seem to think we do know each other. They’re asking me questions or alluding to ideas that only someone within an intimate knowledge of someone else would have. I sidestep these because I don't really understand what’s happening. Now we are seated, the man and I, with someone else - a colleague. This other person has nowhere to stay because the hotels and motels seem to be booked up. I feel like he is hoping for an invitation from us to stay in the house. But I am not comfortable with inviting him, so I don’t. But my arranged husband does. There’s another person accompanying us. Shortly thereafter, we’re all in my arranged husband’s car and driving up towards his house. It’s almost nighttime. We arrive at twilight, get out of the car, and go into the kitchen. Now I’m responsible for making food. I’ve got some baskets for bread. The man who is the colleague and my arranged husband go downstairs. They’re working on a collaborative project. I’m putting together eggs and bacon. The colleague comes up to ask if I need help. I say no. He says, “Well, is there anything else I can eat? I’m hungry.” I say, “Here.” I say here, “You can make the toast.” I make the eggs and bacon. I put those on a tray and take it downstairs. Something shifts and I’m feeling more at home. I’m feeling a warmth or curiosity to be warmed by the arranged husband. As I’m placing the food, I touch him on the arm lightly with my hand and ask if he needs anything else. There’s some kind of memory that surfaces. I remember being in a bookstore and wanting to buy him something. I’ve got ten or twelve books in my mind, anyone which he would like. But none of those books are in the bookstore. I question the vendor if she will have them in soon.

The window was open and high bushes and flowers pressed against the side of the house and crept a few inches into the house. I stretched out my hand and felt among the flowers when I noticed that there was a bumblebee flitting lazily from flower to flower. I carefully began to shut the window before the bee could get inside, but I was too slow. My dad was sitting across from me and coming to my aid, he trapped the bee against my clothing and killed or injured it. I was unhappy about this.  .....  We began talking and the subject of Christianity came up. I remember saying that if I had lived in an earlier time I would have not been a Christian. It had something to do with life being boring and that it was only the modern complexities and interests of life that allowed me to claim Christianity while in reality being absorbed in worldly affairs. In a simpler time, the only meaning to be found would be in the all-important task of evangelism and that is one thing which I am not putting first in my life.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

1283,922,,08/09/2020,09/08/2020 00:01,"I’m going to a theatre show with my mom, sister and two other women. There’s five of us. We are walking down the steps to the seats. I’m wearing a silk blue gown and a fur stole. I’m trying to wrap it around my neck in an elegant way, but look quite awkward. We thought we were early, but as we try to find our seats, we have trouble finding five in a row. There are some openings for four seats, but not five. The chairs are plush red velvet. We’re walking up the aisle looking for a spot. People are saving empty seats with clothing and other items. We have to walk pretty far away from the stage to find a row, but eventually do. We file in and I take note of the people around us. After the show, which I don’t recall, we go out to a balcony. A man joins me. He is a little creepy. He puts headphones on me. He also has a set. He plays a short meditation on his iphone. I’m supposed to drop in and have a consciousness altering experience. But I’m worried about what his ulterior motive might be. Then some light dance music comes on. I’m still somewhat listening but others come out on the deck and I’m wanting to interact with them. A man talks to the creepy guy about his coaching program. I somehow see a digital display of this program. It’s based on the life, death and rebirth of Jesus. I comment on transformation as a moment of life and how it relates to Jesus’ death on the cross. I’m quite intrigued by the life design coaching program and want to know more. A tidal wave is coming, but people are in the ocean, on the beach, and standing on the balcony nearby watching unconcerned. We’re trying to warn them so they survive. I climb up onto a wooden lifeguard stand with some other people. We are looking out at a crowd. There is some kind of trial or judgement happening. They pass a microphone up to us on the stand. The creepy man who is maybe not so creepy anymore is up on the stand. He hides his face so they won’t recognize him as he speaks in favor of the person being judged. I have to get away. I know that Mary is somewhere in the crowd and she needs to get away, too.",Ana,last_nights_dream
1284,1227,,08/09/2020,09/08/2020 00:02,"I’m with two guys, one of them is Josh. We’re at a zoo. We’re looking at the displays and I’m sad about animals being in the zoo. But, I don't actually see any animals. The displays are all empty. I walk into one of them and am trying to show Josh and the other guy, maybe he’s my brother, that your eyesight is limited from the point of view of the animal. I’ve walked into the display area and am looking out to where the crowds would be standing. I say, “See you can only see so much if you’re in here.” I try to show them this. Then I turn around and it’s like there’s an inside part of these displays that opens up into a huge cylinder shaped room that opens up to the sky. Inside are more cages and laboratories and places for the animals. I want to explore this. The other two come in with me. We’re curious. We don't know exactly what is happening in this area of the zoo. I still can’t see any animals. Except, as I get closer, I’m looking at a lot of metal and cages and fluorescent lights. As I’m looking, these tiny, maybe three inches tall, koala bears show up. They’re climbing this little bird stand with the wide dish at the bottom for bird seed. There isn't a cage around it, though. The tiny koalas are hyper and all over the place. This scientist zoologist comes out with a black house cat (his familiar?) and I’m like, “Oh my gosh! I want to hold this tiny koala!” The scientist says, “Don’t touch the tiny koala. They’re on something. I don’t know what they might do to you. They might bite you. They might scratch you. So just leave them alone.” So I just look at them. At first there was one, then there were two, then there were like fifty of them swarming this little stand. They are moving kind of crazily. I back up a little bit. We’re just poking around this inside place and looking for other animals. I get a sense that there are other things we could be doing than this. The scene changes. I don't know what happens to the other two. I’m in this outdoor area that reminds me of a college campus. There’s a football team going by. It’s Fall, leaves are falling, there are leaves on the ground and it’s kind of chilly. I’m wearing shorts and a shirt. A lot of the football players are classmates from school, but there are also a bunch of them that I don’t recognize. As the football team files past me some of them who are my old classmates say hi. They’re really excited to see me. I realize this is because I’m wearing velvet bootie shorts and a tiny little crop top. So, they seem like they’re happy to see me but I think it’s just because of what I’m wearing. Somehow I’m wearing this because it’s one of those fall days where it’s still pretty warm in the middle of the day. Apparently the temperature isn’t bothering me. I turn around and go to this larger grassy area where there are a bunch of people gathered. They’re all on their own blankets. I go to the spot with a bunch of friends. I don't recognize all the people on the blanket but I get the sense that I know them because they say, “Hey Rose!” and I sit down and we’re talking. At one point, Ana shows up with her son. They are so brown - their skin is so dark and they’re totally naked! I’m like, “Those two have been out in the sun all summer! I’m jealous!” They’re the only two who are naked. The rest of us have some kind of clothing on. But the thing that stands out is how tan the two of them are. Then, I leave the blanket and go into a house or something. I’m heading towards the inside and set up a lawn chair for myself. Then someone wants to talk to me and I get distracted and go elsewhere. I do the interaction but don’t remember what it is. I think it’s a football player who was one of my old classmates and wants to talk. He tries to convince me to come watch the game or go to some sort of after party. I finish that interaction and go back to sit in my chair, but someone is in my chair. This happens like three times where I go talk to someone and go back to my chair, but the chair I’ve set up for myself, someone else is in it. The first two times I get a new chair. The third time I’m like, “Yo, that’s my chair! Get out. I set that up for me.” The person who is in it this last time is a cranky older gentleman. He maybe needs the chair more than I do. I’m pissed off about losing my chair yet again, but thinking maybe he actually needs it. Then again, one more football player comes over and wants to talk to me. It’s like they all want to spend time with me and go on a date. They want me to come to their football games and just be around them. There’s a funny earnestness and innocence in the way they’re showing up to try and get my attention. It’s not creepy at all. They’re not trying to be players or extra smooth. They just really want me around. They want my energy around. It’s funny.",Rose,last_nights_dream
1285,1444,,08/09/2020,09/08/2020 00:03,"“The Line Up” I’m in a doctor’s office but it’s actually some kind of ear specialty clinic. I’ve had an issue with my ears. My appointment was for 8am. I get there and am with a friend, a female friend. We’re sitting on a bench outside of the office. There’s a parallel line up, not part of the ear clinic but beside it where people are lined up to pay their gas bill. Their line up goes all the way down the sidewalk, wraps around the bottom of the hill where the traffic lights are and continues down the other side of the road and around the buildings then vanishes out of sight. I comment that if it weren’t traffic, the line would be graceful as it wraps around the urban setting. I comment to my friend that what we’re looking at is the demographic of people who don’t believe in paying their bills online or don’t trust banks. She makes some kind of argument but I can’t remember what it is now. I debate back that yes, I see your point but we’re still looking at that demographic. I try and study it. I'm looking at the pole., their faces, what they’re wearing, and trying to listen to snippets of their conversation. It’s mostly elderly people. But there’s also a middle aged group of scruffy looking men. I notice millennials there as well. Then our number gets called and we enter the ear clinic. We have another line up in there. It’s now 11:30am and my appointment was scheduled for 8. I’m starting to get hungry and feel frustrated. Then it’s 3pm. I’m still not there. There are about four people ahead of me and I know the clinic closes at 5. I approach the desk and say, “My appointment was at 8. It’s 3pm. I’m really getting tired and hungry and thirsty. What's going on?” The receptionist who looks like my son’s counselor crawls underneath the desk and speaks to me from there. She says, “I’m really sorry. This isn’t by my design. People get upset by this all the time. They do this every time. Everyone’s appointment was scheduled for 8am.” I feel like screaming at her but I don’t. I tell her that I understand it’s not her fault, but inside I’m frustrated and angry. I’m dizzy and starting to get a headache. I go back and sit down. Now it’s almost 5pm. There is a person that does the procedure I came for and I know they tend to leave a little bit earlier than the rest of the staff. I go back to the desk and say, “Am I still going to be able to get this done today?” She says, “Well, you have two choices. You can wait until we open in the morning or I can give you this syringe and you can inject yourself at home. You still have to wait for your appointment.”I have this dissonance between my inner landscape which is angry and frustrated and tired and hungry and thirsty with what I’m saying to her. I tell her I’ll take the syringe full of medicine. Then I say, “Well wait a sec, if I have to stay anyways, is she going to be back tomorrow?” She tells me she is. I say, “Well nevermind then, I might as well wait and have her do it properly since I have to stay here overnight anyway.” She hands it to me anyway, and says, “Well take it just in case.” She hands me a syringe full of liquid medicine. I go back and realize that while I’ve been talking to her someone who arrived after me has gone in and got their appointment. I’m unbelievably agitated. I also realize this is just great, I’m going to have to stay overnight because you’re not allowed to go home. If you go home they put you back in the line up, so it’s a never ending cycle of having to wait from 8am until the end of the day when they can’t even take you. I push two chairs together and try and stretch my body across the chairs. My friend is doing the same thing. We take off our coats and use them as pillows and lie down. The night passes with me not being able to sleep because I’m too hungry and too thirsty. I wish I had water. I’m feeling that restlessness in your legs from not getting enough exercise. So, I start to walk around the building. I walk around twenty times and then come back in and it’s past midnight. I get back in the chairs and go to sleep. I sleep for maybe five minutes and am woken up. Some part of the chair is sticking in my back - it’s wooden and pressing in my thigh so I feel like I’m getting a bruise. I stay awake until I see the morning light coming into the building. I sit up in my chair and see the people come back to the desk. I feel like threatening them somehow and saying I’d better be first! That’s when I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

We found one where there were only two people in front of bbn us. The first was a man wearing dark clothes and the woman checking out was larger with blonde hair. She was complaining about the popcorn that she had bought as there was a problem with it. However she was not speaking coherently and no one could understand what she meant. A manager came over with some complaint forms on a clipboard. It didn't matter because while she kept talking her language was completely unrelated to her problem. She spoke of oil and kept making tangents and describing bizarre things. I began to suspect her of mental illness and began to study her face closely. I was looking down at her as if I were floating above her. She looked my way and almost noticed that I was watching. She kept rambling and the workers were at a loss. I thought about telling them that she was psychotic and that they should just send her away. I approached the checkout counter and pulling out a small piece of paper wrote down something about psychosis in blue ink. I thought about asking the woman if she had a mental illness or if she had stopped taking her meds.,Bob,last_nights_dream2

1291,1445,,09/09/2020,09/09/2020 00:01,"“Strange Working Vacation” I’m in the town I spent my middle childhood in. I’m outside. I am on the street that intersects with the main street in town. It used to have the Central Hotel on it. I’m around the area where that hotel used to be but it doesn’t look like that now. There’s an open area. None of the stores that used to be ther are there. It’s just grass and an amphitheatre. Then as you move towards the main street, those stores stay there and there are two areas within that block that are associated with the amphitheatre and grassy area - it’s some kind of daycare. As the dream opens and I see this physical setting, I am to go to each of the three areas. My shift begins with spending fifteen minutes in each one so that one of the two staff can have their fifteen minute break, then I am to have the rest of my shift in one continuous place. First I start in the amphitheatre. The kids are older, maybe 6-8 years old. They’re building something out of wood. I have a really big giant cardboard box that’s really sturdy. I don’t know what would have been in it, maybe an adult car, it’s that big. It’s on its side and they’re putting the pieces of lumber in it. I don’t really know what they’re building but they’re quite busy with it. They’re sprinkling some bits of cut grass into it and they’re quite industrious. I just supervised from afar to make sure they’re playing safely with the lumbar and no one is getting their fingers pinched or hurt. That fifteen minutes goes by. The staff I relieved comes back. I walk around the corner and go into one of the buildings that looks like a store but is a daycare room with younger children. It’s a mixed group of boys and girls and it’s a little less organized. Whereas, the boys were working together on their creation outside, this is more chaotic and the kids are running from center to center. There isn’t the collective community that I felt in the outdoor space. I’m not really sure what I’m supposed to be supervising but again I just stand there, not really involved. There are a lot of colors - it’s a sea of colors and kids. I make sure nobody is throwing anything at each other. Because I don't really understand what they’re doing and it doesn't look like they’re really doing anything except running around, I’m prepared to apply first aid should anything happen. Fifteen minutes is over and that staff comes back in. I exit the building and walk up the street towards the theatre to the final place. This time I don’t enter. There’s a child a little bit younger, maybe 3 or 4, standing outside the building. I don’t even know if the child is male or female and it doesn’t matter in the dream, so I’ll use the pronoun “they.” They are wanting a pair of shoes that are on a shoe rack outside the center. They choose one that’s made of many many straps of leather, all woven together to create the shoe. The child is non-verbal. They pick up one of these shoes from the rack and set it beside their own foot. I marvel at the fact that they’ve chosen the exact same size shoe that will fit their foot. As they set their shoed foot beside the woven shoe, they’re exactly the same length and width. I think that’s pretty good! Then, they sit down on the sidewalk, remove their own shoe and put on the other one, then stand up and press their foot in the shoe against the sidewalk a couple times the way someone would do if they’re trying on a shoe to see if it feels right when they’re standing up. Apparently it does. The child gives a nod of approval and go to the building entrance. I say, “Well, don’t you want the other shoe?” The child doesn’t respond to me. I’m thinking we need to pay for these shoes and I wonder if that child has any money. I’m just curious. So I follow the child inside the building. The child walks to the back and then engages themself in something going on at the back of the store. I wonder if the owner of the store is going to say something about not paying for the show or only having one shoe, but he doesn’t. I just wait around and all I’m doing is making sure nothing terrible happens. Nothing does. Shortly, my break coverage is over and I exit the building. I walk back up the street, turn left at the corner and am working in the amphitheatre. I’m not in charge of the kids making the thing out of lumber with the big blocks now. I’m doing something in the amphitheatre. Once I get into the amphitheatre, it’s a little darker than it is outside. There’s a lot of sorting of things with regard to clothes. There are kids that are in need of clothes. It’s a great big giant stage full of clothing donations. We’re supposed to be sorting them into shorts, pants, jackets and anything else that arises as you go through these piles, so this is what I’m doing. Then, my daughter as a child appears. She’s around 8. I notice that she doesn’t have any shorts. I wonder if it would be okay to give her a couple of pairs if there are any that fit her from this giant pile of donations. The time passes with sorting of clothes. My daughter is helping a bit here and there, moving between the piles. There are other people here too doing the same job. As we complete the sorting, the sun is setting. We’ve been doing this all day. I look and see she has a couple pairs of shorts and someone has given them to her, so we just put them in a bag. We walk across the field and keep walking. I notice we’re in a meadow now. We’re still walking and the sun sets and we’re in twilight. I wonder if we’re going to have anywhere to sleep. Suddenly, we just reach what looks like an upside down boat, just the hull. It has a doorway so we go in. Inside is a big room, hallway and two bedrooms. The big room is sunny. We have two beds, one for her and one for me. I don’t know who has the other bedroom down the hallway. I put my daughter to bed with a little story and brush her teeth. I put her in the bigger bed and I take the smaller bed off to the side. However, I can’t sleep. I’m worried about money. I go to the dresser, open the top drawer and see my wallet. I take it out and recount my money. There are a few hundred dollar bills, a few fifties, a couple twenties and tens. I think that will do us for a couple of weeks. Then, I put the money back in my wallet, back in my purse and close the top drawer. Then, I open the other door and go down the hallway. Someone has been sleeping in the other two bedrooms, but I can hear the shower is on and they’re in the bathroom showering. So I go into the one bedroom and see some of my and my daughter’s things in there - articles of clothing. I think someone has been taking our things while we were away working. I gather up my belongings and take them down the hallway and put them in the bedroom where my daughter is sleeping. I walk back down to the other bedroom and see the same thing. Some of my barrettes are in there and a couple of my daughter’s things - articles of clothing. I collect them up. Then I decide to look further into the room to see if there are some other things of ours. I look under the bed, nothing there. I take what’s ours and go back to the bedroom. Now I’m wondering if my money has been safe while we were out working. I go back into the top drawer, into my purse, and my wallet is missing! I look where I’m sleeping and see it in a different bag. I think that’s strange. I’m sure I left my wallet in the top drawer of the dresser. I wonder if the person left the bathroom, came in and took my wallet, then put it back in the wrong spot. When I open the wallet and count, all the money is still there. At this point, my daughter is starting to stir. So, I tell her, “I think this is our last day here. If you want to go for one more swim in the pool, we should do it now.” She does. So, we change. She wears a little pair of shorts. I don’t have a bathing suit so I’m just wearing something that won’t be too hot as I stand outside and watch her swim. We do that. I think we’d better hurry. I tell her swimming is over. We go back in and she changes. I explain that we need to start folding up our things now so they fit in the suitcase and they need to be folded really tightly because our suitcase isn’t very big. Then I’m not sure how we’re getting from this place to the next place we need to go. I text my friend and ask what time they’re coming to get us. While we wait for her to text back my daughter and I continue rolling up all our clothing into little rolls - flattening them out, folding them in half, then rolling them so they fit in the case.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

She’s showing me the layout of a room at a hotel in Hawaii that will be mine when we get a chance to vacation together again. She’s hoping we can all be together again soon. It looks really nice - wood floors, high ceilings, view of the ocean, lots of windows. I talk to her a little longer but I’m distracted looking for my husband, I see a bunch of kids horsing around on the deck by the pool. The deck is made up of a couple levels - more like a deck to launch botas off at the river than a poolside deck. My son is at the edge. I’m worried because no one is really watching him. He jumps into the pool before I can stop him. I dive in after him. I look up at him from underneath the water and am surprised because he’s actually swimming. He’s not yet three and in waking life he has not wanted to practice his swimming or get his head under the water this summer. He swims all the way to the edge and is super proud of himself. I’m really proud of him, too. Then we have to continue looking for my husband. I can’t reach him by phone. I see him. He is flirting with this pregnant woman. They are both smoking cigarettes. She asks my husband what kind of cigarette he wants next. I’m horrified and disgusted because he quit smoking years ago and now he’s getting back into that addiction. Plus, he seems very taken by this other woman. She has oily hair and looks drunk, too. I’m so mad at him. And he’s just shrugging me off.

He almost tells her an email address that he has kept secret from me. It’s a private email address that he uses for this kind of stuff as well as porn subscriptions. It’s “WhyNotHard” or “WhyNot&Hard” or something like that. This makes me even more mad because he clearly has a secret life. I’m trying to figure out what to do. I’m angrily whispering to him and berating him for his deception and trying to get the whole email address and password so I can find out what else he’s been up to. Then I look across the picnic table where we’re sitting and see three black trans women who are obviously together. One of them starts to sing and tells me she’s been watching and listening to the whole drama. She’s laughing because she’s been there before. They are all singing a song and the scene shifts. It’s like we are in a music video. We are standing under trees by a body of water. There are brown leaves covering the ground. I see an ice blue woman naked and lying partially hidden under the leaves. I wonder if she is me. I can’t recall what happens next. But then I am trying to teach a yoga class to a group of people who are wanting really advanced trick poses. I can do and teach these poses but I want to slowly warm them up and prepare them to do it safely. But, nobody is really paying attention. They have this better than thou attitude that turns me off. I don't want to continue teaching to people who are so disrespectful.",Ana,last_nights_dream
1299,1228,,10/09/2020,09/10/2020 00:02,"The first part of the dream is a bunch of kids who seem young, maybe twelve or thirteen. I’m in the mix and my body might be twelve or thirteen but my brain is definitely an adult’s brain. We’re at this boarding school. There are six of us who are learning how to be astronauts. We’re wandering around and we find this office with all of the gear we would need to get on the spaceship, fly it, and head to the moon. So we’re collecting all this stuff. It’s stuff that the other astronauts who have already been to the moon have used. It’s their things. We’re collecting it because we’re going to go. I’m simultaneously one of the kids collecting the things and also the adult going, “Oh gosh, these kids are going to kill themselves. It’s not safe. I need to stop them.” I’m playing both roles, which is weird. The enthusiasm of the kids is really high and cute. But it’s not feasible for them to suddenly get on a spaceship and head up to space because they’re twelve. They have all their things. I don’t know if their professors or the actual astronauts find us in their office. We snuck in. there’s a sense that we shouldn’t be there. They come in. It's two or three of the astronauts who are also teachers. They sit down and I can tell they know what we’re trying to do and there’s no way in hell it’s going to happen. But they indulge us. They are asking the kids all these questions: “How are you going to do this, this and this? How are you going to take care of this? What food are you going to eat? The food question is funny because we’re all actually eating food and some of the kids are wanting to share the food with the astronauts. I can tell that the other kids are not aware that these teachers are the actual astronauts. They haven’t put that together yet. I’m watching all of this and also in the conversation and offering some of my food to one of the astronauts even though I know they’re going to say no. the reason they’re asking all these questions is that at some point they’re going to say we can’t do all this stuff because we’re not prepared. We are sitting around a rounded desk. This goes on for a while. The scene changes. We never get on a spaceship or anything. The teachers/astronauts never say, “No you’re not going,” or “You’re in trouble for breaking into the office.” I keep waiting for that to happen and it doesn’t happen. It’s like the astronauts are so bemused by the excitement and enthusiasm of the kids that they let it play out. Then I am hanging with Johnny and Amanda again - I’ve known both of them since second grade. They were married seven or eight years ago and now have a couple kids. Johnny is the leader again. He has a group of people with him. I don’t recognize all the people, but I do see Amanda there. He’s pretty upbeat and everybody is excited to be there. We are outside in my backyard somehow. At one point, I’m watching him and he’s moving around the crowd. He comes to me and picks me up. We’re holding hands and our arms are locked. I’m using all of my muscles to stay upright. He’s moving me around like in acroyoga. I am thinking how this takes a lot of shoulder strength to hold me up like this. It takes a lot of shoulder strength on my end to hold myself up like this, too! Everybody is having a good time. Then suddenly it’s time to go. It’s time to move on. It’s time for Johnny to move his group of people and I’m with them. Now I have a pair of roller skates on. There are a couple other other moms in this group as well, and they also have roller skates on. There are younger kids with roller skates on. There are moms wearing their kids. I think Amanda is wearing a baby. I watch them go. I think I should also grab my tennis shoes in case we have to go uphill or we have to go inside where roller skates are not a good idea. So I’m watching them go and decide to go with them first because I want to see where they go. I forget to get my shoes. I can feel how fast I’m gliding in these roller skates and it’s a lot of fun. There are other moms in this group. I’m at the back of the crowd. We are skating down streets but the streets are cracked and there’s grass growing up out of the streets. So it’s not super smooth. I realize I really do need to get my shoes. The group is going really slow so I do have time to skate back to my place and grab my shoes. Wherever we’re going, we are leaving these places for good. We aren’t coming back. I leave the group and it kind of feels a little bit painful but I know I’ll be able to find them because I’m on roller skates and I’m going faster than they are. I know I’ll be able to hear them. So I roller skate back to my house up this hill. I’m going really fast. I grab my tennis shoes and put them in this backpack. Instead of going the way I came with the group, I cut across all of these streets. The streets remind me of the streets around the college I went to - residential area for college students and professors. There are tall trees. The cracks in the sidewalk are still there. Things look kind of old and there is ivy growing on things. There are lots of flowers on the lawns. Then I get to an apartment complex with multiple levels. All of these levels are connected by stairs. I’m like, “Yeah, stairs and roller skates, not going to happen.” So I put my tennis shoes on. I can hear the group. Johnny is shepherding them at this point. My friend Ikaika who I have also known since second grade and grew up with is now in the group, too. They’re trying to go up one of the sets of stairs on the outside of the apartment building. There is a younger woman - well, she’s the same age as everyone in the group, we’re all younger than we are in real life, maybe in our twenties or early thirties. She’s like, “No, you cannot take this entire group through this apartment complex and go up these stairs.” It’s interesting because the streets I’m on are two or three levels above where the group is trying to climb the stairs to get up to these streets. So they’re definitely at a lower level of the road or something. Johnny is trying to bring them up the stairs and Ikaika is trying as well. Those two are super frustrated. I go and talk to the young woman. But I have to go through somebody’s apartment. It’s a college apartment so there are four people crammed into this tiny apartment and this is why the woman is saying, “No, stop trying to bring this group of people up through this. It’s small and there’s not enough room for them! And you’re disturbing all of us who live here. You’re not taking into account the fact that we live here. You are singing loudly. You have kids. You have roller skates on.” I’m listening to her and she is pissed off. She’s not having it. She has blond hair down to her shoulders. Her skin is tan. She looks a bit ratty, not well kept. I go to talk to Johnny and Ikaika and say, “You guys, we can go around. We don’t need to go through these peoples’ homes to get up to this next level.” They are so frustrated. They can’t see any other way than to come up the stairs. I’m saying, “No, lets’ go around. There’s a road over here you can go up.” The dream ends here at an impasse with all these people trying to come up and this one girl trying to keep them out. I’m trying to convince them to go up around this road. No one arrives at a solution.",Rose,last_nights_dream

1305,762,,11/09/2020,09/11/2020 00:01,"I was at my childhood home and Bea was there with me. My childhood home was on a really busy street and I would often see people that I knew drive by and some people would stop by if we were outside in the front. We were sitting at a picnic table on the corner and some people started trickling in from my past and it was like a block party. There was food and people were singing karaoke I think or call in response and the party kept going until the evening. This girl that I don’t know who kind of looks like Avril Lavigne but more severe came through. Everyone really liked her and she was very charismatic and kind of abrupt, but in a way that was charming. She started singing and then into the evening she started singing worship songs like Jesus church songs. I was like what is this? I wasn’t down but everyone was immediately down and then at the end of the evening she pulled me and Bea aside and started talking about her funeral. We didn’t know her so we asked, “Oh are you like terminally ill?” and she’s like, “No, but I plan to die tonight.” Again I’m shook, but Bea seemed fine. She proceeded to tell us that she wanted us to sacrifice her to absolve humanity of its burdens and sins, like she was the second coming of Christ - she didn’t say that but that was the vibe. I didn’t want to do it but everyone else seemed totally down to do it. I also didn’t believe her that she wanted to do that. I kind of thought that maybe she was suicidal but because she was so religious she couldn’t kill herself so she needed somebody else to do it, so she was using the situation to her advantage to get into heaven. We turned on the incinerator which for some reason was in my backyard and prepping for the sacrifice. I asked her what she wanted her story to be when people were investigating this act and she said that no one would find out that it happened so there wouldn’t be an investigation and then I woke up.",Tita,last_nights_dream

I also see another black cat , and possibly a third black and white one and I assume they came from that apartment. I knock on the door and ask if the cats are theirs. A woman responds that they are and I gather the kittens together and shove them through the door.  Later we are all hanging out and talking outside of the apartments. It is crowded and everyone is milling about. I begin to suspect my sister of plotting to kill my brother. She has given him a bag of smarties which I am sure are poisoned.

1308,1446,,12/09/2020,09/12/2020 00:01,"“The Red Coat” I’m in the Central Hotel for a gathering. There are a lot of people. It’s packed. It feels dark and stuffy. I’m wearing a red jacket over a dress. Someone who works there takes my jacket and hangs it up for me. I go to sit down at a table. I’m supposed to meet people there. As I sit down, I realize that everyone is meeting there prior to moving next door for a wedding. I take my seat and am scanning the room for people I know. I don’t see anyone I know. I just sit in the seat. I’m waiting until we are going to be notified that we’re moving. Then it seems rather sudden that someone from the hotel circulates through the guests telling them it’s time to move. They’re saying things that cause us to be hasty and move quickly and not to linger. I get up and move with the flow of the crowd. We exit out the front door and immediately take a left and go into the door beside it, then up a long set of stairs and into a big room. The room we just left was crowded and stuffy but had kind of a homey atmosphere - the decor was of wood with wood posts that held the ceiling up and it had that well oiled hand hewn feel to it. This upstairs room is just one big rectangle that’s maybe hastily put together. No one sits and stays for a long time. It remains empty. There’s no warmth when you walk in. There's a long table. I don’t know if I’m supposed to sit here. Again, I’m scanning the room for people I know. I see two people who used to live in my neighborhood and I thought were my friends. They know I’m there but keep to themselves and make no effort to come talk to me. I seem to know the people I’m sitting with but I can’t identify them in the dream. I realize we’re here for a reception. The servers bring food out. Everybody has the same plate of food. We eat without gusto. The servers take the food away and place dessert on the table. I pick at it. They sit down jugs of beer, but I don’t normally drink beer. I take a little bit in a cup and it tastes refreshing and very cold. I drink about half my cup. People are getting up out of their seats and moving into smaller groupings. There’s lively talk coming from these groupings. I feel isolated and unwelcome. I’m not sure what the reception is for. I get up and circulate a little. There’s a little dancing. I want to dance but there’s no one to dance with. I like the music and am feeling the dance in my body but there’s no one to share it with. I see someone who used to be a neighbor and go down to her. She says hello and talks with me for a few minutes. We sit down in chairs. I go to show her something on Facebook, but there’s no internet signal and my phone won’t load it. She gets bored and wanders away while I’m waiting. I just close my phone up and put it back in my purse. I go into the original room where I saw my old neighbors and they’re still involved in a conversation. They see me but don’t wave or beckon me over. I feel like I just want to go home now. Then I realize my red jacket is missing. I ask one of the staff if it’s possible to go downstairs and get it from the coat rack. They tell me that downstairs is now closed. It’s really cold out and I need my jacket. Now I'm unsure what to do. I stand by the doorway and another staff person comes up and says, “I’ve found three red jackets downstairs. Is one of these yours?” I think the first one is. It’s a felt jacket and it’s long. I put it on as though I recognize it. It’s comfortable and feels like it fits me. Then I see the other red jacket and think, “Wait a minute, that’s my grandfather’s coat.” I say, “No, I’m sorry, I’m mistaken. The one I’m wearing is not mine. The noisy one is mine.” He says, “Well just keep the other one.” I say, “No, I can't do that, it’s not mine. It belongs to somebody.” He says, “Well, no one has claimed it. It’s been here for a long time.” I take it off and put on my grandfather’s coat. I’m holding it because he’s not giving me anywhere to put it. There are no hangers and he’s walking away. I feel uncomfortable that I have this coat that’s not mine. Then I go out the door because now they’re closing. I have this coat that doesn’t belong to me over my arm. I’m not sure how far to go with it, so I stand across the street because i can’t stay in the building.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

It’s making shadows of eyes on her cheeks and one over her brow. I remark on it and ask her about it. She shows me the scarf and how these symbols are made of metal and appliqued onto the ends of the scarf. She lies down on a table in a cold stone room. She enjoys it. My next person arrives - another yoga teacher. I’m a bit distracted while massaging her. I go upstairs and see Deanne and others on the third story getting chairs. I check in with Edward and see he’s with his family moving about and getting organized. I go back inside to the stone tower and see Deanne is receiving an oil treatment on her face.

The second was a terrible Jar Jar Binks impression which was so bad and yet obvious that I couldn't help but laugh while a younger boy was trying to guess it. Casey was present, but it was someone else asking the questions, either Doug or William. I had been skipped, maybe because I was a graduate who didn't entirely belong, and when it finally got to me, I was asked an impossible question: ""What is it like to fall in love?"" I had no way of answering such an abstract and experiential question and was going to pass when the answer popped into my head: ""Falling in love is becoming overcome by the beauty of another and having the light of their beauty shine in your heart like a star in the heavens."" Only the poetic could hope to answer adequately.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

I see my hula halau there - my kumu hula and all my hula sisters. They’re going to do a show. They’re like, “Come dance with us.” I’m standing there and am like, “I don’t remember any of the dances.” They’re like, “You’ll be fine.” They put me in a costume. I go to practice a little bit. The practice is not good. I don’t remember the dances. They also don’t remember. It’s like we haven’t practiced in a long time and we haven’t gotten together in a long time.

1329,1447,,16/09/2020,09/16/2020 00:02,"“For a Little While” I’m in a village. It’s a small community. People live close to each other. There is not a lot of space. People don’t live in houses. It’s outside living. People’s space is defined by what they have in it, which is mostly contained to sleeping quarters and the belongings they have that are necessary for daily life. My area is quite comfortable. I’m happy with it. I feel content. My sleeping area is soft, spacious. The covers are warm; it’s under my head and supports it and I have plenty of it. I am walking through the village holding the hand of a small child. I’m walking slowly to adjust to her pace. My heart, my body is full of love for her. I’m waiting for her dad. I know he’s there but he’s invisible. He has a presence but I haven’t seen him with my eyes yet. The time goes very very fast. A number of days blend into one moment. At this particular moment in time, I feel someone around me and behind me on the path where we’re walking. Today he materialises. I see him in the flesh. I feel my own flesh respond to his physical presence. I’m really happy to see him. We walk together for some time, hand in hand, enjoying being on a walk in the body. Then the village gradually gets a little closer together as the sun sets in the sky. It’s time for us to return to the sleeping quarters. As we approach, there’s food you can eat with your fingers that’s warm and savory. We both unwrap a small package of food that maybe fits in your hand. We eat it with our fingers. The packages are like skins. We squeeze them shut and set them down around the boundaries of our sleeping area. The things we’ve stacked around the sleeping area - our belongings - give us just enough privacy. Everyone goes to their sleeping quarters at the same time so there’s privacy from everyone else’s eyes for everyone. I feel the anticipation of being able to share our bodies tonight. The experience is very electric and satisfying. It creates a feeling of zest to taste life again. Then as dreams do, some days pass by in the blink of an eye. Again, we are sharing our bodies in our sleeping area. But this time my young daughter is not going to sleep as much. Something is disturbing her sleep. Her dad cuddles her until she falls asleep then he moves her off his chest very slowly so as not to wake her, and sets her at one side of the sleeping area. As he turns towards me, she lifts her head and is awake. Then we switch places. He’s on the left of me and I rock her in the bed. She feeds on my breast. I slowly turn over to my right side. I can feel her mouth unlatch. I slowly try to lower her a little onto the softness of the bed then turn back toward him. But he seems to be involved with some other activity and rolls off the bed. He leaves for a moment and then comes back to the bed. He’s only there for a moment. This repeats in a pattern. Then when the sun rises, I can feel things grow lighter. I know he’s still there in spirit but in the flesh he’s been called for some other purpose. I get up. This time when my daughter and I walk the path, there is a younger child with curly dark hair who appears to be an orphan. No one knows who her parents are. My very young child grabs this child by the hand and now we’re walking even more slowly. The young one barely old enough to walk, staggers. Her eyes are big and wide and round. She’s looking around. I think to myself, “She’s looking for the parents she doesn’t have.” I know that we will look after her though. So, hands linked, we walk. Some of the other villagers are staring at us. I can tell they are processing that we have absorbed this orphan child. Their thoughts about that are clear on their faces. Others are too absorbed in their own work and are not even noticing. I’m happy to look after her. She’s a beautiful spirit. At the same time, I miss my daughter’s father. I miss that he can’t stay with us. I wish that his physical body was present. I miss the act of union.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I’m picking up speed and running then flying over the ocean. I’m catching the wind and feeling free, but also realize the break is almost over and I need to get back to class quickly. I am skimming over the ocean, feeling the splash of the salt water. At first I’m going out to sea, then I catch the wind under my arms. A big wave is coming and I catch it. I’m surfing flying the wave like a pelican. I can feel the momentum and it’s exhilarating. It takes me right next to a rock face and between a narrow crevice of rocks. I can see the water rise as the wave and I approach. It’s as if time slows so I can precisely fly through this narrow area without catching the sides of the rocks. I make it to shore and return to the classroom. The desks have been rearranged. They are set up closer together. I recall having a conversation with a woman before break about where to sit. She’s a young Asian woman and reminds me of a Biology Major and Pre-Med student at Stanford University. We will be sitting next to each other at the back of the classroom. I arrive before she does and see her notebooks stacked on a chair. I move them over one so that my chair is closest to the professor’s desk. Other people are coming in now and finding their desks. The young Asian woman comes to sit next to me in the back. I get up and push the desks around so they aren’t so cramped together. She has just voted for the president. She is talking with me about how Edward has been communicating with her about upcoming projects and he’s looking to hire someone new at the end of October. I’m concerned that my work will be done and a new intern will come in. I’m uneasy about this. Then more students come in. The woman is yelling at the students and taunting them about not voting. She is very righteous in proclaiming that she already voted and used her break time wisely. She is telling them that they must vote now. The professor is now sitting at his desk. It’s Edward. The desk is in the far left back corner of the room facing the students. We are all in our chairs that have the desks attached to them facing the front of the room. There are blank chalkboards across the front. Edward raises his voice and sternly says, “We are not to take sides! In no way are we to take sides!” This quiets the woman and all the other students now. He’s clearly irritated and reviewing his lesson plan. He’s looking over a list of historic figures and saying the names aloud so we remember the ones he has talked about already. I’m hearing the names of these men, but it’s as though I’m hearing them for the first time. These are names of politicians that I feel like I should know but I do not.

It continues despite the fact that I’m sitting on the toilet and pushing something out of my body. I’m pushing shit out of my body. I don't have to strain too hard. My body does evacuate it pretty effortlessly. I can hear other people in the house but it’s more like white noise rather than distinct conversation. Then the person I’m talking to continues talking about mundane topics as though I’m not sitting on the toilet and I’m not evacuating shit from my body. I can feel my body is finished. Then I take the toilet paper from the roll on the wall, nothing unusual. As I try and wipe the remnants of it from myself, it feels like there’s gritty stuff like seeds. I wipe again. Now instead of there being less on the paper, there’s more. I repeat this process about six times. There’s more each time. I feel like it’s spreading it around the cheeks of my bum. And so, I think that this process is spreading it around me more. I don’t want to continue it. I need to go somewhere else where I can get clean. I tell the woman, “I can’t talk to you right now. I need to stop this.” She does leave. I take off all my clothes and get into the shower. I scrub myself from head to toe. I realize that the shower, the water, the soap is making me clean. I stop, rinse myself off and get out. I towel myself off. I feel clean now. But I’m disgusted at my clothes. I think they carry something.

1341,1449,,17/09/2020,09/17/2020 00:06,"“The Scavenger Hunt” I’m in this outdoor space. It’s like a big hill. There are a lot of rocks on the hill. There is some low growing grass. It’s like rolling lowlands. There are some flat spaces but also lots of places to climb. The trees are more like evergreen trees; they’re conifers. I don’t recall any deciduous trees at all. I’m with some people. We are tasked with finding these red marks. Each red mark indicates that there’s something hidden there and we have to follow the instructions or use the thing that’s hidden for the purpose that it’s hidden for. There is a bit of gathering as we get into very small groups of just one or two people. Some people are going off on their own. At the bottom of the hill is some kind of night vision glass that if you look through it, you can see where the red marks are. You can’t see the marks unless you’re looking through the glass. So, you have to remember where they are then start to weave your way up the hill and climb over the rocks, sometimes on hands and knees. Some of it is really steep and people are grabbing onto immature trees to help pull themselves up. We don’t have any equipment. We’re wearing clothes and we have to figure out how to navigate through the landscape on our own. Then once you get there, you just feel around with your hand or look with your eyes to discern if there’s some item that’s not natural. Some of them are tricky. For example, one of the items is simply some food. So where the red dot was is a piece of fish food then close by to where it was found, the rock is like a mouth of a cave. We crawl in. Really close to the mouth of the cave is a deep, deep pool. There’s a large fish in there, probably about three feet long and has teeth. What’s the natural food you do with fish food if there’s a fish? Feed it. So, the person that I’m with feeds the fish. I think she better get her hand back quickly because that fish has a lot of rows of pointy teeth and it’s a carnivorous fish. She does. She feeds it. Then it submerges itself. Right after that, an even bigger fish starts swimming up to the surface. It’s about twelve feet long! We all start running out. It’s the mother. There was only one piece of food and we’re thinking that we might be the other food. Each one of these spots has hazards and the thing you’re supposed to solve. Some people are able to remember three red dots and they just keep moving back. Other people can only remember one at a time so they go back down to the bottom of the hill and look through the night vision glass again. One of these times when I go back down there Omar is there. We group together to do our scavenger hunt. We have to go quite far. It’s a lot farther out than some of the ones that are closeby. There is a long climb up a tree then you have to move from the tree onto a rock cliff face. We swing onto the rock. There’s a forest ranger lookout tower and we climb up it. He finds all this survival equipment - tiny packages of dehydrated food wrapped in plastic and shirts with long sleeves individually wrapped in plastic. They’re the kind of shirt that protects you from the sun. There are other things also wrapped in plastic. Because he got there first, he has this big box. Luckily I was there, too, because it’s really impossible to hold a box and climb back down to the night vision pane of glass. So he hands me the box, then climbs down, then I hand him the box and climb down. This is how we get down. Once we get down, he is tasked with needing to divide the contents of the box equally between all the participants of this scavenger hunt. While he’s doing this, I go and find more of the marks. When I come back, he’s finished the task. Apparently, it’s my job to disperse the packages he’s divided and give one to each person. For some reason, he’s written really, really tiny and the ink of the pen he was using is really blotchy and runs out sometimes. It’s really hard to read the names. I’m trying to guess some of them. I do. I have another pen and am writing on the top trying to fill in the blanks. It starts to get dark. There’s one more task to finish. I go up the hill to a grassy area. There’s a lawnmower. Those two things go together. What do you do with a lawnmower? You cut grass. Only it’s really tricky because the grass is growing on the side of a slope and it’s pretty much a vertical rise. That’s the only long grass. I’m trying to push the lawnmower up and then guide it back down so it doesn’t flip over and cut my feet with the blade. I do this. It’s dark. This man comes over and comments that I’ve done a good job. The other tricky part about doing this is that there are some plants - angel’s trumpet - growing on that slope. You wouldn’t cut that with your lawnmower. So I have to be careful to get the grass without damaging the angel's trumpet. I finish this and then leave the lawnmower. At this point, there’s some kind of alarm raised. Everybody is running. There is some chaos. I see someone I know. I run over to her and ask if she knows what’s going on. She’s not sure and says I should stay here. This is one of the flat spots, a plateau. Others are gathering here, too. I see Omar and realize I didn’t finish dispersing all the survival kits. I can feel the fear in people as we’re standing and waiting to see if we have eased the threat by finding the marks and solving the puzzles, doing what we need to do?

I didn’t even realize that he lived in the entire upstairs room with an entire upstairs living room and that there was a walk up to the attic just for a breath of fresh air on the roof. I was telling the person who showed me that it was just like this other place I had lived. I think it was supposed to be New York or San Francisco. At the house where we live, we were doing experiments and these elementary kids would come and get dropped off for therapy sessions.We were allowed to leave but yet we were in. One night I played the piano and then snuck out with someone to have a cigarette (something I haven’t had in years and years). Next, I’m still outside in the same dream smoking. I think I was supposed to be in New York or San Francisco. There are these big hills and big avenues and we were trying to find a place to sit outside and we saw the Polynesian parade going by.

I couldn’t even wear earrings when I was giving birth. People disperse in an unremarkable way. Later in the dream, some guys are building a carnival playset with pipes. You climb up the pipes, do some athletic exercises at the top, then go down the slide. They remove some of the stations on the top part so that it’s not quite as challenging and people can go up, stand and look out, then go down the slide. A strong burly guy climbs up.

One is a boy of 6 and the other is a girl who is slightly older. Both have blonde hair. We are at a river flowing from left to right and my son is swimming. Somehow I've already seen into the future and know that he is going to be swept downstream later. We go to bed that night and I am woken up to find that my son is drowning. I go and rescue him. This happens a second time and I am still able to save him. The third time,  however, he is swept downstream. I become the father and watch as he is carried off. My wife has jumped into the river after him and I rush down the bank to try to catch up. I jump into the river and swim out after them, but the flash flood is too powerful. I am almost swept away but am able to catch onto a tree that is growing in the water. The water rises in waves and I am tossed up and down barely able to hang onto the tree. I am thrust under water for longer periods of time and am not sure if I will be able to hold my breath. I have to let go of the tree and am propelled up into the air. I fall back into the water and the process repeats. When back up in the air, also possibly for the third time, I see a platform made of orange-yellow tiles in a 3x3 grid pattern. They appear brighter at the edges and almost virtual. A man stands on them and is either removing the tiles below me so that I fall through or is not helping to place them. Eventually I or him am able to place a tile down so that my fall is caught and I am out of the river. I wonder if this man is Jesus.   .....

We’re leaving the house for an errand. A family has moved into our apartment with us and has brought all their kitchen supplies including a large cast iron pan, a whole collection of knives, spatulas, spoons and other things. Before we left, I was making an egg on a pan with a non-stick surface. Whenever I stepped out of the kitchen, the mom came and moved my egg to the cast iron. I moved it back and she moved it again. It was really irritating and I wanted them out. I couldn’t imagine blending our households. So I left. We are dropping off her husband so he can pick up more things.

We’re in the auditorium that reminds me of my high school auditorium that I was in a lot for dances, plays and assembly every Friday or Monday morning. It’s an intimate venue because the auditorium is pretty small, so Dane Cook is pretty close. There are a bunch of other people in the auditorium; they are all men and I am the only woman. They’re all wearing plaids or flannels, all different colors, including Dane Cook. I'm sitting next to Josh and laughing because it is funny, it is a comedy show. It’s kind of short. He finishes his set and all the other guys in the audience go up on stage and swarm him. Everybody is very complimentary, telling him what a good job he’s done. I’m just sitting in the back wondering why everyone is in plaid flannels and why it’s all men, just a big sausage fest. The term “sausage fest” is the kind of thing Dane would say in his comedy. I’m a little confused as to why I’m the only female in the room. Dane gets off the stage because he’s finished with the set. He’s heading up to the sound booth. Josh calls him over to introduce him to me. It is an awkward moment for me because Dane Cook definitely takes the time to go out of his way and say hi. I wonder why he would come over to say hi. Josh says, “Well, because you’re gorgeous and he wants to talk with you.” I’m like, “Well, whatever!” I’m not impressed that a celebrity is wanting to talk with me - that sounds right in real life, too! The scene changes here. I don’t know if Josh is still with me. I’m watching a soccer game. It’s all the girls I played soccer with in high school on the junior varsity team and some of the varsity girls, too. They’re all wearing our uniforms from school. Every year the shorts were always the same black, but we had a slightly different t-shirt design that was always red. Red, Black and White were our school colors. There are some white pairs of shorts on the field, too. I’m watching the game and super bummed because I loved playing soccer and I’m not playing, I’m just sitting on the sidelines watching. I’m not sure who the team is that we’re playing against. It looks like one of the teams we used to play against in school. I’m wanting to play so bad. We’re outdoors at a soccer field and I’m actually sitting under a tree, it’s an older shorter tree that is growing sideways because the trade winds are blowing so strong that the tree grows in the direction that the wind is blowing to. I have this sad feeling in my chest even though I’m excited to watch the game because it is a good game. But I have this sad feeling in my chest because I’m not playing and I’m just watching everyone running on the soccer fields. I love soccer and I’m not invited to play and it’s been a really long time since I’ve played so I would not be really good nor do I have the cardio for it. I just have this longing and nostalgia for it. Then the game finishes. All of a sudden there’s busy work that has to happen. I’m watching the field morph. I can’t tell where we are now, but all of a sudden everyone has a job to do. There are tasks that everyone is doing. Again, I’m not part of it and I’m just observing all of this. There is not a task for me. I see some of the soccer girls and I try to say hi to them, but they don’t recognize me. There is one girl who I grew up and she doesn’t recognize me. There’s my other friend Nani who I’ve known since second grade who recognizes me but she’s like, “I’m busy and I’ve gotta go.” She does sit with me for a little bit. While we’re sitting there, another girl comes up - I’m saying “girl” because everyone is a teenager - and she’s got a project she’s working on. I ask her to show me. There’s wire wrapped around a needle and she’s trying to pick up the wire with another needle; it looks like knitting. I ask her to show me. Her words to me are: “I can show you but I’m not trying to stay here longer than I need to.” It’s like she’s almost off work with the job she’s doing, although she is in a soccer uniform and wearing cleats and everything. But she’s almost done. Her shift is almost done. Then I say, “Okay, awesome. Hear that. Show me what you’re doing because this is interesting to me. Then you can go.” She’s a local girl, so I can feel this air of “Ick, why do I have to indulge the haole girl?” That’s a weird current to all of a sudden show up in a dream.

It’s really cramped. Everything always seems rushed. I’m supposed to be hosting some kind of group discussion and I’ve been planning it for some time. There’s about twenty people involved and a certain day that it happens. In my dream, today is the day. I’m trying to use the washroom and get my clothes out, but there’s always someone else in there. I’m starting to feel rushed and I’m going to be late. I have this other book satchel that I brought on the trip and it had all the things I needed for the group discussion. It was all organized and I put it in there before the trip. There were pens I needed and a little tiny laptop and paper and a couple of other things that look like slim books, and they all fit in there nicely. I can’t find this. Someone has moved this. I’m looking for the people in the RV to ask them: “Who moved my thing? Where did you put it? I need it and have to go now.” Then it’s time to go and I can’t find it. So this lady named Maria says, “Here, I have a few pencils and a pad of paper you can use.” I notice that hers have her name on everything. Everything I’m using says Maria. I think that was a really good idea that she had. I thank her and exit out the RV. I go back behind it to a long building and I enter the building. There’s a big room like a studio room. People are already there and sitting and waiting. One of the people that signed up, before I can get to the place they’ve left empty for me, he sits down in it. I wonder what he’s doing. He opens this paperback book and starts reading these really cryptic sentences. I think, “What does that even mean? I can’t even recognize any part of that sentence as relating to the subject matter we’re gathered here for.” Now while I was happy to give him some time leading the group, because he was part of this group, I see everyone else is looking puzzled and it’s my responsibility to facilitate. I think I should redirect this somehow. So I quietly shuffle around the outside of the circle and come down on my hands and He holds up the cover and it’s some completely different book, completely different topic. So I say, “What are you doing?” He says, “Oh, well, I had something scheduled before this, but my group didn’t show up or they were late. So I thought I would just take this time to get my stuff in anyway,” I’m thinking to myself, “Well, I can’t really do anything about this without completely disrupting and if they’re listening, I”ll just walk away.” So I do. I leave him there to talk about whatever he was trying to talk about with my group. I get halfway back to the RV and three of the other group members have also left and run up behind me. They say, “What was that?” I say, “I don't know. He just usurped my group and is using it for his own purposes.” They say, “Well, we came to hear you, so we’re not going back,” and they leave. I get to the RV and open up the door. Maria is sitting at the driver’s seat. I tell her, “Thank you very much for your things. I didn’t need them. I really like the nametags. Where did you get them?” I tell her that Brad was taking over the group and say, “Isn’t he one of your students?” She says, “Yes, he is. He shouldn’t be doing that. I’m going to go see what’s happening.” She leaves the RV. I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream2

1381,1232,,24/09/2020,09/24/2020 00:04,"Snakes, so many snakes. I’m with a lot of people - I don’t recognize all of them, though a few are my siblings and some are my loved ones, but I’m not sure who. My kids are there, I think. I am in an outdoor area and we’re fleeing something. One of the things we’re feeling is snakes. There are snakes everywhere, literally popping up no matter where you turn there’s a snake there. Some are tiny garter snakes and some are those gigantic boa constrictors that you see in the rivers of South America, just huge. We’re in a forest. It’s a forested area, oak not pine trees. I’m getting this weird bird’s eye view of the area. It looks almost like a checkerboard, but each square is different - a couple squares are forest, a couple squares are a complex with metal and barbed wire, and some of the squares are mountains. It’s very segmented landscapes, but the snakes are everywhere. At one point, I’m watching people kill the snakes. I’m not killing them; I’m trying to move them to the side, at least the small ones, and just get out of the way of the big ones. I’m trying to keep the people who are with me - it must be my kids - close to me and out of harm's way, away from the snakes. Most of the snakes are not poisonous - there aren’t a lot of rattlers, but it’s freaky because there are so many snakes. I wake up a little bit, then go back to sleep. Now I’m in another dream. I have my son with me, but he’s little, six or so. We are in a treehouse that overlooks a river. It’s on one side of a bank and the bank is steep - this side is higher than the other side because I can see over the treetops on the other side of the river. There’s a view and it’s very expansive. I’m in the house, but am outdoors. It has an outdoor patio with a huge, deep koi pond. There is a spiral staircase at the center of this outdoor area. My son and I go to walk up the spiral staircase because we are wanting a better view. There are koi fish, seals, and sharks in the pond. The koi fish are vicous as fuck! I take two steps up the stairs and these big fat koi jump up out of the water, manage to make it through the railings of the stairs, and bite my legs. It hurts! Do koi fish have teeth? I don’t know. Then, the koi fish continues its path over the stairs, through the railings and ends up back in the pond. There are a few fish all in a row that do this, but only the first one bites me, because with the next two I’m like, “Ack, get out of the way!” Interestingly, the second koi fish that jumps has no tail - it has been through battles and no longer has a tail. I have no idea how it is still alive, but it is. My son is wanting to follow me up the stairs and I’m like, “Nope, we are not going up these stairs.” I grab him and we go back down the stairs. I’m trying to get him away from the water. I’m thinking this is not a lovely idyllic koi pond. There are terrifying animals in there. He gets really close to the edge and I follow him. This is when I see the seals and sharks in the water with these big koi fish. The koi are as big as the length of my entire arm and I couldn’t fit my hands around them if I wanted to. My son gets close and he lies down on his belly at the edge of this pond. I’m watching him because I don’t know what will come out. This huge seal comes out and lays next to him. I’m watching the seal and make eye contact with the seal. I get the sense that there is some very vast intelligence in this seal. Despite this, I’m still very concerned for my son’s life. He’s trying to slide into the water. I grab him, back away and give the seal some space. The seal is also gigantic. My sense is that we’re not going to be playing in the water today.",Rose,last_nights_dream
1382,1453,,24/09/2020,09/24/2020 00:05,"“Snakes” I’m sitting in some kind of classroom. The desks are in rows. I’m sitting in a row, second desk from the front. There is no teacher in the room. The desk is empty. There’s nothing written on the board. The classroom door is open. I can see out into the hallway. Perpendicular to the open door is a long table and it has two women sitting at it. They’re busy writing things. I know that they are receptionists. There’s a little bit of a ripple of whispering that goes through the classroom. It sounds the way people would whisper when they’re alarmed - the uplifting and more staccato notes of the voices. I hear the word, “snakes.” All of a sudden I realize they must be talking about the two boa constrictors that are normally lazing around in the large tanks at the back of the room behind me in the back row. Without turning around to look to see if they are actually missing, I get up and start looking on the floor. I’m walking really slowly, so as not to alarm the snakes because they’re normally just lie there and not bother anyone as they rarely eat and they sleep a lot. I don’t see any lying around the perimeter of the classroom. I look out to where the desks are and where the secretaries are sitting. I see the really long one, it’s longer than the length of the table they’re seated at. It’s snuggled itself up against the baseboard. I’m thinking that if I just quietly go up to their desk and tell them not to be alarmed but they should move slowly and quietly then we can get the snake and return it to its home and this will be fine. Also I didn’t tell anybody else in the classroom because I don’t want a whole bunch of noise and people running around making a whole bunch of vibrations and stampede sounds on the floor. That would also alarm the snake. I just quietly get up and wander slowly towards the door. All of a sudden there’s this big alarm voice. People are yelling, “Snake!!!” at the top of their lungs. They’re climbing over each other and on top of the desks and are trying to get out. By this time, I’m standing right in front of the secretaries’ table. The secretaries leap out of their chairs and run the opposite direction. I see that the snake has rolled out so it’s halfway underneath the secretaries’ table now. But I’m still not alarmed. I turn around to go back into the classroom. I haven’t decided what to do. But I’m thinking there’s a handler’s fork at the back of the classroom by the cages. It’s got a six-foot long handle and a “U” on the top of it, and you can just pick the snake up with it and guide it back to its home. Normally the snakes will tolerate this. So I’m walking calmly towards the back of the room and I just turn around to make sure the snake is still under the table, and it’s not! It has accordioned itself up, so now instead of it having an eight-foot long body, it has a two-foot long body tightly coiled like a spring that’s loaded. I think that’s weird because constrictors don’t normally do that. In a split second, it has released the spring and I feel it hit my back and it’s biting right at the back of my heart. It has teeth now. The teeth won’t let go of me. I arch my back trying to break it’s grip. It doesn’t. I start shaking my upper body and arching and twisting my spine, trying to dislodge its teeth, and it does. It goes back down to the floor and now I’m running, getting up on the desks, still trying to get the fork so i can use it to defend myself. I’m hoping it’s not going to reload itself into that spring and lunge at me again.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream1
1383,1454,,24/09/2020,09/24/2020 00:06,"“Old School” I’m both in the place when it existed in its own time and again later as some kind of impermanent guest. In the dream, when it starts, I’m living there. Then it’s almost like the time I spent actually living there is a memory I’m unaware of as I re-enter it. The setting is a cleared area in a forest. The structures are really rustic; they’ve been hand-hewn and erected without machines. Everything has been done by hand. In fact, the floor inside one of the structures, the one I’m in, is made of gravel and wood chips and it’s quite chunky. I’m inside one of these structures in the village and looking out the window. I look at the other structures from the window and think, “Hmm, that’s interesting. When they resurrected this, they put them in a different spot than they originally were.” I notice that the windows aren’t made of glass, but something a little opaque. I’m not quite sure what the material is. I’m inside one of these and it’s definitely the biggest of the structures and has two floors. I don’t go to the upper floor. I’m sitting on something and it’s not really a couch - it’s something stuffed with straw or horse hair. I’ve got a binder with me. I take it out and it’s study notes. I realize that I should have looked at these earlier because I actually have a lesson plan that’s due today. I'm not worried though. I think. “Ah, that’s fine. I just have to sit here and sit still and do it.” So I start to read through the instructions and I hear some people talking in one of the other rooms. I stand up and walk over the rough floor and sure enough there are two other people. I’m wearing headphones at this point. One of the men is telling a story to the other man sitting there about how he got one of his jobs and a job he was quite happy with. He had been called in to fill in for someone else. He had some kind of project and no one had ever seen this kind of projector before. It put all of the work he needed to teach up on a whiteboard and it was really easy, it was compact, it was able to stream a whole bunch of different things into one machine. The way he told the story, people were marveling at it, asking him where he got it, etc. He had picked it up from somewhere exotic. They had called him in to do this kind of work in this school on a regular basis and they hadn’t hired anyone for years and years and years apparently, according to him. What he didn't realize is that my headphones were picking up the entire conversation he was having with his friend. His friend realized this and said, “I see we have someone else on the line.” He said, “Yeah, that’s just Lynn.” I’m thinking, “Well, they’re right, my headphones are picking it up, but I’m not Lynn.” Then I try to reach around to my ears and see if I can find some buttons that would turn off their conversation, although it had been interesting. I actually want quiet so I can do my own work. I leave the area where they had been making contact with each other. I realize as I was leaving that they weren’t even there and the whole thing was a hologram. I go back to my binder and sit on the stuffed cushion. I hear someone coming down the stairs from the upper floor. It’s a woman. I tell her that I’m going to do these lesson plans here. She just acknowledges that and drifts off. I don’t see her again. As I’m looking through the lesson plan, someone from my headphones asks me what I want to teach when I finish my program. I don’t know who it is - it’s like a disembodied voice. I say, “Well, I’ve worked with kids before and I really don’t think I want to put that much physical energy into my day, plus they get sick a lot. I really want to be in an environment where there’s not so much illness. Middle school, eh, that’s a lot of work, too, but in a different way. Maybe?” I realize that as I’m telling this, I want to teach high school because the environment is generally cleaner in terms of illness. You don’t need as much equipment because the kids don’t need to be entertained. I’m thinking that if I had the same technology that I overheard the man talking about in the other room, then the high school kids would be engaged and it’s really quite compact and doesn’t take up much space. I put this to voice and say, “You know, I think I want to teach high school kids.”",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream2

He steps away and rinses it out with water. He returns and shows me the inside of the pot. There is still a bit of watered down tea in the bottom of the teapot. The top is missing. He just pours the water on the table. The mother who is sitting next to me is shocked. She says, “You just poured water all over the table and it’s getting these contracts wet!” She is upset. But my husband doesn’t understand why she’s upset. I’m a little surprised but just get cloth napkins and wipe up the water. The pizza is served to us. It looks pretty good, but I note that the toppings aren’t quite right or evenly distributed. One piece has a huge pile of caramelized onions and the onions are red not white. The next piece has hardly any onions, but more cream sauce. Then I notice that someone has eaten the crust of one of the pieces and only the first bite is remaining - it is my favorite bite, but I find it odd - this piece is wedged between the whole pieces. I eat it and wonder if I was the one who ate the other part of the pizza and just forgot? It does smell and taste good, though.",Ana,last_nights_dream1

She is well put together and wearing a royal blue pantsuit. She’s upset. I talk to her about the psychic healing system I work with. She asks me a question about it then walks a little away. I am not facing her but can see her as if I’m looking through a rearview mirror. She turns and walks back to me and asks more questions. She wants to know if it’s possible to do a healing for herself. Then she asks if I can do a healing for her team. I say yes because she is a representative of her team. Then she asks if I can do a healing for her husband and his team. I think that if they’re all in the same company and connected, then I could probably do that. Slowly it comes out that she has missed an important deadline for work for applying for a grant. She’s really upset about this missed opportunity. She works with exotic wildlife, particularly exotic cats. I become lucid in the dream and rise up partially out of it. I realize I have just missed by a few hours an opportunity to apply for a business grant for COVID relief. My mind starts ticking away trying to figure out how to apply anyway and ask for an extension. I hope I can write and ask for the deadline extension because I have a toddler at home that I’m taking care of nearly full time.",Ana,last_nights_dream2
1399,934,,26/09/2020,09/26/2020 00:04,"I’m in a conference center. I’ve happened upon a group of people. They all look like they work with nature conservation in some way - forestry, seed saving, permaculture, climate change, soil, etc. I’m really interested in what’s happening here. I just sort of add myself to the group. This is the first day of their meeting. Everyone circles up and they all have name tags except me. The guide notices I don’t have a name tag and she asks if I registered for the day. I tell her no and I didn’t know about this until I just happened upon it, but I feel like I really need to be here. She stops for a bit and thinks about what I’ve said then says, “Okay, come with me.” Everyone breaks for gathering their things and getting ready for the day of being on the land and learning about the seeds, roots, berries, flowers and their conservation as well as their medicinal uses. I’m walking with the guide. She is a young woman with long blond hair. She has grown up in relationship with the land. We are at Esalen - my dream form of Esalen. We need to get permission from the front office so that I can be here, even though I’m not planning to stay overnight. They still need to register me for the course. We’re looking, but can’t find anyone with authority. We stop at her trailer so she can get a certificate and papers for me. The trailer is really interesting. I recognize it as somewhere I’ve been before, even though I haven’t in waking life. The trailer is reserved for visiting faculty. Before the closets were full of Burning Man style costume clothes that the teachers could wear around the campus. Another wall is lined with narrow shelves filled with small cylindrical bottles of herbs of all colors. There’s another set of wider shelves in the corner by the bed with books. It’s a sweet and comfortable place. I notice that the clothes have been traded out for doll-sized clothes, so it’s more for decoration than use. It’s a new COVID policy shift, so it still has the old flavor of how things used to be, but now the clothes can’t actually be worn. She gets what she needs and fills her bag for the day of teaching on the land. We leave. We pass through a dining area. They are just now putting out lunch. She suggests we stay for lunch. It’s a spread of delicious mini sliders - hamburgers and hot dogs with gourmet toppings, and caprese vegetarian ones. It all looks so beautiful and delicious. I surreptitiously reach for one and eat it, trying to look like I’m not actually chewing because I’m not registered and I’m not really supposed to be here. She is sitting at a table with colleagues and I go back for more because it’s so tasty! I want to try at least one of everything. I see my friend Mo from graduate school. I’m happily surprised to see him. He looks a bit sad. He tells me he’s been spending more time in San Francisco. I think that’s interesting because he lives in the East Bay. He says he’s been in SF more because he and his wife aren’t really doing well right now. He was married four or more years after me. I tell him he’ll be fine and his marriage will be okay because there are phases in a marriage when you don’t feel super connected, but you’ll come out of it and appreciate each other again. He’s hopeful but a bit weary to put his hope in my words. I look around and see that my guide has left. I tell him I have to go and hope to see him around later. I am looking for the group again. I’m in the huge conference center with many floors. There are start-up companies in meeting, people working on computers, miniature libraries with specialized topics for research. I’m wandering around and feeling lost. I find a woman sitting behind a glass - it looks like an information desk. I ask her about the group I’m looking for. She says, “I’m more in charge of the people who rent space here for months and years rather than day visits.” She comes out from behind the glass and we go down the elevator. We get to an area that she says is their meeting space. It’s not at all familiar. I look way down and think I recognize some of the people. I really want to find them because I really want to go on this learning trek and know this is important knowledge to gather. She leaves me there and I’m trying to find my way down to the people. I feel at a complete loss and I’m lost.",Ana,last_nights_dream3

I scale the outside of the wall and get to the top. The safe is built into the inside of the stone wall. I use a powerful magnet on the wall to open the safe. I clamber through a window and retrieve the object within the safe. It is a solid metal rectangle about 3x3x5 inches. It's silver and has a rim that extends around one side. It's corners are rounded but it is more square than oval.   I slip it into my right pocket and make my way downstairs. Before I cross the room I hear voices from outside. It is the villain.

I had my phone in my hand so I pick it up before the first ring is over. I know it’s him even though he’s changed his number, it still pops up as his name. I’m surprised because he had given up his phone. Even though it’s not a video call, I can see him. He’s sitting on an oversized chair. He’s very awkward. He says, “Hey, it’s Jeremy.” I say, “I know. Hi, how are you?” I’m trying to be light. Then he says, “I owe you an explanation.” So then he starts to share. I can’t really hear what he’s saying and then the dream dissolves into nothing. Before this, I’m riding in a wooden wagon with other people over farmland. It had been raining up higher on the hill, but as we are taking the wagon down, I get out and start running. It’s urgent. I’m running through snow. It’s the first snowfall. I go inside. There are other people waiting. I wade into a warm indoor pool. We’re talking about something that happened earlier and two women who've gone missing. As we are talking and wading, the water drains completely. It’s a big pool and I’m surprised that the water has gone out entirely. I wonder if they do this every night to keep the water clean. But because the temperature of the water and air are exactly the same, I didn’t notice that the water has been draining until it’s completely gone. Then we walk up the steps out of the pool. Before that, I’m at dinner. It’s quite loud. I was going to finish teaching a lesson on the element of fire, but we have to delay the lesson because one of the women is planning to call in and will be on video. I don’t think it’s appropriate to have a video call and a loud voice in the restaurant. The dinner breaks up and everyone leaves. There is a sinister feeling and things are not quite right. One of the men leaves with a woman and another woman leaves by herself. The woman who leaves by herself walks into a swamp in her clothes until she is completely submerged. She dips her head under overgrown reeds and grasses and chooses to drown herself. I see an image of her with white milky eyes open and dead, like a dead frog. The man who left with the other woman takes her to another marsh. He makes love to her then drowns her, too. He lifts her out of the water and is caressing and kissing her even though she is dead. Then he submerges her into the water again and tucks her under the marsh. Again, I see the milky white eyes.",Ana,last_nights_dream
1413,1235,,27/09/2020,09/27/2020 00:06,"I am walking through an outdoor market. There are shops, too. I am with friends - we met up at a cafe. The cafe is owned by a friend, a woman, though not somebody I recognize in waking life. I am sort of wandering and stopping to talk with people. I walk through the cafe because I’m meeting people there. Then I go to leave the cafe and get my shoes. I walk through this door and bend down to grab my slippers. There are four pairs of slippers. One of my friends who I’m there to meet - this friend is switching between my friend Beth and a classmate from high school - her face keeps changing. As I bend down to pick up my slippers, she slams the door open onto my head. I don’t know if she did it on purpose or not. My reaction is that she did it on purpose, because I stand up and slam the door back on her. I’m pissed that she has hurt me like this because it was so unexpected and triggered my trauma response which is, “if you hit me, I’m going to hit you back harder.” I do it. Then I’m like, “Oh god!” I still can’t tell whether she did it on purpose or not because she’s very shocked that I slammed the door back on her. But she also has a malicious look in her eye like she got me to do what she wanted me to do, which was to hurt her. Then she goes and tells everyone that I just slammed the door on her. I’m feeling all kinds of shame about it. I walk back into the cafe with the owner who is my friend in the dream realm. I’m trying to explain myself, but I can just feel that I should not have slammed the door on her and hurt her like that. Any words coming out of my mouth sound like a terrible excuse. The cafe itself is very bright and airy. There is a lot of white, lots of big windows. Everyone is hustling and bustling and all the servers are pretty quick. You can hear the clink of glasses and china. There are pastries coming out and coffee being served. So the space itself is pretty bright, but me coming in to say I just did this thing feels very shadowy in comparison. Then the dream switches. I’m with Jamie, another pole dancer instructor and her students. We are all trying to do some pole, but there’s no pole. We order a pole online and it arrives. I go to set it up and it’s way too skinny - it looks like a coat rack. I’m trying to put it together but there are all these hooks coming out of it and I’m thinking there’s no way anyone could pole on this thing, plus it’s too skinny and it’s too short! It’s about my height, so it wouldn’t even work as a free-standing pole. I walk into the studio and say, “Jamie, here’s the pole, I don’t know if it is going to work!” She’s like, “Don’t worry about it, I got it!” I look and see three regular poles at the far end of the studio for everyone to use. I’m excited because now I can actually pole. There are only three of them, but I figure we can all take turns. I leave that pole on the side and stop fussing with it. Then the dream transitions. I leave the pole studio and go to the beach. I’m with some people who I don’t know or who are acquaintances. I’m with Josh and a little one - I think it’s his little one that he’s watching. I’m talking to these other people I’m at the beach with. It’s a woman and a little girl. I think she is the little girl’s mother. The little girl is in the back of a pickup truck parked under an easy-up, so there’s shade. I look at the little girl and she has a swimsuit on and is wrapped in a towel. Her skin is really red. I see that she has a really bad sunburn. The mom is wanting to take her back into the ocean, but I tell her not to take her out of the shade because she has a really bad sunburn. The mom unwraps the towel and starts to pull the girl’s swimsuit off. The girl is maybe 6 or 7. Her unburnt skin is the palest white with freckles. Her burnt skin is like third degree burns. I’m horrified and looking at the mother like, “Did you not put sunscreen on her or anything? You have to take her to the hospital, that’s how burnt she is.” I’m horrified by it and trying to see if I have anything to put on this child’s skin but I don’t. The mother does take her to the hospital. Then I turn and look towards the ocean and Josh is running with his little one down the beach. They are having a good time. But I’m trying to see if there is sunscreen on both of them. I’m really worried that everyone is going to be burnt. Then the dream shifts again. I’m trying to find a home that’s not in America. I’m looking at different landscapes and it’s like I can teleport myself to these different landscapes and get a feel of them. One looks very much like pictures I’ve seen of Switzerland. We go through a desert, too. I think Josh is with me. I end up at this table in a home and Helen is there. It’s Helen’s class of priestesses, or whatever it is she’s teaching now. I’m like, “Oh my god, I haven’t seen you in forever. What are you doing in my dream? Where are we?” It’s a long table and there are a bunch of people, though not all female bodied priestesses. Josh is with me and I’m like, “Josh, you need to listen to what she says but listen really critically.” I know that I’m telling myself this, too. I’m following along with everything she's saying, though I’m not having a conversation because she is talking and teaching. While she’s talking, I’m listening and thinking, “Wow, she is still in denial about the sickness of whiteness and colonialism and patriarchy and privilege. She is spiritually bypassing still and setting her up as a guru.” These are my lucid thoughts as I listen to her talk. In the dream, her speech was very particular and I cannot remember it which is a bummer because I sense there was some information I really needed. Eventually we are at dinner and Josh and I leave the dinner. I’m like, “No this is not the place for me either. I just need to leave.”",Rose,last_nights_dream
1414,1456,,27/09/2020,09/27/2020 00:07,"“Mis-Match” I’m at some kind of outdoor gathering. There are two fields and a little bit of a marker that separates one field from the other. In one of the fields people are just enjoying themselves, random socializing and conversations. In the other one, there is a big table. We have to match five bundles to five names and there is a keycode that goes with it. This has to be done before you can freely join in any of the other games. I was in the social field and then in some way I was alerted or warned that I had to go match these bundles with the keycode. So, I leave. I walk up the field to the table. The little bundles are almost like medicine bundles. They’re pieces of cloth tied with bits of leather. Some of the leather has beads on the end. In addition to the leather tie is a small tag. The keycode is really worn. It’s like a piece of canvas with lists on it. The lists are so worn that they’re really hard to read. I’ve got five of these little medicine bundles. Each one belongs to somebody that’s there. I have to find the name on the keycode, then transfer the keycode onto the little bundle’s tag. The first thing is that the marker doesn’t work on the tag. It seems to work for others, but it’s not working for me. It takes a little figuring and decoding because they aren’t just regular names, there are numbers. You have to translate the numbers, do some math in your head, look on the canvas, count some things, then calculator in your name, then translate this back onto the tag. So, because my marker doesn’t work, I keep forgetting all the calculations in my mind. I am getting really frustrated because it’s not working. Everybody else is going up, finishing tagging and coding their bundles, then going back to the games. So I’m still there. Other people come in. Someone takes the marker. I have to wait and can’t find the canvas legend. The marker doesn’t work. Then everyone is finished except for me and I’m still sitting there. A woman named pauses for a moment from having fun and tries to help then just disappears. I look and see all the people that were in my social group but are now no longer in the bottom field and have left and gone on to do something else. I do eventually finish. The reason I finish is because I just wrote with the marker that didn’t work. I put it on there even though I knew it probably couldn’t be seen by anyone, then left the table and walked back down. But by this time everyone else has gone. When I get back to the bottom field, someone tells me that the older group of people I was hanging out with have moved beyond that field to a different area. I start to go look for them. It’s harder to see where people are here, which is why it’s for more experienced people. It’s forested or something. It’s hilly. The terrain is more rough. I don’t find who I was looking for. I’m kind of absorbed by this other group that’s traveling. They’ve got a handicapped person in their midst; it’s like they have hemophilia and can't be jostled around or bumped. There’s a special diet that goes with this young boy. He has parents in the group. The parents are being irresponsible with how they divide the resources. Each group has five people in it and these five people are supposed to accomplish something. But they’re giving all their resources to the son and not to any of the other people in the group. I can see that there is in fact plenty to go around. Some of the things they’re giving him, he doesn’t even need and they’re not necessarily good for him given his condition. So this starts to frustrate me, as well. Where we’re sitting is dark. They’re at a wood table. I’m not even sitting at it. I’m sitting at the one behind, and I’m supposed to be sitting with them. I get frustrated with this unfair allocation of resources. I’ve tried to negotiate with them, but they keep ignoring me until finally I release some of this frustration with a verbal blast. But that doesn’t do anything either. They just look at me, pause for a moment and go back to what they were doing.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I have to take him upstairs. Then I get in my own car and leave. At some point, I see a silver french bulldog that I used to own in dreamtime, but rehomed it. I keep thinking about getting a dog, but we had a dog once and we rehomed him because he was the neediest dog ever and competing with my daughter for my attention, but the whole point of getting this dog was so that he and my daughter could bond. So I rehomed him. I used to have this french bulldog in the dream, but was like, “Oh, I got rid of it.”",Mary,last_nights_dream

It is in the time of coronavirus because everyone has to wear masks. There are people I recognize - a guy I used to work with from the grocery store and a few others. We are all getting some kind of training. There’s a woman who puts off some sketchy evil vibes. She is talking with us. We are doing some sort of evaluation but also trained or taught about how to use our superpowers. She’s like, “For all of us to do what we need to do, there are certain boundaries or lines that will be crossed.” I’m thinking, “I don’t think I signed up to be a bad guy.” I’m listening to her talk. She has a little pet animal in her lap. We’re all sitting at a long, tired dining room table. She’s down below me and there’s maybe eight or twelve students on either side of her down below. I’m on the other side of the table which is higher than hers. I’m looking down and watching. There are maybe only four or five of us on this side of the table. This little pet in her lap looks like Stitch from “Lilo and Stitch.” She’s talking to it and petting it while she’s talking to us. I get the sense that it has special powers and it is evaluating us and telling her in her ear which one of us will be good candidates for something. I watch her get up and walk around the table with it. It tells her specific things. It points at an Arab student next to me and shakes its head no. She looks at him and tells him to leave because I guess he doesn’t have the power that he needs to have to do the things she wants us to do. So he grabs his extra masks. He had tried to hand me a mask earlier like I didn’t have one, but I said, “Thanks for the extra one, but I am actually wearing one right now.” He leaves. She holds the animal near me. In my head or somebody drops this knowledge that the animal tells her we each can have an animal and it corresponds to an emotional superpower. I suddenly understand that this meeting was about who was going to end up with one of those animals, like what she has. She moves on. I stand up and follow her into the kitchen. She’s moving as if she’s very busy and has to move onto the next task. The kitchen is also an office and there’s a huge fish tank. She is already giving instructions to someone else. I come up to her and say, “There’s one of those things that you guys can create for me.” She stops talking and has a grin on her face and is like, “Well actually, you my dear, have enough power for three of these.” I’m a little taken aback and surprised. This woman has dark hair and reminds me a little bit of Helen but she’s not. They correlate to emotional superpowers, one is my ability to laugh and smile - at some point this thing smiled at me with all its sharp pointy teeth. She says, “Yes, and you have two others.” There's something about shadow and something about fighting, warrior spirit. We all pile into cars and drive somewhere.

So I’m forced to go out, feeling vulnerable, unprepared, and setting myself up for ridicule. I go out onto the floor in my pajamas with my apron on, hoping no one will notice. The manager does and I explain what happened. He sends me out onto the floor anyway. Instead of the section I thought I was supposed to have, I’m in another one that’s called the “Bad Lot.” It’s called the “Bad Lot” because no one wants to sit there until the restaurant is all full, and then it just gets slammed. Instead of the five tables that are supposed to be in the “Bad Lot,” there are sixteen! They’re all over the place and they’re all seated at the same time. The pen won’t work. I can’t write down anyone’s orders. All the blank pieces of paper I had now have writing all over them. People are glaring at me; they’re yelling at me.

There was a lot of dream before this, but this is the only part of the dream I can remember. I don’t know why I’m there, I’m just there. My mom is there and I’m not entirely comfortable. She’s a younger version of herself - she’s in her forties, I think. I’m my age. I’m in a part of the room with a bed. I’m sitting on the bed and looking out the window. I can see this gigantic rat; it’s the size of a racoon. Or maybe it’s a koala. It’s like a cross between all three of those animals. It’s flying from some trees to a spot outside of the house where there is a hole big enough for it to get into. It gets in and crawls into a box across the room from me. I’m horrified and grossed out because this thing is really big and freaking me out with its long teeth. I’m not sure why it’s in the house. It’s like when you find a mouse in your house and it’s not your favorite thing in the world to see that you’re sharing space with the rodents. But this rodent thing is huge. I have this general sense of frustration. I’m mad that I’m there. I don't want to be spending time with my mom or be in the same space as her. She’s not in the room with me now though and not interacting. I’m just generally upset. Then she does come into the room. She’s pointing out to me some books that she’s read. I’m looking at the books on this dusty-ass bookshelf. The inside of the house is dark and reminds me of an old haunted house, like a Victorian era style with rugs and chandeliers. It’s darker inside and very dim lighting. These books are written by Loreena McKennitt. This is hilarious because Loreena McKennitt is actually a Canadian singer of Cetlic songs. But in my dream, she has written all these books and my mom is like, “Oh yeah, I remember reading all of these.” I’m looking at all of them and am like, “Did I read these?” I would be surprised if I didn’t read these because I read almost everything that was fantasy fiction fairy, whatever, and that’s what definitely these books are about. On the front of the books is art deco artwork of fairies and goddesses and fantasy genre. There is a whole series. I think I’ve read these and I think if I started reading them, I would remember what they’re all about. My curiosity is quite peaked. I want to read them. Then my mom goes and gets clothes out of a dryer. But it’s not clothes, it’s lame tablecloths, which is funny because in real life, her event planning side of her business she had tons and tons of lame tablecloths for the tables when she would set up parties. So she’s folding these tablecloths and kind of doing mom things around me. She’s also showing me clothes that she’s sewn. Or maybe she’s wearing them? I look down and see a little girl and it’s my daughter but also me but also my mom, all three of us together. She’s wearing a skirt I made and an old thrifted Christmas sweater and another jacket over it. Her entire outfit is so cute. It’s funky, the colors match’ish because the skirt I made is black, white and red taffeta plaid with black velvet vines over the top of it. The sweater is like an ugly Christmas sweater you’d find at a thrift store, but it looks so cute on her. Then she has this red velvet coat over the top. She’s maybe five. She’s super cute and I can’t believe how cute she is with her outfit and how she’s acting. I’m wanting to love on her. But she’s kind of standoffish and not wanting to interact with me. Then I look out the window and see that rat thing. I think I had gotten rid of it. It takes a flying leap back to the house and comes in through its hole. It creeps down the bookcase. I’m watching it and am like, “Ew, go away!” I’m looking at my mom and she’s like shrugging her shoulders like this thing just kind of lives here. I’m like, “But it’s a huge whatever! It’s pooping all over the place. It smells and it steals stuff and makes trash. And it’s freaky looking!” But then as it creeps closer to me, it morphs into a koala and looks kind of cute. It’s acting like a dog where it wants to be accepted. It comes really close to me, then drops to the floor and rolls over on its belly like it wants me to pet it. I’m like, “Oh hell no, I’m not petting you.” Then it rolls back over and climbs up to its perch. I’m like, “Gross, but whatever, it’s not my house.” Then my attention goes back to my mom because she’s still folding the tablecloths. She has shown me the books and now we are having a conversation and talking about the outfit of the cute little girl who has now disappeared. Now I notice that my mom only has one arm! I’m like, “How are you folding those tablecloths and when did you lose an arm?” It’s just a stub at the shoulder joint. We are sitting on the floor, leaning against the bookshelf and I’m asking where her arm went. She’s like, “Don’t you remember?” And I don’t. At this point, it becomes less my mom and a completely different character I don’t even know. She’s talking about all the kids she had and like, “Remember when your brothers did this and this and this? I had my arm then.” I’m like, “Yeah, but when did you lose your arm?” So bizarre.",Rose,last_nights_dream

The first two snakes are also anacondas - a lot larger than I first thought. There are also so many bathing snakes writhing around like earthworms, but they’re actually itty bitty baby snakes. I’m trying to cut them with a shovel. I can squash them with my shoes because I’m wearing flip flops and those won’t do. I’m looking for help and now realize that the snakes are a problem all over the island. I’m now at a hotel looking for more snakes and help. It’s late. I see Ted. We sit on a curb away from everyone else and have a talk before returning to our separate hotel rooms for the night.",Ana,last_nights_dream2
1453,1238,,01/10/2020,10/01/2020 00:08,"My dream was like a full on sci-fi movie starring Ryan Renolds. It starts out with us in outer space and there are aliens who are trying to bomb the earth or blow up the entire universe. The drama is high. Everyone is in panic and fight or flight mode. I think I’m on a ship. We’re trying to figure out how to stop the aliens. Ryan Renolds is trying to come up with a plan. There are a ton of people and I don’t know any of them. They are the movie extras. I don’t think I see the aliens, I just see their ships through a spaceship window. The plan includes getting ahold of these two units that will blow something up - very typical movie bullshit. I’m on the ship. There are a couple ships in the fleet. All of the ships fly at superspeed. They’re flying through the planets in our solar system, so we’re whizzing by Mars and Venus, then you see Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune. I think the goal is to get to Jupiter or Saturn and blow up one of them. So, this is the scene. Then just like in the movies, the movie cuts away to Earth because we’re all trying to save Earth. The sky on Earth is a blood red - it looks like how the sky looked when all the smoke was around. I’m on the street suddenly and Ryan Renolds is with me. I don’t know if I’m actually interacting with him or not. It’s almost like I’m silently following him at first. I guess I’m the girlfriend character in the movie and he’s talking with me. We’re on the streets of Earth and I look up and see the sky is red. I keep seeing all these white parachutes falling - it’s the people who were on the spaceships. They’re coming home so they can say goodbye to their loved ones. They’re all ejecting out of space and coming down to Earth for one last goodbye to all the people they love. In the meantime, Ryan is still trying to figure out how to stop the aliens. They’re trying to find the hole in their plans or where their weak spot is. There’s a scene with the parachutes falling and I’m listening to him talk and figure something out. Then the scene cuts away to what looks like Mission Control. There’s a woman reading a screen monitor. At one point, I remember seeing Ryan type into this computer: “Happy Birthday!” When he does that, all the aliens who were of one hive mind, suddenly say, “It’s my birthday, it’s my birthday! Happy birthday to me! No, it’s my birthday!” And this is just filling up the screen with all the aliens all talking to each other. Also, this woman at Mission Control whose computer this is realizes that all of the aliens look like humans and have been on Earth this whole time and now all of a sudden they’re fragmenting out into individuals because Ryan typed this one thing into the computer. She’s sitting back and laughing because she’s unlocked the key of whatever it is we need to know about them. Then, the scene goes back to me and Ryan. Now a lot of time has passed since he typed “Happy Birthday” into the computer. He and I are running through the streets of a city. The people speak English. Somebody is trying to catch him. I can’t tell if it’s these aliens disguised as humans or humans helping aliens or humans who are idiots. But there’s a cop looking person. The uniform is slightly different than a cop uniform. It’s almost like they have different rights as a cop - more rights. They are trying to catch Ryan. I’m a little further away from him now. I’m not sure why. The cop starts to beat him up with a billy club. There’s a bunch of other people with the cop who are also trying to beat him up. I’m pissed off. He’s fighting back. I run over there. They dropped him. He’s immobilized. They start to wrap him in a plastic sheet with a couple layers and then a blanket. I get to them and start swinging enough to clear the space. They back up away from me. I unwrap Ryan and his left shoulder is totally dislocated and looks terrible. I pop it back in for him. Then I pull him. We start to head off. I’m threatening these people the whole time like, “Fuck off. I will fuck you up.” The funny thing is when I was throwing the punches, it was very very unskilled and I couldn’t have hurt anybody, yet they backed away. So it’s kind of like they were just letting me do it. The lucid part of my mind is like, “You can’t fight for shit! You need to learn how to fight!” I go back into the dream and Ryan and I start running. The cop is yelling some bullshit at us as we go and I’m ignoring it, but part of me is wondering why they are letting us go because I wasn’t such a good fighter. And why did they just rough Ryan up and then let us run off? It doesn’t make any sense. Then Ryan realizes there’s one other thing he needs to do to help things. I don’t think a lot was accomplished. I still think Earth was going to be blown up or something.",Rose,last_nights_dream

Both finished a test but couldn't remember if it was on old or new material. It was on the old which was a relief. The college had new leadership which was more liberal. They had changed the course and made it easier and politically correct. We were waiting to find out the result of a vote being made by the board of directors who were under pressure to give more power to the new liberals. We were all against it and I think the college stood up to it.  Class began and William sat next to me. There was no room and I was almost pushed out of my seat. I had a pencil and notebook ready for class.  We started with a presentation from Mrs. Chin who taught music. She told us all about the instruments we could learn and had 3 of her sons sing and play drums. It was cheesy and uncomfortably loud.,Bob,last_nights_dream2

1458,1458,,02/10/2020,10/02/2020 00:01,"“Red Sand” I’m in the yoga studio that I teach in. One of the owners has offered to give me her two morning classes. I decide to attend one of them just to see how she teaches and to make the transition between her students and me as easy as possible for them. I’m surprised when I get there that the class is almost over because it was scheduled to start at 9:30am and it’s just a bit before 9:30 now. However, I walk in expecting the class to just be starting and it’s actually ending. She’s co-teaching with another person I’ve never seen. I think it’s significant that the person is brown and has an East Indian accent. The co-teacher is teaching yoga the way I’ve never seen it taught before in this area of Canada. It’s almost like a Jivamukti class where the teacher introduces a piece of philosophy and then teaches the class, only this is backwards where they’ve obviously already had their asana class and they’re sitting listening interestedly to the philosophy that the teacher is sharing. She describes tree pose as the opening of a door psychically. Her knee goes from flexion to extension and then she does the same thing with her hip, moving it from flexion to extension. She describes this as the movement of the psyche. Then she brings herself into ardha chandrasana and does the same thing with the lower arm, but it’s reaching out for a realm other than the one that we’re in. I think this is fascinating. So, I ask one of the people in the class who is an older lady with grey hair, she’s white, if the whole class was like this or if it’s just this period at the end. The woman turns around to answer me and I notice it’s a friend from my class in Grade 8. I’m surprised to see her. She says, “No, the whole class was like this.” I say, “Hmm, so this was your asana practice where you were mostly listening to stories and trying a few of the things she was saying?” She says, “Yes.” So I ask her, “Is this the same group of people, do all of you always attend this class?” She says, “Yes.” There are six people. I think, “Wow, this is amazing that six people continue to come and practice yoga in such an authentic and interesting way.” Then I say to her, “I have not seen you since Grade 8! Where have you been?” She says, “I live here and have lived here all of my life. I choose not to enter into the world, but I am content with what this very small town has to offer.” I chat with a couple more people in the class. They start to gather up their things and leave. Because I’m there really to get to know the people from the class, I don’t actually talk to the owner or the co-teacher. But I leave with the group that’s leaving. As I’m in the back of the studio, I put twelve tubes of something into my bag. They are mostly white tubes, and they have a band of bright colors around them. I don’t even know what they are. But I’m supposed to be collecting them, so I do. I exit the studio and one of the men from the class, Keith is met on the porch by three other male friends. They all have flutes. The flutes are all different. Two of the men have a wood flute. One of them has a metal flute. Keith’s flute looks like an obo, but it’s not. It has a heavier darker maybe ebony wood. It has keys you depress. I sit down on the porch but I feel like I asked him about his flute and he spent a minute or two explaining it to me. They start playing and it’s such beautiful music. You can tell they’ve played together for a really long time because they’re really tight together. They’re playing right underneath the window and I can see through the window that there’s some kind of staff meeting going on. I realize I’ve forgotten something. I go back into the studio...it has something to do with the twelve tubes in my bag. The other owner asks me about them. I have no recollection of what the conversation was, but I tell her I have them and she seems contented by this. She returns to her meeting and I go back outside. The flute music is almost over. Keith asks me if I listened to it. I say I did. He says, “Good, we’ve been working on this for a long time.” The music has something to do with what they’ve been practicing in the class. It’s almost like it’s a vibrational representation of their thoughts. I just feel so happy about this and so buoyant. Then he says, “I hope we can keep this going because this town is starting to get bigger. Come here, I want to show you something.” We walk for a block then turn right and go another block. Now we’re at the outskirts of town. He says, “Look what they’re going to put on this land.” He uses a stick to move some of the dirt around and he’s drawing a picture of a subdivision that has been planned to go there. As he’s doing this, I’m noticing that the sand is taking on a darker red color. I think, “Oh, I think there’s red clay under this.” I move the top three layers of sand off of it and there is! I say, “Look. There’s red sand underneath here.” He says, “No, it’s just spray painted. I say, “I don't think so, it looks real. It’s this color because of the high content of ferrous oxide.” He’s quiet and doesn’t say anything. He continues drawing the map and he’s adding onto it so it’s getting bigger and bigger and bigger. I’m thinking that they’re building on top of this red sand because the iron bleeds into everything it touches and maybe it will be okay regardless of what goes here because they will also absorb this deep deep deep red that is here.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

He and his whole family came down with the flu on two occasions. One of those was recent and must have been when I caught it from Jared.  I return home to self isolate but am around my dad a bit because he too is sick. I decide that it's safer if I am by myself because my dad may only have a cold. I speak with my brother about symptoms which so far are only a sore throat and headache. I don't notice any breathing difficulties yet and hope this is a good sign though I worry that they may develop.  I make arrangements to get a covid test and my mom drives me. I enter the building and they are prepared to do the test right away. They take blood and tell me that I will have my answer in 2 days. They explain to me that they are doing the fast version of the test which has a slightly higher false positive rate.   I return home and the next day my family and I decide to go watch a movie. I go wearing a mask but am feeling guilty about potentially exposing others to covid. I enter the building and see some seats in the handicapped row where we can socially distance. I'm unsure of whether we should sit there but William does.  I have to go out to the car for something and on my way out security needs confirmation of my name and ticket. I comply though I think it's silly. I return with whatever it was I was getting but I can't bring myself to risk infecting any more people so I wait by the car.  As I wait, I see a large grassy field fenced in on all sides and filled with cats. I approach it and sit down so that I can pit my hand through the wooden slats of the fence and pet the cats. They are all black and some of them are a bit nervous of me. I see several of them playing. One I find especially cute and wonder if I can adopt it. I wonder why the cats don't escape and peering over the fence find that I am at a dizzying height and that cement barriers prevent it. I turn away as I feel off balance.  On our ride back, I get an email as a piece of yellow paper in my wallet with my test results. They are early. When I finally am able to read them it says that the result is negative.

1463,1459,,03/10/2020,10/03/2020 00:03,"“Quest for a Job” I’m at the restaurant where I worked during university. I’m sitting at a booth across from the pizza oven with a friend. We’re not there for me to look for a job and I’m not working there. We’re just there because he’s hungry. He’s eating a salad. Overtop of the booth, I see one of the people I used to work with. He’s in uniform. I peak up over the booth. We make eye contact and say, “Hey. Wow, I haven’t seen you in so long.” I ask him, “Are you working here again?” He says, “Yes.” I say, “So they’re hiring again?” There’s been some kind of hiring freeze. He says, “Yes.” I wonder if they’ll rehire me because I really need a job. I look to see who the manager is. I’m looking around the floor from my seat and see that it’s George. He had stopped working there just shortly before I did. So I’m also surprised. Eventually he comes back to the pizza oven. We make eye contact and I wave to him and say, “Hey, when did you start working here again?” He says, “Not that long ago.” I say, “Would you take an application from me?” He says, “Here, I’m too busy to talk. Just follow me around for a little while.” So I do. We go back into the prep area and into the walk-in fridge. I’m trying to find out who the owner is and if it’s the same ones who bought it when we all left our jobs. He says, “It is the same ones, but…” and he doesn’t finish the rest of the sentence. I see a couple of other people I have not seen since high school and one who never worked at the restaurant, but he’s sitting there dressed in prep clothes. So, I’m waiting for George to finish the sentence and he goes into the dish pit. I follow him. I grab a few dishes because it’s really busy and I’m starting to help out. We go back into the area where we pick up the food plates. We go over to the bar. While he’s doing something there I put some dirty glasses into the dishwasher. I’m thinking, “Alright, I’m not even dressed for this but I’m doing all this stuff. This feels wrong.” I walk up to the hostess stand and there's a line-up. I’m like, alright, this is a bad idea. I’m not dressed for this. I’m not even wearing proper shoes. This isn’t safe. I walk back towards the table where my friend is still sitting and waiting for me. I explain that they’re hiring, but I’m trying to figure out how to put an application in. I say, “Maybe we should just go home. I’ll drop you off and then I’ll pick up a resumé from my house and come back.” Except it’s really late and I’m afraid that by the time I do that, the restaurant will be closed. So now I’m trying to ask George when the next time he’ll be here so I can bring a resumé back. He says, “Just wait.” I say, “okay,” and I just sit there at the table and wait. Eventually things slow down and he comes back over and says, “Alright, I’m not working again until Thursday.” I’m thinking to myself, “Hmm, he only has two shifts a week.” I say, “Well, I don’t really want to wait that long if they’re hiring because everybody wants a job. I would like to put my application in sooner rather than later.” He says, “Well there is another way of doing this. Follow me.” So we go out the side door through the closed patio and down towards the end of the mall. In reality there’s only one store between them and the end of the mall. But, in my dream, it turns into a dream I had previously where I was with the owner and somebody’s car was broken down (the dream is called the Diode) and we go down to the end of the mall. There’s this complex series of diodes store that we enter. I’m thinking in this dream, “Wow, this is the same store that I had in my dream!” I start to tell this to George: “You know what’s really weird? I had a dream that this store existed a few months ago even though it didn’t, and now it does!” He just looks at me and says, “Hmm, it’s always been here.” We enter the doorway of the electronics store. It’s the same kind of squirrel’s nest of all kinds of tightly packed boxes of switches and diodes. We go upstairs. There are two big doors made of wood at the top of the stairs and a small vestibule in front of it. I realize I don’t have my mask. I turn around and say this to George, but as I reach into my pocket, I feel it - it’s in there. I pull it out and say, “Nevermind, I do have it.” I continue going through the doors. Then I open one door and it’s a poolhall and I can smell cigarette smoke. I close the door quickly and turn around to George and say, “Are you sure? What are we doing here? It’s a poolhall and stinks of cigarettes.” He says, “No this is the right place. You can wait here if you want.” He goes in and goes all the way to the end of the room, gets something and comes out. He says, “Okay, here, this is it. You can fill this out instead of the application.” it’s folded in half lengthwise. But it’s this twenty-five page dossier that wants all kinds of information - banking records, genealogy of your family, and it’s crazy the amount of personal information they want. I look at him and say, “Are you sure?” He says, “Well, that’s the only other way of applying.” I say, “Why can’t you just take my resumé?” He says, “If you can go home and get it before close time, that’s fine.” So we walk back through the stripmall into the side of the building. I see another person who worked there when I did has already put in another application. I’m starting to feel anxious that I’m not going to make this window of opportunity. By the time I fill out this twenty-five page book, it’s all going to be gone. I thank him and leave. I drop my friend off and drive home. It’s pitch dark. I go upstairs, find a resumé, put it in a plastic sleeve and turn around to go back. But it’s already the next day. When I arrive, the restaurant is busy. I’m dressed better this time. I’m wearing the black jeans and the proper black shoes, but not the apron and shirt. I see there’s another manager on duty who I don’t know. I try to catch her eye but she’s busy, so I sit down at the bar and wait patiently. Eventually she comes back. I hand her my resumé and ask if it’s okay. She says, “Hmm, let me see it.” She looks at it and says, “You’re not quite the right person we were looking for.” I let her know I used to work here with all of the other people that have been recently rehired. She says, “Thank you, but no anyway.” I don’t know why but I start to feel really old, really depleted, really horrible. I wonder if I’m ever going to be able to get a job that’s enough to support my family.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

A patient came in in restraints like you see in the movies (not like we actually have) and he was sitting up in a chair and basically the chair had wood and he was strapped to the wood. He looked over at me with such vitriol but I could see he wasn’t really there and I wanted to take off the restraints. At the same time I felt he was dangerous (something I don’t often feel).

There is an extremely obese woman who we are trying to help downstairs. She’s so obese, she can’t walk. She’s also unable to talk, though her eyes are open and she is conscious. We have two ropes with heavy duty paper clips at the ends. The ropes are wrapped around her body. We swing one rope to the ceiling and it hooks up on the ceiling. The other rope is tied to the banister of the stairs. It’s a team effort. Two or three of us are trying to maneuver her down the stairs. We keep throwing the top rope to the ceiling, but then it hooks to places where it looks like it will pull the ceiling down. It’s like the ceiling is covered with a taut fabric and I’m concerned that the fabric will tear under her weight. We have to unhook the rope then hook it again. We get her down one flight of stairs and think we’re done. But then we look down and see more stairs. We are just at a loft area with a bed. I find myself attracted to the man who is helping, too. The other two helpers are women. While the others are resting on the loft and rebuilding their strength, I go upstairs for snack. Our friend has returned from the market and is preparing dinner. She offers me and my son some snacks - a bag of fresh plums that have just been picked and a bag of cornichon pickles. My son reaches into the pickle bag. Inside the bag is a little green car the same size and color as the pickles. I let him have it. We eat. While we are eating, a woman with black coiffed hair comes in the front door. She is the ex-girlfriend of the man who I was attracted to. She says that she has just returned from her travels and is going to drop her things off upstairs in his room. I go back downstairs and find that the others have moved downstairs to the healing pools. The obese woman is in her own warm pool soaking. The others are in another pool. The man is leaning against the side of the pool and his neck is sore from getting her downstairs. I slip into the water, too. I offer to help his neck, but he declines even though he is interested. He doesn’t want to ask more of me. Another woman who was helping asks if I can help her because she is also sore from the ordeal.",Ana,last_nights_dream

I don’t know if I’m there because initially I was supposed to go and help move them from where they were. But when I get there, I realize they just need a home and supplies and they just need to be taken care of. I give them whatever supplies I have in my car and end up leaving the car there (I think it’s the Chevy Volt that I have). I also have my kids with me, I think. We head towards a big farmhouse down the dirt road. There are fields of grass and fences along the side. We get to the house. It belongs to somebody I know, maybe my parents. Now I have my kids and my daughter’s friend. Josh is there, too. I’m getting something ready for all of us and I keep remembering one more thing, then one more thing, then one more thing. Eventually Josh is like, “We gotta go.’ He takes the kids and puts them all in the car then drives off. I have this funny little Chevy Volt, a tiny tiny car, and it’s left for me to drive. It actually looks more like a Flinstone’s car. I keep gathering stuff up and as I’m heading out the door I see all these northern flicker feathers (they are orange on one side and black on the other) and some black and white feathers that look like striped zebras. They’re so many of them as I’m trying to get in the car. I keep hearing the ancestors saying, “Pick them up. Those offerings are for you. Pick them up.” There are maybe twelve feathers and they’re actually longer than flicker feathers because they’re the length of my forearm. I keep picking them up and picking them up, and wondering what does all this mean and why are there so many feathers. In the meantime, I’m thinking in the background that I have to go and I have to catch up with Josh and the kids. I’ve gotta get going, but I’m picking up these feathers and it’s so important that I have them and I keep them with me in this Flinstone’s car that I’m driving.

I found a route that diverged from the main one via a smaller windy road. Then I thought we could take a dirt road that went through the valleys between mountains in the desert. Instead of looking at a 2d map it had become a 3d model and I was there following the contours of the place where the road was. I became less certain it was a road.  I found myself in the location on the map. I was exploring the desert but became terrified that I would be bitten by a snake or spider. I began to search the ground in front of me carefully. I saw a few spiders and thought I saw snakes but they were never there  My dad showed up and I explained the dangers of the situation to him. It helped having him but was still dangerous as I was leading the way back. We walked through a dilapidated wooden structure and saw a mask hanging on the left wall.

In the picture we could tell it was late summer because we were just taking down the pool. The pictures were 3d and could be entered. I also saw all of us in the kitchen on a school day with our mom. We were all happy and eating or cooking. I specifically remember looking at my face and thinking that I was about 15 years old.   We moved back to our old house and bought it. I surveyed the yard which was fenced in by high metal chain linked walls. I ran into the fence in my excitement and my dad laughed good naturedly.   Carson had already left to go exploring and as William and I had never been back we decided to explore together. The buildings looked very familiar.,Bob,last_nights_dream2

1487,1240,,06/10/2020,10/06/2020 00:05,"I’m going to this party or dance. I distinctly remember feeling like I did in high school when I was getting ready for high school dances - the anticipation and excitement. This dance is a larger party. I know I’m going to see my friend Janet from high school. I’m really excited about it. I walk into the house where it’s at and she’s right in the foyer. We’re both so happy to see each other. We throw our hands up in the air and hug each other hello. It’s so good to see her. Janet is shorter than me. I haven’t seen her in at least ten years. She’s happy to see me. I’m happy to see her. I’m a little bit surprised that she’s happy to see me, but it’s fun to be reunited. Then I go into the rest of the party. It’s interesting because I don’t really know the rest of the people there. I’m mingling and having a good time. Then my beloved Josh is there. I don’t know if I came with him or not. But he’s there and hitting on chicks, getting to know people as he does. I see him take one off to go fuck or do whatever they do. I say something to him like, “Hey, take the condom.” I watch them go off. Then I turn around and look for anyone I’d like to fuck. I think not really. Some of them are old high school classmates, but others I don’t know. Interesting thing is, this house is owned by my friend’s ex. He owns the house and he’s the host. He has all this money and the house is really big with tall windows. The living room is really open and the windows slide open like patio doors, but they’re taller than patio doors. You can see that his yard is gorgeous and two houses down is an empty lot. New houses are being built there. There’s water off the backside of this house - it’s a canal of some sort. The party is still happening and I go out the front doors to the garden. The garden looks a lot like my old garden in Corvallis where I had turned over the soil and made the garden a small section of the front yard, so I could still have a path. I go over to the soil. There’s a bunch of little kids and it’s like a Waldorf school is having an outdoor class and they’re learning about gardening. But this area where the garden is has big holes like a dog had been digging. It’s dug down to where there’s black plastic that has been put down to create a barrier between where there was grass and all the new rich nutrients that had been put on top. There’s nothing growing in the garden right now; it’s just the black dirt and mulch and all these holes. I look into all the holes and all of them have something slightly different in them. One hole has pens, one hole has an old dog leash and collar, and I’m like, “I don’t think we want those in there if we’re going to be growing stuff.” I reach down to grab these things out. The kids are very intently looking to see what I’m doing. I’m just removing the trash from this garden area that hasn’t been used. It needs clean up, that’s for sure, and nothing is growing in it. I have a recollection of the owner of the lot saying, “Oh yeah, I think I should just buy this other lot two houses down, then I can have an even bigger house.” The way he says it, he’s being a pompous ass. I don’t get it. I don’t know who he’s showing off for and I don’t know why he needs another house two houses down.",Rose,last_nights_dream
1488,1460,,06/10/2020,10/06/2020 00:06,"“Homeless” This dream just seems to start where I’m in a house that’s not mine. I was only able to bring a few of my things. One of the things is my spices. I found a big shelf for them. It’s deep enough to hold a spice bottle. There are eight shelves just spice bottle height apart. They’re pretty wide and there are two of them. I found them somewhere; somebody threw them in the garbage. I thought to myself: “These would be perfect for my spices.” I am surprised when I see them on the wall and wonder who did that. Anyway, they’re there and I’m glad to see them. I’m looking around for my clothes and I don’t know where they are, but I’m sure I was able to bring them. The bed is as wide as it is long. It must be a King size bed. I realize that that’s where I’m sleeping. As I’m looking through the dressers for my clothes, someone comes in and it’s Keith who I know from the studio. He’s sleeping on the other part of the bed. I feel really uncomfortable with this arrangement, but I’m glad I at least have somewhere to sleep. I move as far to the opposite edge of the bed as I can. When he enters the room he tells me, “Oh by the way, your clothes are in that dresser.” I think, “Okay good. I’ve got something to cook with and I’ve got some clothes.” I also have a wagon with a handle. I sleep but it’s a restless sleep. I’m too conscious of not rolling into him or something. The night passes. I see that the light at the windows is moving from dark to grey so I can get up now. As I’m getting out of bed, I accidentally lean my elbow on a part of his private parts and I feel really bad, but he doesn’t wake up. I get up anyway. I’m sorting through the clothes in the dresser, trying to put what’s mine in the wagon. I think, “Well, there’s no room for the spices, I guess I’m going to have to leave them here.” So I leave the house adn go out onto the sidewalk. I’ve put too many things in the wagon and the sides aren’t high enough, so they keep falling out and getting dirty on the ground. But I don’t have anywhere to wash them. As I’m at the intersection, there’s a big mailbox. I don’t have a key for it. The postal service worker has opened the front of the mailbox so I can see what’s in my mailbox. It’s a whole bunch of CDs. I think, “Oh, I mailed those to myself so I can still have them.” But the postal service worker says I’m not allowed to keep those in the mailbox and instructs me to take them out right then and there. I already don’t have enough room for my clothes and wonder how this is all going to fit in the wagon. I take all the clothes out and think, “Well, they’re dirty anyway.” So I put them out on the ground and it’s a slushy snowy day. I put the CDs in the bottom of the wagon, then put the clothes back on top. It actually works out not too badly. I think, “Well, okay.” Then, I’m walking along the sidewalk. I’ve been invited to go to this staff meeting at the hospital where I used to teach. So I drag the wagon along with me, walk all the way to the hospital, enter the hospital, find the staff room and go in. it’s a Christmas party. They all have brought food to share. I don’t have anything so I feel conspicuous. The ladies, however, are really nice and they’re saying how much they miss my classes and what a good teacher I am. The feeling of being conspicuous and awkward starts to wear off a bit. This one lady says, “Oh look at what I’ve got on DVD!” It’s one of my classes. She says, “Here, we can actually do the class. We haven’t had a cardio class in years.” So she puts in the DVD and a few of the ladies start doing it, but this makes me feel uncomfortable again. I leave that room and go into a different room. In this room are the teenage kids of the staff. They’re sitting around kind of bored and are starting to throw food around just for something to do. I think, “Oh! I’ve got all these CDs in my wagon. Maybe that will entertain them and they’ll just sit here for a little bit.” I want to extend the time that people stay at this party because it’s warm in here. There’s a couch and there’s a little bit of food and I don’t have anywhere else I can go for the night. So, I start to sort out the CDs. I’m putting them in alphabetical order which is something I’ve never done in my entire life, but it organizes them well enough that the kids are starting to sort through them. In fact, all of them are quite occupied with this and they’re each picking out one that they like and playing it. Then one of the parents comes in and says it’s time to go. The kids start leaving one by one by one. I feel really sad. I see that it’s starting to get dark. There’s a dog in the room. I wonder because people are leaving and the dog is still there if it doesn’t belong to somebody. So, I follow it as it walks from that room into the bathroom. I see it has vomited all over the bathroom. There’s a little pile of dog shit on the counter. There’s vomit in the garbage pail. I’m wondering if the dog is sick or no one took it outside. So I'm asking people whose dog is this. Nobody claims it. More and more people are going. They don’t take any of the food with them. I’m starting to wonder if I could maybe stay there and no one would notice. I think I might as well take the risk. But what am I going to do with this dog because it’s shitting everywhere? I don’t want to go outside because I’m afraid if I go outside, I won’t be able to get back in. There's one woman left. I say, “Isn’t this your dog?” She says, “No.” I say to her, “Could you not take it with you, though? Wouldn’t your kids love this dog? I think it’s really sick and it needs somebody.” She agrees to take it. They leave and I’m alone in there. I’m starting to gather my CDs together in a pile. Every time I stack them, they fall. None of them will stay in a stack anymore. I take a big giant knife and cut them in half, then I cut them in half again. I put the pieces back in the wagon. I put my clothes over top, but they seem to have disappeared. I wonder if the kids have taken them. There’s only a few clothes left; it’s mostly just these pieces of CDs. While I’m sitting there, one other person comes out. He must have been in the bathroom. He asks me if I need any help. I say, “No.” He says, “Oh, I have some interesting news for you that you might want to hear.” I say, “What’s that?” He says, “Remember your friend Amy?” I say, “Yeah.” He says, “She’s been accused of lying about other people’s dreams. I thought you might want to know that.” I think, “Well, I guess it came back around.” I’m sad for her and wonder what’s wrong with her that she does that to get attention. I guess that’s good that people know I wasn’t lying.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

We were walking on a path to California, then we heard something coming and we went into the bushes to hide. There is a fence behind us. On the California side is a restaurant that we were heading to. The dogs are coming. We’ve heard about these dogs and how they can be vicious. We take out a bottle of lotion from our bag and put lotion in our hands, then get some sticks to protect us just in case. We are hoping the dogs will just walk on by. At first, the dogs are just puppies. Every dog that walks by is a little bit older. As the dogs get older, they get more wild and ragged looking, also heavier and denser with more wrinkles in their skin. The dogs keep getting bigger and bigger. They keep walking by, not pausing to notice us. We think we’ll be okay. Then, one of the biggest and oldest dogs stops right in front of our hiding spot. He turns and stares towards us. He stays there for a long time. After a long while, I start to get antsy. I point up to the fence and ask my husband if I can climb up to the top and then he can go and take care of the dog. He says, “Sure.” I climb up and am surprised I can so easily get up there. My husband advances on the dog. He doesn’t have to smear the lotion in the dog’s eyes or poke it with the stick. The dog just decides to move on. Now all the dogs have moved on. We go across the border, too. We see my friend Maxine and her boyfriend. they’re at the bar ordering a lot of drinks. They’ve traveled a long way to get here and celebrate. I’m a little concerned because she is drinking a lot and they have to drive all the way back once the restaurant closes.

There starts to be more than just one or two people in the hallway. Now there’s four, then eight, then sixteen; they’re multiplying exponentially. Then they’re starting to talk to each other. The voices sound aggressive. I notice at first that it’s all just men. Then there are so many that there’s no longer any distance between who I am and the rest of the men. They’re only inches away from me and now there’s even more. I’m starting to see facial features. They all look kind of angry. Then someone says, “These aren't regular men. Look, this man’s gay.” As soon as those words are uttered, the crowd turns in upon itself. Someone starts throwing a punch at the other one. Then there’s a punch thrown back. Then just as quickly as the crowd multiplied exponentially, so do the punches. Then some of them start running. They’re running down the hallway. Because the marble floors are so slippery, there’s this sideways running. During the sideways running, the part of the crowd that’s chasing almost catches up. I fear that they’re going to be killed. There are so many chasing them that if they catch them, that’s the end of it. But then they regain their footing and they start to make some space again as they’re running down the next hallway. Then I’m in the crowd, I’m not just watching. I’m looking for a place where we can blend in so the people who are chasing us won’t recognize us. Or is there a door that isn’t just a courtroom but actually leads to someplace we can hide. So this goes on. The hallways are endless. There’s nowhere to blend in because someone keeps recognizing us. Then at one point, there’s enough distance between us and the people chasing us. I open one of the doors. You can hardly see that it’s a door because it’s a white door within a white wall. I open it up and run in. it’s got a push-in button lock. I can feel somebody on the other side of the door. The door handle is in my hand and I’m trying to push the button, but the person is turning the door so that the button keeps popping out. It keeps happening over and over and over again. Then I think this is it and I’m done for. Then I hear this voice on the other side saying, “Please let me in!” I’m like, “Alright it’s not someone trying to chase, but someone trying to hide.” I open the door up and this big round man comes in. I think we’re not going to fit in here because he’s so big. But we do. Now he's in front of me. I think to myself that if someone opens the door, they’re not even going to see me because he’s so big he’s filling up the space. Then I can feel that his body feels soft and doughy, it’s almost like it’s absorbing me. I think, “Well, at least it’s not uncomfortable.” Then I hear the crowd and the noises of the feet pounding and the yelling. They’re getting closer and closer and closer. Then they’re right outside the door. I feel them going a little away and then they’re gone in the distance. Then it’s quiet. I start to let out my breath. My heart’s pounding so hard that I can’t breathe. It starts to subside a bit. I get an inhale again. After some minutes, I’m starting to breathe again. Both of us are scared to open the door. It’s pitch dark in here because there is no justice here. It’s quiet for long enough that the building sounds empty. I think the fight has just gone on outside. It didn’t disappear, it’s somewhere. We open the door, go into the dark hallways. There’s no one in the building. It sounds like no one is in here. We walk down the hallways until we see the door back to the street. The street is dark. This other person just disappears. I’m walking and wondering where to go. Then I see one shop that looks open. It looks like a curio shop. I open the door. It has one of those cowbells on the top and makes the cowbell noise. An elderly woman comes out. She tells me, “I’m over here if you need me.” She disappears into the piles and piles of stuff. I go off into the room to the right. I don’t have any money. At first it just looks like junk, broken, dusty, dirty things. I don’t even really want to sort through them. Then as I look at things more closely I think it’s not just piles of junk, but actually antique furniture. You can see where she started to decorate the furniture to make it look like a store with lamps and tablecloths and little ornaments around those. But as no one was buying anything, she’s collecting and hoarding them. Eventually you couldn’t tell where the arrangement was and where it was just things upon things upon things. But I become interested in the layers because it’s the furniture I’m trying to decipher. In one corner of one room, I’ve sorted my way into it. I’m interested in this desk because it looks like there is a secret compartment in it somewhere. So I’m moving things around, taking all this stuff off it...broken picture frames and I wonder who these people are and setting them somewhere else. I’m moving the lamps. There are too many broken things that I can’t tell what’s what. But once I move a lot of the broken stuff, I can start to see actual things. I move the lamp. There’s a kitchen utensil and it’s old enough that I don’t recognize it. I’m wondering what it was used for. Then I’ve cleared enough of the space on top of the desk that I can open it. It’s one of those roll tops that rolls back into itself. Now there’s stuff inside and it’s just crammed with stuff! So I have to move all these other things. Suddenly there’s a man beside me. I recognize him as this guy who I talked to for a little while then realized he wasn’t a very nice person so I stopped talking to him. Every word he said was so insincere. He says to me, “Look, there are two little pieces of wood at the back of this. If you lift them up, it exposes a secret compartment.” I say, “Oh, how did you know this? There was so much stuff in front of this.” He says, “Oh, I’ve been in here for a really, really long time.” Then he goes back to sitting on the floor. It’s like he’s a prisoner there and he’s trapped somehow. I’m looking to see what was in this compartment. It’s cartons, like the kind of boxes that look like shoe boxes but are made of pretty material...or maybe it’s wallpaper over cardboard. But you see older ladies with them. They wrap things in material and tissue paper so dust moths don’t eat them. There are a whole bunch of these stacked in here. I wonder if this actually belongs to the old lady who has this store. I find her. I go into the other room and find her and say, “One of the desks in the other room has a secret compartment.” She looks at me with some surprise and affection and says, “Oh, you’ve found it!” I say, “Yes.” She says, “Well let me know if you need any help, I’ll be over here.” I think she doesn’t mind that I’m looking through all this stuff and sorting it. I go back into the first room and am thinking that it’s okay to look through all these things! I’m sorting them into different piles. I leave the desk open the way I found it. I go across the room. The man is still there and he has his eyes closed like he’s trapped. It looks like he can’t move away from that spot. In this one corner of the room, I’m sorting through things and I find this beautiful string of lights. There are only five lights on it. It looks like hand-blown glass. The blue is a beautiful color. In fact, you can see the different elements in the blue that would have been exposed when the glassblower was blowing it to make the bulb. You can see bits of orange and terracotta and different shades of this deep carnival royal blue. I’m admiring them and thinking, “Wow, here’s this beautiful thing hidden amidst all of this junk.” I set them carefully aside. Now I find a picture with a round oval frame. It looks like me when I was a little girl. I set that beside the string of blue lights. I wonder what else is in here that maybe once belonged to me when I was young. That’s when I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

A black girl of about my age knocked on the door and introduced herself. We started talking and I became interested in her. She stayed with me most days and we cooked meals together. We were cooking our second meal, a salad or stew, and I had her grate the carrots while I cut up cabbages. She mostly finished the carrots but was left with a large piece of moist and mushy carrot the size of a grapefruit. I thought she might have been able to grate more but I didn't press it.  .....  The room had turned into a hostel and many other guests were trickling in and taking their seat on bunk beds. It was all couples and families. I woke up early around 5am but all of the clocks in the room were showing different times. We got ready and eventually went to get breakfast.   I made a mistake getting in line but corrected it. I got to the table where there was food but only found ice cream, cookies, and cinnamon rolls. I took an ice cream cone and one of each of the rest.

We are throwing things in the water that float on the surface and attract fish. My son has a life vest on. As we are turning the boat around, I throw my son into the water so he will swim. I thought the boat was going to stop but it keeps on going. My son is in the water and I’m looking to see if he is still floating. I see him on the wake from another boat. So when the boat swings around, I see him and my heart is relieved to see him floating and riding the wave with his head turned to the side. It looks like he’s having a good time. I lean over and pull him up by the life vest back onto the boat. The boat pulls over to a grassy bank. We get out. There are picnic tables and a few families are camping and getting a meal ready. My son just invites himself to join, immediately finding the kids and playing with them. I’m looking around and notice it’s children and elderly people, no one in between. Somehow, I have the birth records of all the people. I’m looking through the papers and see that there’s an 11 year old girl, a 9 year old boy, a 91 year old man and a 90 year old woman. I’m a little concerned for their health and COVID risk. Then I go inside one of the cabins. A puppet show is happening, a story of creation.

It’s quite damaged, but she is whispering to the board and asking it to be rideable for this day. In another scene, I’m at a celebration for Ted, an award’s ceremony honoring his work in the hospital. I’m smiling at him through the crowd. His parents are there.

There’s water on the floor, about an inch of it, and it feels damp and cold. I’m inside with three people. We’re taking turns sleeping in shifts. We can only sleep for a maximum of eight minutes. We’re practicing a rotation that we can take this copper wire thing and roll it up into a key. It’s kind of shaped like a paperclip. We have to take it out of its shape and roll it into two other things within a certain amount of time. One of the shapes, you take one end and it ends up looking something like a flower. And the other, I’ve already forgotten what it looks like. We’re really, really tired. Everybody wants to sleep more than we are, but we can’t because we’re training ourselves to escape this place. We’ve got this old lumpy mattress on the floor so it keeps you off the water. There’s one set of sheets. The person who’s sleeping gets to stretch out and the rest of us are just sitting on something like one of those trundle buggies or wheely carts where you put things in them for shopping and they have a handle. Homeless people use them or the elderly. So we’re sitting on that to keep us up out of the water. So you not only have to be able to snap out of your sleep quickly, you also have to be dropped into your sleep quickly. If we can do all of this within eight minutes - fall asleep, wake up, fold the wire into the two different shapes - then we’re sure we can manage our escape. Everybody has to go through the rotation and there are four of us all together. So we do this. It repeats in the dream four times. One person has a really hard time waking up and it’s making all of us anxious. We’re shaking her and saying, “You’ve gotta get up! You’ve gotta get up!” She finally wakes up. We make her go through that a couple more times so she is waking up at the proper time. When she does, we take the sheets of the bed, but we have to leave the top cover on so it looks like people are still sleeping there because there’s somebody that comes around and checks and if they realize we’re gone before we’re all the way out of the building then we might get caught. So we have to practice taking the sheet off without disturbing the top cover. I’m actually quite good at this. We do it and I’m instructing the others, telling them how to do it.

I was standing on the wooden porch overlooking the water when a neighbor's boat came by. I rushed down the stairs to the water to stop it. I used a boat hook and snagged it but the current was so strong that I was pulled out and around the house almost ending up in the water. No one was helping me and I was sliding off of a dock toward the water. By a miracle I managed to stay on dry land and successfully saved the boat. In the process of doing this I had to take some small white pieces out of the boat. Whether that or the pieces were damaged in my attempt to save the boat. Grandma O. said that the owners would be angry with me but I was sure this was unreasonable.  The storm continued and my dad was on the computer looking at a radar map for the country.

By political I meant racial because the man was black and thought I was being racist. I left and told him I'd find another ATM.  ...  I instead followed the black man who turned into an old white hobo back to his house. He needed my help with something. When we got there I became convinced that he was creepy. We talked for a bit, and at the end of our conversation he told me that he used to have dozens of arms and legs. At this point I knew that he was a schizophrenic and decided to leave. I asked if he had had all of his extra limbs amputated to which he responded that he had. I wanted to show him that I trusted him. Then I said that I needed to return home and that my mother would be worried at how late I was. He understood and I was not worried about him trying anything.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

I would look up and call out to people to watch out. I saw things coming my way and was able to deflect them and people were like, “How did you do that? That was amazing!” and I was like, “I just looked!” There were these big long boards that would break in half and hit people.

1526,613,,10/10/2020,10/10/2020 00:07,"This dream was dark. I was hiding from people and looking for someone, my baby or my daughter. I was alone. It was grey green out. I would hide from place to place and there was a road that I kept traveling and the more I traveled it, the more familiar it became and shorter it became to get to this place. I called someone on the phone and asked them about directions but didn’t want to give away that I knew the modern name for the road because I knew they didn’t know it yet because they were from the past. I knew it as Road 1 and referred to it as Road 9 but even that didn’t make sense to them. The road had FOG so much fog on it. When I arrived I stayed somewhere creepy with these dolls everywhere but I realized they were broken tiny babies and deformed and in pain. There was one person watching them. There were houses and houses of them all tiny to larger and more deformed and grotesque and they were missing limbs and in pain. The bigger ones looked like paper mache. I was hiding and searching and calling around for my daughter. I found out that my ex Rory had been to visit her six times and I didn’t even know she existed. She was mine but also Asian. When I found the house where she was I was so relieved because the caretaker explained to me a little about it, she asked me, “Are you coming to say goodbye?” and I said, “I think so.” She was Asian and handed me black silk pants and a purse to hand to my daughter and said, “She looks just like you with the hair and eyes,” and I was confused but relieved and crying and sad to do this. I had never done this before and now that I was going to say goodbye, I had so many questions. I was glad the place was nice and not decrepit like all of the other places I had been searching. Some of the places had been abandoned and just full of dead babies. I was just about to meet her when my dog moved and I woke up.

1529,1464,,10/10/2020,10/10/2020 00:10,"“Missing My Resources” I’m living in an apartment building that is really high up. I’ve never lived in anything like that before. The height is a bit dizzying and I can feel a bit nervous when I come out onto the balcony in terms of not being safe at that height. But I start to get used to it after I do it a few times. I’m living there with my baby, it feels like my first born child. I’m not quite used to how to do things with a baby to organize my time. I’m working online. I only have one room - it’s a kitchen and living room with a little area for a crib and the things the baby needs. I have a table with my laptop on it and other things that I think I’m going to need to teach online. My baby won’t sleep very well. She’s very sensitive to not being held. So she relaxes and closes her eyes after she nurses, but as soon as I set her down, no matter how slowly I do it, she wakes up once she’s in her crib. She doesn’t cry very much. She’s very quiet. She’s just sensitive. I’ve tried wrapping her up so she feels like she’s still bundled. That maybe lasts for another sixty seconds once she gets in her crib, but she still wakes up. I end up carrying her around on my left hip quite a bit. Other than the fact that I’m worried she’s not sleeping enough, this is okay because she is quiet when I’m teaching. I’m teaching online various things. I’m training teachers. I’m also hosting my own classes and making meditations. I’m trying to reduce twenty-minute meditations into a five-minute trailer so that they will interest people into purchasing the twenty-minute and the five-minute trailers are free. As I’m doing this, I also have students live, at least I think they’re live. It kind of feels like a hologram, but they’re still learning from me online but they’re a hologram and I can see them in my apartment. They’re leading their own programs in other places. Someone has some managerial duties for when those programs are released. I can see her there and it’s my old boss. She’s highlighting one of my students who has mined all my material and is just teaching it as her own without crediting me at all. This is upsetting me. I’m trying to make an appointment with my old boss about this, but she keeps dodging my calls and ignoring my emails. I’m getting the sense that she knows this student is mining my material and she’s deliberately highlighting her. My material has been available for a decade longer than my student’s and my old boss has seen it before. I’m trying to contact her to ask to be credited or for mine to be highlighted because mine has never been highlighted and she’s deliberately driving traffic away from me and towards this new student. At the same time as I know this is wrong, I also feel like I’m maybe too old and no one values me anymore because maybe I’m just viewed as old. I walk away from this to get space. I’m feeling really frustrated. My stomach and my throat are in a knot. I still need to finish making me these five-minute trailers. I step out onto the balcony and this is where I feel it’s so high up. It must be fifty stories high and you can barely see the ground. It shakes a little bit when it’s windy. There’s a big hoop on the balcony. It has colored ribbons all around it. It’s like one of those motorcycle stuntmen would rev up and then jump through. It looks like one of those American things that they would jump through. There are red and blue ribbons around it. It’s not only red and blue ribbon, but also some kind of neon reflector tape so that when the sun hits them, they’re really bright. It almost looks like it could be on fire from far away, but it’s not because I’m close enough to see it’s just the chemical structure of the fabric and its reaction to the light. There are two kids on it, they’re like tween girls. They’re playing some kind of game where they’re throwing something through the hoop and then they see what kind of pattern it makes on the ground. I’m looking and wondering what they’re throwing. At first I think they shouldn’t be throwing anything because it’s dangerous and it could hit somebody down below and at this height it could kill them. But then I see that as soon as it hits the ground, it dissolves because it’s actually quite a hot day. They’re throwing what looks like snow cones. As soon as they hit the ground, the cone material melts and it leaves this colored chalk residue on the asphalt. The design they’re making actually looks pretty and deliberate. I think they’re trying to hit certain areas because they’re doing some kind of art attack where when they land, it creates a picture. I still think that they shouldn’t be throwing from that height, but when I look down to the ground I can’t even say anything to them because there’s zero people around. I know my words would simply get lost in the wind. So I go back inside. I just sit there and enjoy some time with my baby. I’m no longer interested in teaching or talking. But the quality time with my baby is very nourishing.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I don't know what we’re doing in the house. There’s something we’re supposed to be doing as a group. I end up leaving the house. I go somewhere else. The house is in a city. I don’t know where I go, but I find myself trying to make my way back to the house but then driving a car. My dad is in the car and we’re going into the city through the backway to avoid the traffic and major roads. He’s in the passenger seat and asking me if I know where I’m going. I’m like, “Yeah dad, thanks, just be quiet and follow along. Don’t worry, we’ll make it to our conference.” But the GPS navigates me back to the house I had been at. This house had a lot next door to it with a rundown house and a bunch of land that was run down. When we get back, the house next door that was run down now is occupied by a cute lesbian couple. They’re bakers. They’ve fixed up the house. The gardens are all fixed up. They have right down the road an off the charts bakery that’s super fantastic. So we get there and my dad’s like, “This isn’t where we’re supposed to be.” I’m like, “Yeah, I know. But the upside of this is this bakery is available to us and we need to stop and get water anyway.” So we go into the bakery. The floors are wood. There’s a section with the bakery case. It’s packed! There are so many people - tourists from all over the place and locals. I go in and we walk up to the counter. I say, “I hear you guys are famous. Do you have grain-free and dairy-free desserts? I can’t eat those other things.” They’re like, “In fact, we do.” So they take me down to the far end of the case and show me the items that I can have. I’m so excited about it. My dad’s excited about it, too. We order the items we can order. But it takes a while for them to get them to us because there are so many people who have ordered and there are so many people in front of us. We wander off from the area to grab a water out of these coolers. There are drink coolers that seem out of place because the bakery is super cute, like a French bakery feel, but off in the corner with tables for eating is a Coca Cola drink cooler. It looks so out of place! I grab a water but am like, “Eh, what are these doing here?” The tables are super close together. I’m trying to get through the tables and keep running into people. In my mind I’m like, “This is not coronavirus six feet.” But no one is wearing masks and everyone is close. As I go through, there’s a table with an Asian woman sitting, and there’s a black man sitting at a table next to it. I’m trying to go in between them, but I’m rubbing legs with both of them to get to the drink cooler. The Asian woman gives me a dirty look. The black man is like, “Oh, I’m sorry, I’ll get out of the way,” but he’s giving me this mischievous grin and there’s a twinkle in his eye because we’re touching. I grin at both of them and just say “excuse me,” and go to the drink cooler and get a water for me and a soda for my dad. I go back through the big group. It’s still super crowded. I go back to the case where they’re handing out the desserts. I get there and am like, “Hey do you have my dessert?” They’re like, “We called you and you didn’t come. It’s taken us a while, but we have it.” I’m kind of getting scolded, but they give it to me anyway. It doesn’t look as pretty as it would have because it’s been sitting for a little bit. I’m a little disappointed, but I take it anyway. I’m like, “For sure, for sure, this is dairy-free and grain-free?” They’re like, “Yep.” I’m looking at it and am like, “That’s full of dairy if I’ve ever seen a dessert full of dairy.” But I take it anyway.

All my high school classmates are there, including my friend Teresa who I only went to school with for a couple years in seventh and eighth or eighth and ninth grade. We were really good friends. I think the party is in Hawaii because everyone is wearing sleeveless tops. It’s warm out. I can hear palm trees. I show up and everyone is in the usual clicks that they were in high school, which means I’m outside and not in any of them. But I’m still happy to see everyone. We talk. I mingle a bit and talk to everyone. I see my friends Ikaika and Teresa. I want to spend more time with her, but she’s with my classmate who lived in the same neighborhood I did. Everyone is friendly’ish, but no on is like, “Hi, I’m so happy to see you!” I feel a little bit awkward, but I guess it’s my fault for not keeping in touch with anybody at all. So, the party continues. People are like, “Let’s play a game!” All of a sudden, clothes are coming off. One of my classmates has a bag of candy bars. He’s like, “Alright, we’re going to stick these candy bars on our dicks. The point is for you to try and get them off.” I’m like, “What kind of game is this? How come our high school reunion just turned into a kink party? But, okay I’m going to win.” The party is outdoors. There are cocktail tables around. There’s a pool somewhere and people are getting in and out of the pool. We move to this grassy field so people can run around. We are playing tag like kids and running around with these candy bars. I finally snag somebody and they’re like, “That hurt me.” I’m like, “That didn’t hurt you. If you want me to hurt you, I’ll hurt you for real because I’m a professional dom.” Their eyes get kind of wide. I’m playing and this is definitely my type of game. But I’m also like, ‘What am I doing?!” Then, the scene switches. I’m driving to the beach in my brother’s car. It’s silver and an SUV of some kind. We’re heading to the beach. I go to park and it’s a really steep slope that goes right into the water. I’m trying to park but not end up in the water. The first time I park, the right front tire is round but it looks like I rolled an ankle the way the tire twists and turns inwards. Then the whole car rolls. I feel it roll and flip, but end up back on the wheels. Everything is okay. I’m like, “Holy shit, I don’t know how the car didn’t end up broken and how we didn’t flip into the water.” I’m sitting in the driver’s seat the whole time, but somehow I can see the car wheel and the way it curls in on itself like a twisted ankle, which is bizarre. I’m definitely panicking because I’m trying to park the car so we can meet other people at the beach and play and have a good time. I’m having a hard time parking, though. It rolls back on all four wheels and I’m like, “Okay, this is fine.” Then someone’s like, “Wait, you can’t park there, you have to move.” I’m like, “Yeah, but I’ve finally got it parked where it’s not going to end up in the water. But okay.” I pull forward and drive a little bit further down the road. I see this place where it’s a little less steep of an embankment down into the ocean. I’m like, “Okay, I’ll park there.” So I back the car up, park it and get out. I go to walk up the beach, but then turn around the car sliding backwards into the water. It looks like I had parked on a boat ramp, but the boat ramp was covered in fist-sized rocks and black and white coral. The rocks start to slide backwards down the ramp and the car slides backwards, too. The thing is, where this ramp is (and I didn’t know it was a ramp when I parked), on either side are these shops. The shops are sort of hovering above the water and there are people in the shops. There are so many people watching and yelling as my car slides backwards. It slides down the ramp and I’m watching as it starts being covered with water. At the bottom of the ramp is another shop and the car ends up in the front area of the shop, but under water. All of these people are like, “Oh no, get the stuff out of the car!” They grab everything that was in the car, but we can’t stop the car from rolling backwards. I’m trying to stop it and they’re trying to stop it. But it keeps going, even though the emergency brake was on. I had pulled the emergency brake this time because I didn’t want it to roll like last time. So now the car is under water in this shop which is also under water. It seems to be fine that the shop is under water and people are still frequenting the shop. But my brother is pissed off because now I’ve drowned his car and I can’t get it out. My purse is soaking wet and it’s this leather purse with big handles, it’s quilted on the front with a maroon or purple color. I can very clearly see someone hand it to me. I have the keys to the car because I took them out when I parked it. Now I’m just stuck with this car in the water and I don’t know what to do about it. The dream ends right there.",Rose,last_nights_dream
1547,1465,,13/10/2020,10/13/2020 00:05,"“Goats and Ethics” I’ve been asked to teach a class in Ethics. I’m preparing for it by getting magazine articles ready that illustrate or talk about some kind of ethical situation. I notice as I’m preparing the articles that most of them center on the situation where it was done unethically. I think, “Hmm, are there not any articles where someone has behaved ethically?” I don’t really find any. Then I decide I’m not worried about it because I’ll just ask the students to read the article, say if they are in favor or not in favor of the way the author has presented it, and either way please back your reasoning up. I email the students the articles ahead of time so they can read them first. Then I go have a shower. I’m procrastinating. I only have an hour to get dressed, shower and get there. It takes me twenty minutes to get there. While I'm in the shower, I take the shower head off and I use it to pleasure myself. I wake up for a moment because I’ve stimulated myself to orgasm. I wait until the orgasm completes and then I finish my shower, only I realize that I don’t actually have time to wash my hair. So I rinse off the bit of shampoo and conditioner I put on to save time and get dressed. I make it all the way down to where I’m supposed to teach. I'm still a little bit early. I feel surprised by this in my dream. The students are still in a class scheduled before me, so I go into the kitchen. The place where I’m teaching is set up like my old house on C. Ave. I go into the kitchen and there is one guy sitting at the kitchen island. He’s drinking tea and eating a cookie. My friend Alice comes out from her class and is in the kitchen. She says, “You have to see this, come with me.” We go out the backdoor into the backyard. The backyard isn’t a yard; it’s a pool of water. But it doesn’t look like a man made pool; it looks like a natural occurring little tiny, tiny lake. She says, “This is just amazing. You have to see this.” We bend down and look into the lake. She says, “Look what I found.” I realize she has started clearing away the silt and organic debris from some kind of sidewalk, but it’s not made of cement; it’s made of what looks like wood, so there is some give to it and it swings a bit in the water. She says, “Look! It’s a goat path.” I think, “Okay, it does look like goats could navigate it. But goats climb up and this goes down. I don’t understand how it’s for goats.” So we’re kneeling at the side and she says, “Look.” I look into the water and there are ten dots. She says, “They’re post holes.” I think, “Oh! Well that must mean there were posts at one time.” She presses something and they start to go up - they’re growing up from the water and they go high up into the sky. She says, “At one time, the path went all the way up here on these posts and they could be used to send goats up there.” I think, “I wonder what the value is in that?” She says, “Well they would have used it when they were threatened.” I think, “Well, then, still I don’t understand what the goats did.” Then she tells me that the goats were weaponized so they wore some kind of apparatus around their bellies and if they were being shot out, it would release things that shot back. I think this is amazing technology. We also realize that it’s not wood that things are made of and the reason they’ve survived millenia is that they were actually made out of metal. I find myself speechless at the engineering technology that went into this with the mechanics of the goat path and the materials they made it out of. So it seems like the people who lived here before who were responsible for making this had a technology that was in fact far in advance of our own. She thinks that she and her partner can uncover all of this and refurbish it. I just think, “Wow, this is incredible.” Now other students are coming out and it’s 4:30. I realize it’s time for me to teach. I go back into the house through the kitchen and into the living room where I’m supposed to teach. There are about sixteen or seventeen students in the group and I can’t get all of them together at one time. Three of them are talking over top me, so loud that I can’t hear my own voice. I’m getting frustrated because my throat is starting to get sore and tight from having to raise my voice over top. I say this to them. I name them by name. I ask them to be quiet. I ask them to attend to the ethical statements in front of them and I want to hear from each one of them what they think. One of them starts talking and the rest of the group keeps interrupting. The student is distracted and starts doing something else. He starts a video game with some other guy in the group. It just goes on and on like this, one thing after another, and I can’t get them all on the same page to attend to each other respectfully in order to have this ethical discussion.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

1551,1244,,14/10/2020,10/14/2020 00:03,"I am with a fellow priestess/witch, but I don’t recognize her from this lifetime. I am apprenticing under her. I’ve already done my apprenticeship actually and now I’m coming to learn what she does at her station. She’s in this small tourist town with all four seasons, and it’s Fall now. I’m not exactly what she’s there for, but she’s showing me how she does the Work. There are some things I need to know about the job specifically. I’m not sure if she’s there for protection or what. We’re in a house, like an old cabin with walls made of wood. I’m watching what she’s doing. She has this rolling cart that’s got two tiers and a bunch of stuff on it. She’s showing me how to charge up some things. I’m looking out the window and there’s water everywhere, so I think we’re on a lake or something. The town is behind us. I’m watching her hands move. I’m watching each of the steps she’s taking. I go to put my hands near the cart with artifacts. Everything feels really strong. I can feel the energy coming off. She keeps asking things like, “Can you feel that? We’re adding extra protection.” I’m like, “Of course I can feel that. Everything is really strong. This is what I’m trained for.” At one point she interrupts herself and apologizes. She says, “These are my neuroses and I worry about these things. This is what I worry about, but I think you’ll be fine.” I’m like, “Yes, I will be fine. I’ve had the training. I’m strong. I can feel the energy coming off. I can direct and mold and shape it as you’re doing. This is something I know how to do.” Then I maybe leave her to go run an errand or something. The scene changes and I’m outside the house. I’m walking through the town on the streets. I know a car accident is going to happen and then I witness it but keep going because I know the people can handle whatever is happening because it’s not a bad one, it’s just a fender bender t-bone, but everyone was going less than 25mph. Everyone is okay, they just have to get everyone’s insurance information. I continue to this open air marketplace. There are all kinds of items that you would find at a fair trade shop. I think I’m getting an ingredient we need for the cart and the spells we’re casting. I’m vibrating and radiating so much power, and I’m watching who’s starting to follow me. While I think everyone in this marketplace is human, some of the people are wearing helmets with horns, and someone looks like a totem - the totem is gold and I can’t tell whether it’s a hat they’re wearing or if they just are the totem with the different animals stacked on top of each other. So I’m just noticing who’s following me, who’s attracted to my energy and who’s not. Some of the people following me do have what feels like somewhat ill-intent but I know I’m untouchable so I’m not so worried about it. Some of the people following me don’t even know why they’re attracted to my energy, they just are, and they’re harmless. I’m going on my way even though I see all the people who are attracted to me or who are tracking me. Some of them are magic-makers themselves and they can do magic but they’re just watching. I find the item I’m supposed to find. I’m still watching who’s coming in and out of this market, noting who the non-magical beings are. I walk by this booth where they’re closing up shop because it’s twilight and the open air market is closed. One of the people closing up shop is Janaya Future Kahn and they are someone I know from instagram who identifies as “they.’ They are beautiful and on instagram they do social justice work. The way they talk is so amazing, always coming from love. Even in my dream as I’m walking past them in their booth and they’re folding things up for the evening, they’re talking about love and getting things to people in need. I slow down long enough to watch them fold up one of their items and to listen to them talk. I’m so smitten because this person is such a caring, warm, loving person but also very fiery and passionate about what they’re doing. I know I’m to return back to my post, which is this house on the edge of the lake. As I’m walking back I see piers with sailboats and this house juts out over the water. It’s important that we’re over the water and that the water is under us in parts of our work. I’m watching the sun go down and it’s almost dark but the sky is all these beautiful colors. I know that I have all the skills I need for the task at hand. In fact, I’m overflowing with the amount of energy. I do think it’s interesting that when I walked by Janaya Future Kahn, they didn’t look up and see me; they were so focused on what they were doing that out of all the people in the marketplace who could feel me, they didn’t look up and see me at all. I thought it was so interesting that they were so engrossed in what they were doing and the conversation they were having with other people that they never even looked up.",Rose,last_nights_dream
1552,1616,,14/10/2020,10/14/2020 00:04,"I was the team captain of my Bible quizzing team. We had made it to Internationals but out team was weak. Even for myself, too much time had passed. Since I had last studied.   We were quizzing on Matthew and aa a test I kept asking myself to quote Matthew 20:21 but I couldn't quite remember what it was. There was another verse from a different book that I tried to remember, imagining that I was a coach answering the question in a coaches quiz. I couldn't remember the exact wording.  I decided to write up all of the questions used in the last event in an Excel spreadsheet along with some summary info on the quizzes. I was working on it while at a party with some other quizzers. There was alcohol and I had two drinks followed by trying some vodka and soda mixture.  As I worked on my computer to get the questions finished, an attractive girl to my right with dark hair was having trouble logging into her Word account to access a document. I offered to help but she wasn't interested. I asked her if she wanted me to send her my document when I was finished. She was hesitant but agreed so I asked for her user and password so I could add the document to her account. She didn't want to give me her password so I told her that she could enter it without me looking and that it wouldn't be saved.  I returned home to my parents house where I was alone with my sister. She went out to the backyard by the trampoline, and leaning up against the fence, she began to complete the list of quizzing questions. While she was working, two people approached her, attacking and subduing her. They did not rape her, but there was something sexual about it. I knew something was wrong and I called the police but they were busy and had no one to spare. Eventually I found my sister and she was alright. I felt guilty about not being able to protect her and worried that she had been traumatized. I explained what had happened to my parents.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

Later we walked away and I noticed that there were snakes in the ground that were pale pink. I overheard Lana telling Susan that she’s pregnant and sick to her stomach (don’t think she is in real life) and I had a feeling of envy and sadness that I would never know what motherhood was like.

1556,1245,,15/10/2020,10/15/2020 00:03,"I am hosting a party. I’m the adult and the others are maybe 11-17, all genders and sexual identities. I have this fancy apartment with big windows that go floor to ceiling and hardwood floors, definitely a very modern minimalist feel to it. There’s a fireplace. There’s an upstairs. The kitchen is big with pendant lights and a bar area. I have all these kids. I’m teaching them something but I can't remember what it is. We’re talking about all kinds of things. Their parents have all dropped them off and they’re here at the party for a reason, but there’s also some other agenda. I realize at a certain point that they really don’t need me to be the adult in the room telling them what to do and what’s up. They’ve got it. They understand all the things. At one point we end up in a conference room, not in the apartment. There’s a long table down the middle of the conference room. I can't remember what’s being discussed, but it seems like there’s problem solving happening. We spend some time in that conference room. When we come out of it is when I realize these kiddos don’t need me to tell them what to do; they understand what’s happening. We finish up and come back to the apartment and everyone is tired because we’ve been doing major strategizing. Everyone wants to rest, relax and hang out. I’m like, “Yes, of course. Let’s do that. We’ll hang out while we wait for your parents to come get you.” It must be cold outside because there’s a pile of snow boots and jackets all over the place. What’s funny is they didn’t prepare for this. When they were dropped off, they were in shorts and t-shirts, but after the conference it’s freezing. So there’s all kinds of boots everywhere that we scavenged from somewhere - I don’t know if I had them in my closet or what. They got wet. One of the kids says they’ll put them near the fire. I say, “Well, there’s a big outdoor fire pit in this complex and I’ll just go put them in the fire.” But the shoes don’t burn, they dry. Then all the sweaters and jackets they’re wearing are mismatched. There’s a fuzzy purple hoodie with a white plastic zipper in the front. There’s another coat with horizontal black and white stripes and the occasional red or purple or blue or green stripe (the stripes are little). There are all kinds of different coats. I’m not sure exactly where the coats are coming from because none of the kids had them when they were dropped off. It’s like somehow we’ve managed to find what we needed so we could continue doing what we needed to do. Then it’s time for the parents to come and pick them all up. But some of the kids have grown in that time and become adults. So some of them are just leaving on their own, or as their parents come to get them, they’re standoffish the way teenagers are, which is kind of funny to witness. The kids are all leaving and it’s just me in the end. I’m standing there and kind of cold. I go and find some warm clothes. I feel changed after having had all these kids with me who grew up in front of me, especially as we were problem solving at the conference. After I finally get everyone out, I have a sense of relief in being alone because it was intense with a lot of concentration and effort. Now I realize there are changes that I need to make in my life. I can’t remember what the changes are now. I’m talking to my dad as the last of the kids are leaving and stating what I’m going to do. He keeps questioning me about it and telling me, “You shouldn’t do that. It’s not a good idea. You’re a woman, this isn’t a good idea for you.” I think that’s misogynist as fuck and I hear one of the otehr kids as they’re leaving telling him: “You don’t have the right to tell her that. Who are you to say that. She’s going to do what she’s going to do.” It’s very interesting to hear them tell him he doesn’t have to say and stop trying to control her. I’m noticing that I was being irritated because I wasn’t being heard by my dad. I couldn’t convince him of what I wanted; it took somebody else outside of me to tell him and then he backed off. In another part of the dream, I’m at work with my boss. There are a couple of other people. I’m making prints to mail. This one print comes through and it's not my boss’ artwork but the customer’s artwork that she sent digitally and somehow I’m printing it. When I see it, I’m like, “Oh, this isn’t your artwork.” She comes and looks at it and is like, “It’s definitely not.” There are huge instructions in the order and I’m looking at my boss like, “No. We don’t print other people’s artwork. I’m not going to do this.” She’s like, “Yeah, don’t do that.” We look over and there are packages with more of this customer’s artwork. I’m unwrapping the tissue paper and seeing a ton of pieces of art. The art is terrible. I’m looking at my boss like, “What am I supposed to do with this? Why do I have this? This is interrupting my flow with all the regular art shipping.” She shrugs her shoulders and wanders off to paint. I put all of it aside and am not going to deal with this now. There are a bunch of other people with us who are friends of mine. I was doing my shipping at a longer table, and it feels like I’m both inside and outside. I start hearing water off to my right. Someone is making noises like they’re going to orgasm. I look to my left and there are rooms down this hall. I look at my boss like, “Oh, who is that?!” My friend is there, too, and I think she’s in the room with somebody, but she’s not because she’s with me and shows up later. You hear this woman climax and my friend pops her head out from somewhere so I know it wasn’t her. We’re all like, “Who was that?!” We walk down the hall and it’s not somebody I recognize. She was blindfolded. I don’t know what exactly was happening but she was in this room and making all the noise and orgasming. There was another woman in there with her and a guy who I used to work with at the grocery store. He was the one who was making her orgasm. My interest is peaked and I’m like, “Hey can I get one of those? I want a turn!” Then I think he’s a Sagittarius and I wonder if he’s learned all kinds of things from travel. I also think he has a girlfriend who doesn’t know what she’s doing. I look at him like, “Can I get a turn?” and he blushes and is like, “No,” because he was just interested in that one girl. I turn around and leave the room. The dream ends.",Rose,last_nights_dream
1557,1466,,15/10/2020,10/15/2020 00:04,"“The Spectre” I’m in the house on A. Street. There’s some kind of renovation going on. There are also a lot of people. I don’t understand what they’re there for. I’m circulating through the various floors and chatting with people. It’s like someone invited me to an open house and I don’t know any of the people there so I’m just casually circulating around, except that I’m completely familiar with the house. So I don’t feel as awkward as I would normally in a place where I know zero people. I’m an outsider to the conversations. So I go upstairs then I go back downstairs. I sit on the porch for a little while. I’m an outsider to that conversation. Then I go into the main floor where the living room and kitchen are, and the same thing, I’m an outsider. Then I come back outside and I sit on the front steps. I turn around because something in the conversation peaks my interest. I look at them and I see this spectre. It’s black and has not necessarily a malevolent presence, but ominous. It’s leaning against the bricks. Other peoples’ eyes are facing it, but they’re continuing on with their conversations as though it’s not there. So I think they can’t see it. It makes me feel concerned because it’s like the usher that walks you down the aisle and it feels like death is the play that’s about to start. I wonder who is it there for? Then, on the lawn, there are a lot of children starting to gather. They're just playing a game with a stick - throwing the stick and catching it. There’s a ball that they’re kicking through a hoop. Now I wander through the house again. This time instead of just meandering, I’m looking to see if there’s any imminent danger or someone that’s unwell and might need some help. I go through the floors looking for that. When I get back down to the main floor I realize I need to use the washroom. I wander over that way. There’s somebody in it, so I stand outside and wait. When he comes out, he’s quite a chatty fellow. He starts trying to engage me in conversation, but I’m very uncomfortable because my bladder feels full and it’s pressing against me and I don’t want to engage right now, I just really want to use the washroom. But he’s oblivious to this. By this time I’m hopping from one foot to the other and saying, “Excuse me, please just one moment while I use the washroom.” He doesn’t stop talking. I just go in the washroom anyway and close the door. I’m sitting on the toilet and he comes in as though I’m not on the toilet and just continues the conversation! He’s talking about the renovations that he’s done to the bathroom. He’s actually quite impassioned and seems oblivious to me sitting on the toilet. Now my bladder’s been relieved so I’m able to focus on what he’s saying. It’s actually really interesting how he has renovated the bathroom on a budget, but it looks quite nice. I’m thinking, “Hmm, note to self, a couple of these are good ideas!” He wanders out and I finish taking care of my needs in the bathroom, washing my hands. I’m looking at how clean this bathroom is. It’s very nice but really tiny. All the grout is white and it’s got a lot of decorations, but everything is clean and dust free. I’m thinking that there’s something unusual about the man and his hair or head. He’s still standing outside the bathroom door chatting. I’m looking at his face. The skin around his face kind of grows right into his hair; he doesn't have a hairline. There is a lot of hair growing out of his ears, kind of the way a hedgehog’s face continues to grow into its fur coat. And with his stature, he looks like a hobbit. He has the engaging warm friendly countenance of the hobbits. He’s still chatting away. Now somebody else is interested in his conversation. I go back through the living room and out onto the porch. The spectre is still there. Now it’s starting to get dark; it’s twilight, but the kids are still playing and no one has come to collect them. They vary in age from five to maybe eight, so they shouldn’t be out in the dark on their own. I’m wondering who’s going to claim them. I stay. They’re still playing happily. One of them gets too close to the road. As part of the game, they lay down flat on their belly right at the edge of the road. I’m scared that a car is going to come around and not see them because they’re flat and it’s starting to get dark. I’m wondering at what point I should intervene. I’m watching for traffic and looking to see if cars are coming. In that period of time, the child gets back and goes to the lawn where it’s safe. Now there are people starting to gather at the right hand corner of the house. I see the spectre start to move. It has a scythe and suddenly the scythe gets really long and the handle is in the spectre’s hand. The spectre is reaching it up over its head and over to the other side because it looks like it’s intending to scoop someone with the scythe and blade standing there. I feel my body erupting in a big “No!” from the center of my being and I don’t know who it’s scooping. The crowd at the side of the house meld together - the people are indistinguishable from each other and I still don’t know who it’s claimed.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

As he walked, he would greet people and his microphone would pick up on the noise. He kept forgetting the lyrics to the song, and making things up as he went along. He stopped to apologize saying that he had forgotten the lyrics. He was very jovial and not at all bothered by this. One line in the song was ""Tomatoes and potatoes"" but it was wrong and he changed potatoes to something else.  I had been watching this on YouTube, but found myself in Germany following Morten Harket. He was entering a building and I stopped to look at the sign in front of it. It was a blue sign with three circles representing the Trinity. It was a Christian organization. The sign also said something about the Rhine. I waited and then entered the building purposefully. It was a fancy restaurant and everyone was speaking German. I walked around as if I knew what I was looking for so that no one would notice that I was out of place. I couldn't find Morten Harket or his band members and figured that they were upstairs.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

I went to go get dinner and it spilled all over me; this one guy came to talk to me and we started to hit it off but then he was telling me about two failed marriages and how awful all of his exes were and it was such an icky familiar feeling. He was white with thick brown hair, probably in his forties and built well for his age, very east coast. But I was like “nope!” Then a younger black guy came to sit with me and he was sharing that he is a doctor at NYU and basically prequalifying me about my masters and asking if I was going to do my PhD. I felt overwhelmed and left to take a shower. I was trying to get undressed without being seen, in a thick towel in this big shared room. I looked out the window and it was New York or something and I saw hand prints on the window of a neighboring building and skeletons but thought maybe they were Halloween decorations.

1564,1246,,16/10/2020,10/16/2020 00:04,"I’m with the kids and I’m in a city I don’t recognize at all. I think it’s supposed to be Seattle because there’s ocean and hills. It’s definitely a city. My ex shows up and his parents show up. I get this feeling of, “Oh my god, get the fuck away from me.” His dad is the most prominent person in the dream. He’s scolding me like I’ve done something wrong and I need to go with them somewhere. We get in the car - I don’t know if it’s my car or their car, but it’s a stick shift. I’m driving it backwards, like I’m in reverse the whole time. I’m having a fucking hard time staying on the road the GPS is telling me to go on. I keep driving onto the wrong road. At one point I get in a parking lot and I go around the parking lot three times. His dad is being condescending and telling me I’m going the wrong way. But I’m driving the way he wanted me to drive or the way he was showing me to drive and that’s why I’m having such a hard time. Finally after three or four attempts of trying to get on the right road to get where we were supposed to be going, I’m like, “Fuck it.” I stand up and turn around and sit in the car facing the way I’m used to driving it. Then we start heading towards their hotel room in the city. The kids and I were closer to the beach on the outskirts, but now we’re heading into the city. I don’t want to be with my ex, his dad or his mom. I don’t want to be in this car. I don’t want to be in this city. All of this is so wrong. Now I’m driving facing the right way and I’m following the GPS but it’s taking me weird places. I’ve never driven in this area before. We go through residential areas and I drive on the wrong road but we make it through. Then at some point I’m like “Fuck it, I’m not going to take this car because it’s going wrong places.” Now the GPS is saying, “Okay get out of the car and now you have to go on foot through all these places.” It’s still coronavirus times and there are all these weird things we have to do. Everyone else is wearing a mask but I’m not. At one point we are walking through a block party. I’m in the lead, but I can feel them behind me and the pressure to get it right and perfect is so intense. I’m getting frustrated because I don’t want to be there and I don’t want them to tell me what to do and I don’t want them to follow me and I don’t want to go to their hotel room deep in the middle of the city because they’re going to lecture me about some shit that’s not mine to do. I feel so much frustration. I’m taking a wandering meandering path. I walk through this block party and through somebody’s house. It’s a college kids party. I’m watching all the young college kids and can remember when I used to be like that and do that kind of shit and just be drunk as fuck. None of them are social distancing and I’m not either way. I walk through the house. I’m watching college girls in short skirts flirt. I don’t know if I see any guys at the party. I walk out the front yard and through another neighborhood. I’m walking down one road, but my ex’s dad is pointing up to one road that’s parallel to us - it’s like a freeway and there’s a chain link fence between that one and the one I’m on. He’s pointing up to that one like I’m supposed to be up on the freeway. I’m like, “Oh fuck no, I’m not walking up there.” I just keep going. They’re following me somewhat reluctantly. At some point, our paths do diverge and they go off somewhere. They end up in front of me and I start following them. Now we’re walking through a designated green area and park in the inner city. There are all these trees. We’re downtown on a street with four lanes. We hit a stoplight. We’re walking. There are black people lined up on either side of this road, sitting on a bench that seems to go on forever. In the background is a park with trees. I’m just walking through and wondering if this is a safe place for us to be walking through because we’re a bunch of white people and they’re a bunch of black people. My ex father in law and mother in law are not the most savvy about anti-racism. I’m hoping they won’t talk. We walk through this area and get to this place where there is scaffolding on the sidewalk that they've put up to work on the buildings above the sidewalk. The scaffolding is really narrow and tight. There’s a man helping us get through it because at some point you have to crawl up and then shimmy your way through a tiny opening that’s all scaffolding. I can see through it but it's metal bars and tiny so a person bigger than me could not fit through. He looks sketchy with long greasy hair in a mullet. He looks like the character from Schitt's Creek that looks like a redneck. He’s helping me through this tight squeeze, then I see him help the others. I don’t know where the kids are. So I go through this scaffolding maze and we come out the other side. We reach the hotel they’re staying at. It’s a hotel that they used to live at but moved away from. They’re just staying at it now because they had to come get me and my ex so they could tell us off about something, I don’t know what. We go into the hotel. We go up to the floor they used to be on. The hotel is a bit shabby and I'm surprised that they used to live there. They take us up to this floor and the Golden Girls live on this floor with them along with some other people. It’s hilarious. The Golden Girls and some other people are out in the hallway where there are couches for gathering. The Golden Girls are talking and laughing with each other. They’ve just had dinner and there are plates, dishes and cooking knives everywhere. My ex father in law shoos everybody home and says, “It’s late. It’s time for everybody to go home. None of you are wearing masks. Go on.” I’m like, “Oh no, here it comes.” I see the Golden Girls leave and go to their rooms. I think they’re flirting with a bunch of older men who are residents here, too. They all go back to their rooms. I see my ex father in law pick up a huge chef’s knife and he starts to clean it and put it back. He’s like, “They always leave their stuff out.” He says it kind of fondly but also with exasperation. My ex mother in law has been making comments with him this whole time, but I’ve been ignoring them most of the time. I’m still wondering why I’m here and why I’m with these people of all people. What do they want? What does my ex want? My ex hasn’t been saying much this whole time. But all three of them are giving me this vibe like: “You are fucking everything up. You are doing everything wrong. Now we need to get you and scold you and show you how it’s really done. And these are all the things you owe us.” I want out. The only time I had any control was when I was wandering through the block party and along the street with the black people - I knew I would be fine because I wouldn’t say something stupid. But now that we’re in this old hotel where we used to live and my ex father in law is cleaning this knife, I’m waiting for them to tell me what they’re needing to tell me. But that never happens and I don’t know what they’re wanting to say.",Rose,last_nights_dream

There are a couple of other people with me - my ex friend Lisa and Keith - and a couple of other people. It’s pitch black out, the night sky has no moon and no stars. It’s not unpleasant - it’s not rainy or snowy - it’s just dark. We walk for quite some time. We are supposedly going to Keith’s house, it’s a cottage or something. We get there and his mom is home. We are supposed to just be stopping to say hi to her, change our clothes, and then put the boat in the water. I’ve already walked around the backyard to see where the boat is. I’m looking at the water. Everybody seems to be taking a long time, so I go back into the house. They’re involved in quite a conversation with his mom. I’m waiting for them to finish talking and I sit down. Then Omar walks into the room and he sits down. It’s like they’re all talking but they’re not talking about anything, they’re just waiting. Eventually I sit down, too. I wonder why they’re sitting and waiting. I wonder what they're waiting for. I decide I might as well have a nap. There’s a pullout couch and it’s already been pulled out. I lie down on it. His mom comes over and sits beside me but she doesn’t say anything. She’s still in this kind of limbo. I’m not actually tired, I’m just lying down. Then the other guys get up as though they’re going to put their outdoor clothing on. I think we’re going, so I sit up on the corner on the pullout couch. But they’re not going; they’re passing around a joint. Then they go into this limbo again afterwards. I’m not sleepy, I’m just lying down because there’s nothing else to do. It’s pitch black. We’ve walked all the way there and I’m not going to walk home. I can’t go out in the boat by myself. Nobody is talking. I lie back down on the bed again. Then Keith comes over and he gives the joint to his mom. I wonder what’s in it and maybe it’s not a joint, but just looks like one. She puts it to her lips then takes it away and gives it to me. I think, “Hmm, I wonder what this is.” I put it to my lips. The smoke feels weird. I don’t like it. I take it away from my own lips and give it back to Keith.

My tribe is angry with me for retaliating against our enemy tribe for something they did to wrong us. They wronged us and I responded out of proportion by killing 1, 3, or 10 of their 33 tribesmen. I had just smoked some marijuana and was running from the members of my tribe along a dirt path. I stopped by a house and reached inside through a hole in the low roof and fished a pipe out which smoked for a few seconds before continuing. Until this point it was in 3rd person and I thought it was funny that I had stopped for the smoke.  I was caught in an open dirt area and I collapsed. The first man to get to me, who was brown and shirtless, punched me in the face though I was already down. He had to attack me since I deserved it. The rest showed up and I see an old man lying on the ground. He says that I should be thankful that my tribesmen are not going to rape me which is what sometimes happens.  They confront me and are angry explaining that our snuff stores are at 1/3 capacity and that we can only trade with our enemy tribe for it. I suggest that we trade them our prized possession, a TV which gets a single black and white crime show with episodes running every 16 minutes.  The man in charge eventually agrees and we go in to look at the TV. For a moment I am pulled into the show as two detectives look for a body. I can see an abandoned black and white duffel bag in a corner which they need to find.  Back at my place, I am my normal western self and not an African tribesman. We wonder if it will be best if I deliver the TV.  Back in the show I am working with several other cops, one with long blonde hair. I am investigating the upstairs of a concrete building and they are below.

1605,1468,,21/10/2020,10/21/2020 00:03,"“Message” I’m in a house. On the kitchen table are two notepads in a wicker basket. They have an eclectic assortment of many notes I made while I was on the phone, little lists, self-reminders, passwords, numbers. One is entirely all of this. I’m almost at the end of blank paper in it. I look through both of them to make sure everything has been covered or written down somewhere else or put where it’s supposed to be. One of them is like this and I know I can throw it away. The other one has a note in the middle of it. I can’t remember all of it, but there was the word, “isa” or “esa” with three numbers above and three numbers below. I can’t throw this one away; I have to keep it. In fact, I’ve been meaning to tear out just that one piece of paper because it’s proof. What it’s proof of, I’m not sure. But in the dream, my biological mother has been telling lies about me. It’s abusive. None of it is true. I’ve done a lot of self-healing and self-parenting around that and accepted that she will always tell those kinds of lies and there will be some who believe her, but I’ve moved on and am living my own life. But when I go through these notebooks, I see this one note and am shocked to see it. When I see it, I’m like, “Oh, this proves that i was telling the truth!” So this is why I do suddenly want to keep this note even though I hadn’t thought of all those wrongs she did to me in so long. Somebody comes along and moves the basket around and takes the notebooks before I’ve had a chance to put this one notebook in my pocket. I’m trying to find out who moved them and what they did with them. There are renovations being done in the next room in the house - the living room. There’s a man in there wearing white coveralls - the type that painters wear. He’s up on a ladder and he’s starting to cut in the edges around the ceiling with the brush the way painters do before they use the roller to the walls. I notice that he’s got the top half of a toolbox - like the red metal toolboxes people carry around with the insert you can lift out with a handle and some of the heavier tools stay in the bottom. He has this, but instead of it being full of screwdrivers and whatnot, he’s cemented up the carrying part of it so all that’s accessible is just this handle. I ask him, “Have you seen the notebooks from the kitchen?” He says, “Oh yeah, they’re in that basket over there.” I look and he’s pointing to the insert from the red metal toolbox that’s been cemented up. I say, “How long ago did you do this?” He says, “Eh, about five or ten minutes.” I ask him if the cement is still wet enough that I can break it open and get my notes out of there because I really need one of them. He’s indifferent and says, “Eh, you can if you want. I don’t care.” Then he continues his cutting with the paintbrush. I’m indecisive. I think if it’s in there, it’s in there forever and the cement is going to harden momentarily. Then I decide that I do want them. So I look around for something to break the cement with. He has a putty knife with a wide blade. I’m pressing it into the top where the two seams meet. The cement is still kind of wet. I get both notebooks out and am looking through both of them. I don’t see the one note anymore. I go through them again. It’s still not there. Then I go through them again, really slowly, one page at a time. It’s painstaking; it’s tedious.

They are shouldering in front of each other and getting more food than they are allotted or is appropriate for the number of people who are here.

1610,1247,,22/10/2020,10/22/2020 00:04,"I’m in the living room of my childhood home. There are a ton of people coming and going; some of them are my siblings, some are my siblings’ classmates, and I think some are my classmates, too. They’re all on a mission of some sort. I don’t know what they’re doing, but they’re coming home from some event they were at or some project they were doing. There are a lot of people, at least twenty, in the living room and more people outside. At one point I see a huge outrigger canoe being rolled through the yard and into the living room, which magically expands to fit it. I’m lying on a couch and pretty tired. I’m exhausted and just watching them come and go. People are stopping to talk with me but I’m not really involved in whatever is happening or whatever mission they seem to be on. At one point I sit up and look out to the driveway and the hedge that separates our house from the neighbor house. Behind the hedge is a gigantic tree with a treehouse in it. It looks like an oak tree in the way the trunk and branches are growing but I don’t know if it’s an oak because this is Hawaii. I’m watching people climb up and down the tree - it’s a treehouse but also an obstacle course with places where you can work out. It’s all somehow in this tree. I’m watching other people working out. Then I see a real tiger, orange and black, climb the tree and do the workout. I’m like, “Whoa, I didn’t know tigers could move like that.” I’m watching the tiger the whole time because I’m fascinated by what it’s doing and how it can do it, and also that it seems to be listening to the people. It’s as if it’s taking instructions from the humans - maybe not verbally, but from watching and then doing what they’re doing. Then the tiger climbs out of the tree and I think it’s going into the house through the backdoor. It’s at the backdoor and doing pullups on this pullup bar in the door. I see my brother (the one with the sustained traumatic brain injury in real life, but in the dream he’s normal and doesn’t have it). He is trying to pick up the tiger and use the tiger as a weight. The tiger is getting pissed off about this and doesn’t like it. I’m like, “Maybe you should put the tiger down.” He figures it out on his own. This whole time, the tiger is the most fascinating thing even though there are other people around. The tiger is acting like a tiger but also like a human. At some point it does come up to me and I just look at it and it looks at me, but I don’t hear anything and it doesn’t give me any verbal messages. I just know we have a moment of looking at each other. This part of the dream dissolves. Now I’m walking through a neighborhood. I’m young, maybe five or six. There are two houses. I go into one house and there are a bunch of younger kids and two dads. I’m now my current age. The moms are not there and the dads don’t know how to feed the kids. They’re both watching tv, but then they see me and are like, “Oh good! A woman to take care of things.” I’m like, “What the fuck? No.” I walk out of the house. Then I walk down the street in this neighborhood -I’m definitely in the suburbs. I walk into the second house. This house is dark and dingy. There’s at least one man in here and maybe some kids. I’m like, “Ew, danger.” I don’t want to be in there. I can tell it’s not the place for me. There’s nothing here for me. This whole time I’m walking through the neighborhood, I’m looking for something but I don’t know what I’m looking for. I do know that this house is not it. I leave that house and go back to the other house. I’m like, “Okay, well I guess I will help you guys out because you’re better than the other house.” They’re like, “Great, we need a pie made.” I go, “Okay, well show me all the stuff.” As soon as I say yes to making the pie, the dads pulls out this box of frozen foods they weren’t feeding the kids until they had permission from me. It’s a box of frozen chicken nuggets and frozen fish sticks and frozen pizzas - basically junk food. They’re like, “Great now we can eat all this stuff and feed the kids.” I’m like, “Ah god, this is a terrible idea. Where is the stuff to make the pie. I’ll make the pie and at least that will be good.” They show me this piece of cardboard with perforated cutouts of leaves and vines. I don’t know what I’m doing with it but I start pushing those through because I think I’ll maybe use them for the pie. Then the dads want to start talking business and how they’re going to pay me for this work. They hand me a leather jump rope with wooden handles. It’s folded four times. I have it in my hands and they’re talking about payment. As I’m listening I think they’ve got it all wrong. They don’t know how much labor is worth or how the pay schedule works. I’m talking about financial investments and using the jump rope to help explain. I’m untying the rope to show them how payment works. This is the most bizarre part of the dream because I don’t remember what I was saying or how a jump rope relates to finance, but somehow it did.",Rose,last_nights_dream
1611,1469,,22/10/2020,10/22/2020 00:05,"I’m in a house and it seems like some kind of celebration. It almost feels like a Christmas Open House or an informal reception of some sort. I’m wandering through the house looking for somebody I know. I don't see anybody when I go through the first three rooms. When I get to the backroom, I see my friend Kenny. He’s sitting with one of his sisters and both of his parents. I’m comfortable with them so I stay there. I don’t mingle. I just have conversations in turn with each of them until the event starts to wind down and the crowd starts to thin. Kenny leaves. I’m still taking to his sister; we’re having a bonding conversation about being the mother of boys. It’s time for her to go home and it’s just the parents left. They ask me if I would like a ride and I accept. I get into the car. I don’t know what happens to the mom, maybe we dropped her off earlier. I’m in the car now with the dad. He says to me, “Is it okay if we stop somewhere because I need to pick something up?” He tells me where it is and I say, “Yes, that’s fine. It’s only five minutes from my house.” We pull up and it’s a really tall apartment building. There’s a circular approach to it and he pulls up the car to the front of the main door. Then he says, “Oh, I didn’t realize you can’t park here. If I stay in the car while it’s running, do you mind going up and getting the parcel?” I say, “No, that’s fine.” He describes to me the floor that it’s on and tells me that I have to go down to the end of the hallway and it’s the last door on the right. He says it should be open. I follow the instructions and end up where he tells me. The door is open. I go into the hallway and see a parcel there and it’s bright orange, the kind of orange you’d see on a construction site. I pick up the parcel and exit the door backwards. I leave my left arm in the doorway, so it doesn’t make a loud noise as it closes. I’m starting to feel strange about being in somebody’s apartment when I don't know them and picking something up when I don’t know what it is. I’m walking down the hallway feeling kind of edgy. I see two people coming towards me from the end of the hallway. I overhear snippets of their conversation and realize they live in the apartment I just exited. I take note of what they look like. It’s a man and a woman. The woman is wearing a long nice pretty dress. They are both brown skin. Her hair is dark and pulled back in a bun. As I start to go down the stairs I’m feeling really unsure about what I’ve just done. When I get to the car, I share this with the dad. Before he answers or addresses my concerns, I see on the front seat of the car a folded up front page of a newspaper. The picture on it is a picture of my face as I’m running away from a building and the headline is “This Place Has Been Robbed!” Now I am really distressed. I’m asking him. He told me it was okay what’s going on here but while I’m talking, he starts driving quickly away. Out from the underground parking lot comes a great big bright yellow ocre Cadillac. It’s the kind of Cadillac really old people drive. It’s really long and wide and doesn’t fit in parking spots anymore. I can see through the front windshield, the same man and woman I met in the hallway. I can hear the sound of the engine of the car roaring to live. It’s driving really quickly. They’re tearing up the road behind us. The dad speeds up and says he thinks he can lose them. He drives through the downtown to the other side of the city where there is a suburban area. It’s a quieter place. You can feel the quiet. It’s dark, nighttime. We drive up a really steep hill and he tells me to get out here and I'll be safe. I don’t know where I am in regards to my own house. I know I don’t feel safe, yet he doesn’t even turn the car off and everything happens so quickly that I feel like I have to get out now and don’t have time to ask questions because the time we gained on the car chasing us might be lost. I feel threatened as if my life is at stake. On the way I told him I wanted to go to the police. I don’t remember if he replied. Everything was happening so quickly. I get out of the car. I don't have the package - it’s not mine and I didn’t want it. I go in between two buildings - it's a really narrow asphalt pathway. Once I get behind the buildings, I’m in a square courtyard with all these big houses backed onto it. I’m standing there in the dark. It’s a quiet cushy kind of feeling there. I think, “Alright, I gotta get my bearings. I don’t have anything with me. How can I get the police and explain what actually happened because I’m being wrongly accused of something I was tricked into doing. Where is a phone? It’s nighttime. I need somewhere to sleep but I don’t know where I’ll be safe.” My eyes adjust to the dark and I see I’m at the top of a hill. At the bottom of the hill is the woman from the hallway and in the car. She looks at me and I can tell that she recognizes me. She looks like she’s getting ready to run up the hill. But I have momentum on my side, so I run down the hill faster and faster and faster. My idea is to tackle her, to take her out, and then keep running until no one can find me. But she guesses what I’m going to do and ducks under. I roll through the air and we both land on our feet. We’re squaring off at each other, circling around and around. This is where I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

We’re strategizing and learning how to get through. We’re on an elevated platform where we can see the tigers. As we go up, I see one of the tigers, a white one, lounging by the megalithic stones. These stones were carved by human hands a long time ago. The tigers were brought in as guardians. There are at least three. We are on the platform learning a dance sequence involving people going in small groups of six or eight at a time, then they pair off. It’s a simple sequence, just holding hands and lifting a leg up, then turning, then lifting the other leg and turning. But you have to do it with precision and the right amount of tension. This is the way to get past the tigers without being attacked. I don’t have anyone to pair off with, so I’m going through the motions by myself. I’m also wary of holding people’s hands.

They’re looking for articles of clothing for a photoshoot. Beth has all these cute pieces, but they look like they’re from a thrift shop - like big floral skirts made out of sheets. I am admiring and remarking on how those two can make anything fashionable, including old sheets, for photoshoots and whatnot. I can also tell I’m in the way, so I’m trying to go through the house and out the front door to my car. Aila is still super hospitable and saying hello. She has other things set up for the kids; I think they’re watching a show or something. The show is a documentary on anti-racism work or something like that.

But it’s still a place where people tie up their boats and get out and into their cars. It kind of looks like a marina in Wilson, New York. My friend has her boat there and she’s sitting at a picnic table with a few other people. There is a riding lawn mower and I get on it because I’ve never sat on one before. She says, “Why don’t you start it up?” I say, “Is it okay?” She says, “Yeah, just start it up the way you would a car.” I see a key in the ignition and I start it. The engine turns over, it’s on, and we’re moving forward. At first i’m just driving it on the grass, just getting used to it. It looks like the grass has been freshly cut, so I’m not making any marks on the grass with it. Then, there’s something in the middle of the grass on a slope - a garden. I see that the grass is taller around the garden and now the lawn mower is leaving marks. So I think it would be irresponsible of me just to have driven this around haphazardly and to ruin the look of it. So I start going up and down the grassed area in an organized way. I’m trying to get close to the garden without cutting the flowers. My friend has now gotten out and gone back to her boat for something. We finished eating at the picnic tables and she’s tidying that stuff up. I realize I need to put the lawn mower back where I found it. There are a couple of spots that look really, really bad now because I didn’t quite finish going up and down properly. So I’m trying to cut across with those spots close to the garden and there’s another one a bit further away. I think I do this...I don’t remember turning the lawn mower off or parking it somewhere. The next thing I remember is I’m in a car. It’s pulling up outside an apartment building and I’ve been sleeping in it. I’m really, really, really tired. I’m in the backseat. Luke is driving. The car stops in front of the apartment building. A few moments later, a boy comes down and he opens the door to the backseat. This is strange because the front seat is empty and I thought he would have sat in the front, but he doesn’t. He sits in the back and now I can’t sleep, so I sit up. He’s laughing at me for sleeping or being in the back seat. He thinks it’s really funny. It’s Luke’s son and I can tell because they have the exact same face. We drive over to Lynn’s house and pull up in the driveway and get out. Luke disappears into the house. I go into the garage, but I go in through the front door. I’ve been gradually moving my stuff over there. Lynn has agreed to lend me her garage for a little while because I have nowhere to live. My son and I are staying there for a little bit. We have piled up cardboard boxes all over the garage. I’ve arranged them in a way so they form almost a full wall. I’ve left a little bit of space between the top of the boxes and top of the garage so light comes in from the rest of the garage. It gives us a place of privacy and a little bit of darkness if we want to sleep. Some time passes by, like three or four weeks. On the other half of the garage, Lynn has set up a gym/spa. She has machines and a room made of cedar strips that you can go in. There's an interesting way of making the cedar room into a sauna by pouring a cup of water into a drawer and then closing the drawer, then out of the spout comes steam. There’s another that releases steam practically through the whole house. She calls that one the steam room and the one with the drawer, the sauna. I run into Luke again - he’s her boyfriend - and he’s in there. He says to me: “It’s time to move out because you can't live here for free.” I feel embarrassed, shocked and surprised that he said this because when I first moved here when Lynn offered, she said it was okay to live there and that’s why I’m there. My job has ended but it was six weeks until I got my payment from it and she said it was okay to pay her rent money at the six week mark when my payments all come in. so, this is why I’m feeling embarrassed, shocked and surprised. I wonder why she told him that I’m living there for free and why he thinks he has to be the muscle and tell me instead of her. So, I leave the spa/gym area on the other half of the garage and go into our boxed off area. I tell my son, “I think we have to leave.” It’s the five and a half week mark and only four more days until I’m supposed to get my money. But I don’t know where else we can go. This is confusing because I don’t know if we just stay for four days or if the dream speeds ahead for four days and we stay there. My money does come in when it’s supposed to. It’s like the money came in an envelope or maybe I went to a bank. I have the money and I’m sorting it out on the floor where I was sleeping. I have a little sleeping bag there. I’m putting the money in piles and saying: “This is for that debt and this is for that debt.” Then I count out Lynn’s money. I go into the house and she’s in the kitchen sitting at the table with Luke. I glare at him and then put the money in front of her and say, “There’s your six weeks of rent just like we agreed.” I don’t stay and talk to her. I turn around and leave the kitchen. My son and I are packing up our stuff. I don’t know where we are going but we’re just not staying there because of how that situation was construed to feel horrible instead of something helpful.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I’m reversed into a parking stall and I’m not sure what kind of car mine is. There’s another call a few stalls down, I think it’s a black Honda Civic. Then a few parking stalls down are a bunch of construction workers working on something. There are cut pieces of wood and sawdust everywhere. I’m not sure what they’re working on but they’re in my psychic space, making noise and part of the dream, but I’m not too focused on them, except trying to make sure I stay out of their way. I’m going through stuff in the trunk of my car. I’m rummaging through it and trying to reorganize everything. I have bags with clothes and shoes and all kinds of things in the car. So I’m trying to find something but also trying to reorganize everything. I’m having a hard time finding stuff and I realize it’s because I’m looking in the other car, my boss’ car, the black Honda Civic. I’m in the trunk of that one. There’s a pair of black high heels with bows on the front - they’re not mine, they’re hers. I’m moving them around and hen I’m like, “Wait a second, no wonder I can’t find anything, I’m in the wrong car.” So I go back to my car and I’m trying to change my shoes or something. My car is broken down. I finish rummaging in the back then go up to this kiosk in the parking lot. It’s a place where you can write a claim so you can get your car fixed. There are a bunch of other people around - a family with some kids and an older lady with white hair. They’ve all already written claims and are waiting for the next step or they’re waiting in line to write their claims. It’s kind of crowded. There’s a younger woman behind the desk at the kiosk. She’s telling everybody what to do, where to go, and what to fill out. She gives me this ticket and I go to fill it out but the ticket is printed wrong. The places where you put your name and address are tilted on the ticket and not in a straight line. And the background of the ticket, instead of being blank has a watermark that is repeated along the whole ticket, so it’s hard to write anything down. I’m looking at the ticket and looking at her and am like, “Is this the thing I need to get my car fixed? Will this help?” This parking for this gigantic building, almost a skyscraper. To the left of the kiosk is this skyscraper and to my right is a hedge. It’s like this is a parking lot where you can park then go walk downtown. I’m noticing the trees. The trees are red, so it’s fall. It’s a somewhat disjointed dream because it’s an urban landscape and I don’t really know why I’m there or what I’m trying to get accomplished. I think I'm trying to get my car fixed. The dream shifts and I’m with Josh and two other people, I’m not sure who they are. We’re in this futuristic seeming town or city. The colors are white and blue, all different shades of lighter blue. I don’t know where we’re going. Josh just decides he’s totally horny and grabs me by the hips and bends me over so he can fuck me from behind. But we’re on the street and on a set of stairs going up to a building. The buildings are low, not skyscrapers. There are no plants anywhere, but if there are, they are shades of white and blue. There’s just this entrance to a building where we stop at. I think that maybe we’re traveling with this other couple but I’m not sure where and I’m not sure what we’re doing.",Rose,last_nights_dream
1643,1472,,28/10/2020,10/28/2020 00:03,"“The Spare Room” This dream is situated in the house that I lied in with my daughter, only it’s empty and I’m the age I am now. I’m moving into it with two girlfriends that I currently work with at the yoga studio. It’s move-in day but we don’t have any furniture, so we’re doing a walk-through. We look through the main floor. It looks clean. The upstairs has three bedrooms, one for everyone. The bathroom looks like it’s in good shape. They stay up on the top floor. They’re looking around in the bedrooms for some specific measurements or something. I go down into the basement. Although the basement looks clean and dry, there’s something creepy in it; it’s an energy that I feel. I walk over to the sliding patio glass doors. I look behind the blinds. I see an old man there. He’s gardening. I ask him if he needs anything. He says, “No, I’m good thanks.” He’s in the backyard on the other side of the glass and I’m on the inside. I look down to see what he’s doing. He has a toolbox and he’s fixing something. I ask him if he’s going to need to come into the house. He replies in a voice like, “Oh no no, I would never go in there.” I think he knows something about this creepy energy in the basement. Then I go back upstairs to the main floor. The other two girls are starting to bring in boxes and furniture. I’m helping with that, bringing in my own stuff. We each set up our bedrooms then go downstairs. They’re having trouble arranging the furniture in the living room. A couple pieces are mine, a couple pieces belong to each one of them and we’re just trying to group them together. I look at what they have and say, “Hmm, it’s funny that this won’t fit because when I used to live here, I had the same pieces of furniture and they all fit just fine.” So we keep rearranging and put the couch on another wall and arranging the other stuff around it. We try this on three different walls when I say, “Wait a minute, I know why this isn’t fitting! That one wall that goes from the main hallway downstairs to the stairs that go up is shorter than it used to be! What’s going on with that?” So I open the door to the closet. Now there’s a closet on that same wall. For some reason we haven’t put anything in it, nor did we open it when we did our inspection. I open it up and it’s giant. Then I close it again and look on the outside of the wall and say, “Oh that’s why nothing will fit there! Somebody has removed part of the wall in order to make this closet twice as large.” Then we open the closet door again and this time there is a single bed, a dresser, and a couple of low tables in there. There’s a light from the ceiling. I say, “I wonder if they had this set up as an Airbnb room?” One of the other girls says, “Or maybe they just needed an extra bedroom?” Then we close the closet door again. I notice that there is a clothing bar running down the length of the ceiling. I think I say out loud, “I wonder where we can put our coats?” Then between the three of us we decide that since we only each have one coat, we can find room for it in our own closets upstairs. Then I open the closet door one more time because I want to check the workmanship to see if this has been a hack job or if it will stay as another bedroom. I’m kind of entertaining the idea of an Airbnb room in mind. But this time when I open it up there’s a little tiny crib along with the single bed and dresser. I’m wondering what happened to this person or the baby. It kind of looks like they still live here. Then I’m starting to wonder if there’s a connection between that and the presence in the basement that I feel. I’m still thinking about this as I go back upstairs to unpack more things in the bedroom. Then I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

In my mind's eye I was staring at the text in my quiz book.   I thought about offering to be a coach instead and letting another quizzer join, but then I was shown the list of quizzers and found that it was against the rules to bring anyone else on. If I left I would be hurting the team. I also noticed that there weren't many great quizzers on the list with Miley Twig being one of them.   I was in a hallway outside of where P. M. was. We were about to head out together. I was speaking with a person about the way training worked and how it took up to 5 hours every other weekend. Then I remembered that it was actually a full weekend and the other person thought that was too much.  I left in a church van with P. M. and the other quizzers making some joke where I addressed P. M. by his first name as an equal. I wasn't quite sure if I should have called him by his first name. Once in the van I realized that we were heading to P.M.'s church and that my parents had no idea where I was going. I I couldn't get a hold of them.

1648,962,,29/10/2020,10/29/2020 00:01,"I am walking through a downtown area. The streets are dark and wet. I’m looking for a hotel restaurant and spa. I find it and it’s larger and more elegant on the inside than it appears on the outside. I go to the concierge to make an appointment at the spa. They tell me to wait in the lobby and come back when they call my name. I look over the different treatment options on the spa menu. There are only women here - it’s a women only spa. I see Rose who I think is applying for a job here as a sexocological bodyworker and some other women I don’t recognize from waking life. After some time passes, they call me up to the desk. They give me a large ticket printed on brown cardstock. It has my name on the front and information for my first time. Then they give me my assigned therapist who will give me my treatment. They lead me to the back. I go down the stairs behind them. Instead of going directly to the spa, I go to the restaurant. It’s huge with tall ceilings. People are spaced out at different tables. I sit at my assigned table. A couple other people join me. I look at the menu and the food is unusual - fine dining breakfast/brunch. I order. The food arrives and it’s a crystallized strawberry fluff. It’s delicious. The person across from me is a chef and she’s talking about how she makes a strawberry ice cream. She gets the largest strawberries and cuts them in slices and places them together to make something like a boat. She makes the ice cream from scratch. The other person sitting next to me says, “Yeah, it’s the most wonderful thing you’ve ever had!” She promises me an invitation to a dinner party at her home. I love the idea of going to a chef’s home for dinner. Meanwhile, the spa therapists are coming around and finding the people they recognize for their treatments - there are a lot of regulars here and I might be the only new person. I’m assigned to a person named Shannon. I think they are a woman. This person comes down and everyone knows and loves her. She is one of the most sought after therapists. She is being discreet, looking around for her client, not calling out names, because we are all supposed to be anonymous here. Then she starts singing a song about herself because we don’t recognize each other. Now I realize that she identifies as “they.” They are tall, brown skin with big black hair, very lean and strong. I realize, “This is Shannon.” I try to get their attention once they complete their song. Most of the others have gone to receive their treatment. I reach into my bag to get my ticket. I can’t find it at first and am concerned that I won’t be able to receive my session without it. It’s tucked in between notebooks and other papers. I take it out and show them my name and their name printed on the ticket. We go out and I don’t recall the treatment. Afterwards, I’m on a beach. My dad is sitting on a beach chair next to me. There’s another older man sitting next to him and some young adults in their late twenties sitting on a surfboard in front of us. My dad comments on one of the gals wearing a little bitty red one piece swimsuit. Her body is very young and firm. My dad talks to the old man next to him, assuming the young woman is this old man’s girlfriend. He tells the old man how lucky he is. I’m disgusted by the conversation between them. I get up and walk to the shore. I see small creatures digging holes in the sand after the waves go out. I dig a hole and am finding crawdads and am pulling them out while trying to avoid their claws. I look out at the ocean. The water is so clear. I see turtles and then this creature. At first I think the creature is another turtle, but when I look more closely, it’s like a dolphin with an elephant trunk. I point it out to people. We realize that the young woman who the men were talking about is the fiancee of the older man’s son.

They’re all putting in their orders and are very expectant. It’s just me. And there’s one other person who’s watching me and helping me a little, waiting for my direction, but more observing. I’m panicked because there’s too much to do. There’s no way to cook and serve and clear the tables and get everyone’s order and fill the water glasses all at the same time. It’s just too much. I’m trying as hard as I can. Everything is white in this restaurant - white table cloths, white walls, white floor - and part of it seems outdoors, there is no ceiling.

She’s in costume. There are a bunch of other ice skaters who are her teammates. They’re on the ice in the background. Then there’s one male ice skater. The others are all lined up and my daughter is in front of them. The one male ice skater comes around and as part of the show pulls her jacket off down around her arms and her body is that of a full grown woman. It’s a very sexual sensual move and I’m pissed off because she’s still a thirteen year old and she’s being super hyper sexualized in this show. I’m so mad. Her coaches are there critiquing because it is a rehearsal for the show. My daughter skates forward to do her move and something happens that I don’t quite see and she falls to the ice. Something happens to one of her legs. I’m so mad and I go grab her to make sure she’s okay. But this is not an appropriate show for a young girl to be doing. Then everybody goes home. I have her and her brother, too. Their dad is there, too. He’s been watching. I’m trying to spend time with the two kids because I haven’t seen them in a long time. I gather them both up in my arms and hold onto them and snuggle them. Their dad leaves and gives me some time with me. I try to connect. It’s a little awkward but there is some connection. He’s saying, “It’s time to go,” and he takes the kids with him. I’m following them out. We head out of the building where the ice skating rink is. Now I’m in this marina, so there are boats and everyone has a dock for their boats. The boats are coming back and forth, but people are also swimming in the water. There are set times when there are no boats and people can swim. Then there is time for the boats when you can’t swim because you’d get run over. I’m showing some of the kids in our group how to swim. I’m not sure who all is with us. A few people in their boats start to go boating when it’s still swimming time. People are yelling at the swimmers to get out of the water so they don’t get run over. I see this boat coming right up the lane and I flatten myself as much as I can on the floor of the marina - I think it’s a lake floor - so I don’t get chopped up by their propellers. I get up and people start dragging me out of the water once the boat passes over. I’m horrified that no one is being careful and that we’re in the water while boating is happening. We get out of the water. Somebody’s wedding is being prepped and they’ve asked me as a friend to come and help with it. Each of their friends are taking turns helping with the wedding. I think each of us has a day that we’re helping to prep. I get my day and I have a list. I don’t know who these friends are and I don’t even know who the friends of the friends are. It's a very strange situation because I don't know who I was just partying with at the marina and I don’t know whose wedding this is. I get a list of all the things that have been assigned to me to prep for this wedding. I walk through this door that will be the aisle we walk down, but the timing is bad because when we walk through it sets off an alarm that downs a bunch of trees right over the entrance and blocks it. It’s like when a castle is under siege and you’re pulling oil over people’s heads. The building or place has a protection mechanism; it reminds me of Hogwarts in the last movie. So all these trees come down right in front of me. The couple who is getting married is like, “There goes my aisle to walk down.” I go, “Well, I’ll clean up the trees and the other people can do the other stuff on the list.” I go to do that, but I think I get interrupted. Someone stops me to help them with something, but I go, “Yeah, but I really have to move these trees.” The trees were dead to begin with and they weren’t actually trees, they were really big logs that have come across this doorway. The doorway is little; it’s like a one person doorway that you would go in and out of, say through your bedroom or something. But there is a red carpet that leads out from it, but now it’s covered in logs. These logs are white, either birch or aspen that have been cut and fallen. This dream ends with me being pulled away from this job to assist the bride. I’m sitting in a circle on a bench and there’s a woman with a white dress on. Her train is huge and beautiful.

1662,964,,01/11/2020,11/01/2020 00:05,"Magical university library. A thin woman in her sixties with short grey hair. She is a librarian. She was once a student but didn’t finish her studies because of the danger to her family. She stays close to the students and books, quietly watching out for them and absorbing all of the information in the Records. This is a university in the sky. A younger woman, a student, feels something, knows something. She is at the library searching for safety in knowledge. The older woman steps out from behind the bookshelves and her silent observation to assist. They are both now falling/flying through the clouds. Now, darkness on a river, water black because of night. The older woman is there but no longer directly involved. The younger woman is in the river with the men. So much activity. Men are being trained for dangerous physical labor. She is in with them. Huge pumpkins and watermelons are being poured into the water. They have to sort them quickly so they need to be as close as possible, but that means they are in danger of their heads being smashed and their bodies drowned. Once sorted, the pumpkins and melons float down the river. She is floating alongside a man now. The man has also just arrived and is being trained. They have separated from the rest. They look down and see far below them a family of orcas. They are trying to be as still as possible as they stay afloat. They don’t want the orcas to notice them, but they also know they’ve been seen. More orcas arrive. There are so many and the water is so deep! To their right, the rest of the people are now skimming by on extremely fast pointed black boards. Those people know the dangers of the water and have been properly trained and prepared. The young woman and man see a way out to the left. The river is swift, but they are able to climb out. But there will be consequences for leaving their work. Their feet are on concrete and there is a concrete wall that they run along. They think they'll be free, but as they turn, they see a red gate, locked. There’s no way out except by the river.",Ana,last_nights_dream2

The scene shifts from me looking at my phone to being at a coffee shop. I’m with Josh and we’re hanging out. I have this feeling that Hank is going to meet up with me here and Wend6 is going to be there, too. I don’t want to meet up with them and don’t know why I agreed to meet with them.

She’s actually really happy and her hair is dyed blond. She has a smile on her face. She says hi to me. I’m wary like who is this and why is she saying hi. But she says hi then goes on with her business. She has her kids and she’s meeting a friend. Hank shows up and goes to give me a creepy hug like he used to give me.

There’s a chair on the other side of the table facing him and the chair is where I was going to sit, but that’s where Hank wants to sit and talk. I have all this hesitation about meeting up with them. Then the scene shifts and I’m in a Jeep. I'm driving around. It’s either Wendy’s or somebody’s. Josh is in the passenger seat and he’s upset and is like, “Why did you meet with them?” I don’t remember the gist of the conversation, just the feeling that he wasn’t happy with me and I was confused that I would agree to meet with them and confused by their super friendly reaction to me when I don’t think they would be friendly in real life.",Rose,last_nights_dream

I don’t have to be there because I know what it’s all about. Even though it’s mandatory for me to take the test, I choose not to go to the class. I get to the classroom and everyone has taken the test. I don’t recognize any of them. They’re at their desks and the teacher is standing up at the front of the classroom with a blackboard or whiteboard behind them. I go to take the test and the teacher is like, “I don’t know how well you’re going to do because you weren’t even here for the lecture.” I’m like, “I’m going to be fine because I know this material, it’s pretty common sense, and I’m creative.” We go to take the test and sure enough, it’s something I can totally do. I pass everything. In another part of the dream I’m with a little girl. We’re on an adventure together but it's a little bit creepy because no matter where we are, it’s just us two. I think there is a dog. We’re doing things like jumping rock formations with one a little above the other and the drop is at least a hundred feet with lava underneath, like in a video game. We’re moving through this landscape. At one point we sit down to try and feed the dog. I think there are people or things chasing us. We have a mission. Scene change: I’m walking through a neighborhood at night. I’m walking down this street. The houses on the left are up higher than the houses on the right and the street runs through the middle. The houses on the left, when you look at them, the windows are facing out towards the view and there is landscaping in the front. The houses on the right are lower and that’s the entrance with fences and archways and little cement steps onto the porches. So it’s like I’m looking at the front of the houses to my right and the back of the houses to my left. They’re all really fancy. Everything is dressed up for Halloween so there’s decor, cobwebs, pumpkins and skeletons everywhere. As I go down the street, I finally get to a part with a dedicated walkway with stairs and handrails that lead down. I start to walk down and on the left hand side is a gorgeous inn that looks like a historical landmark. It’s all red with a ton of windows and white shutters. I can tell the color even in the dark.",Rose,last_nights_dream

I’m in every room in her house. I'm in the living room and there’s stuff there, then I’m in the kitchen and there’s stuff there, then I’m up in the attic and there’s stuff there. There’s a whole other apartment’s worth of stuff in each room. Every room has everything in it that she’s ever had since she was a kid and it’s all just everywhere. It’s a mess and it’s not sorted. She hasn’t packed any of it into boxes and she’s asking me to help her, but she’s not ready. It’s a mess. It’s like trying to pack something that just keeps unpacking itself. At one point in the dream, I’m in the attic and my friend is there. It’s not like she’s helping, she’s just sitting there and she’s talking. Her mood is light and she’s making me laugh about a few things. At one point, there is a stack of toys that my daughter has had since she was a kid. They’re the toys she had between the ages of three and five. They’re in this big cube the height of my body and the same width. The cube is made of the toys. I’m reaching in and at first I’m pulling out things that are just garbage and I’m putting them in the garbage bag. Then I see a six-pack of bottles that I think are sparkling water. I pull that out because it doesn’t belong with the toys. My friend says, “That’s not sparkling water. Look, read the ingredients.” I’m looking at it and she says, “There’s tequila in it. I think you should have some of that. Let’s do it!” She pulls out two of the bottles and screws of the caps. We both take a swig and it doesn’t take like tequila, it just tastes like regular sparkling water. In the back of my mind I'm thinking that I don’t really want to do this because I won’t be present for what I’m packing. Then I realize that maybe that’s silly because I’m just packing and maybe I don’t need to be as present as I am with it. I take another swig. It doesn’t really affect me.

1694,1475,,07/11/2020,11/07/2020 00:02,"“Braids” I’m in a large crowd of people. Somebody that I’m working for has instructed me to make sure that no one’s hair is in their eyes. I’ve got this kit that has different things that can be braided into people’s hair and fastened so the braids don’t come out. There are quite a few different pieces and lots of different colors, so that no matter what color anyone’s hair is or what color their skin is, the braids will look attractive and match their own personal style. When I first start doing this I’m using a chart because some people have been sick. I’m in a white sterile type of environment. I kind of move through there braiding the hair of those I kind. It’s one long white room packed with people shoulder to shoulder. It’s kind of hard to maneuver around and do what I’m supposed to do. As I complete this task, the room leads into another room that is dark with no lights on. So instead of being really bright and whiite, it’s dark but also more colorful. There’s a stage and people are performing some kind of music up on the stage. It’s an open mic night, so it could be anybody. There isn't a full band, just one person at a time performing. While this is going on, I’m on the lower level around whoever is watching and doing their hair. Then I complete the braids of the people I’m supposed to. The next person is a guy that’s just finishing performing. He’s sitting off to the side of the stage. More people are coming from the audience and sitting on the side so you can hardly see where the stage is. It’s also dark. I’m wondering what I’m going to do with his hair because he has a scarf around his head, his hair is inside of it and he’s wearing a hat on top of that. I tell him what I’m here to do and he says, “Okay. I don’t know what you want me to do with it though.” I say, “Well what would you like?” He says, “Well, I’m pretty happy with it the way it is.” I say, “Okay, that’s fine. Do you want me to just put a couple of pieces around the temples?” He takes the hat off and removes the scarf. His hair is all in cornrows. One of them is binding all of them into one large ponytail. I’m wondering why I’ve been instructed to do his hair, it’s perfectly fine the way it is. So I just try and wrap the scarf around his head the way it was and fasten it a little more sturdily. While I’m doing this, I see my ex-best friend. She’s taking the stage and jumping up and down and waving her arms around, but that’s all she’s doing. She’s not singing anything, she doesn’t have any talent, she’s just jumping up and down trying to get people to look at her. Then I see her family coming up to watch her, but the parents have had two more children. I think, “Wow, the mom is over fifty. The youngest is probably going to be orphaned soon. I wonder how fair that is to have kids at that age?” When her family arrives, she stops jumping up and down and pretends to be limping as though she’s sick. Everyone is rushing over to her and saying, “What’s wrong? Are you okay?” I feel like oh there she goes again doing her antics. I don’t go over and speak to them. I pick up the things I was using for the hair. I say goodbye and thank you to the guy who had basically undid his perfectly good hair and let me touch it and do something with it that wasn’t even useful and then he put it back together himself. I walk back through the crowd. Now I look down. I’m sure I was completely dressed when I started this, but now I’m wearing a tanktop that’s one of those old man’s undershirts. My own underwear is white and baggy like an old man’s. I feel exposed and naked. I’m not comfortable with this. I don’t even want anyone to see me. I’m trying to shoulder my way back through the crowd and stay in the dark. I go into the washroom which is part of another big room - it’s somebody’s bedroom. It’s a really messy bedroom with clothes all over the place. I’m hoping I can find something to put on.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I saw now that it was an old fashioned gumball machine filled with red gumballs about two inches in diameter.   My hand brushed up against one of the buttons and the machine turned on and its loud fans began to spin. I was afraid it would break as it wasn't fully working yet so I reached behind the washing machine and pulled the black plug from the wall. The machine stopped running.  My mom entered the room and I explained what had happened. We moved outside where my mom told me that she was planning on selling the machine on Craigslist for two hundred to three hundred dollars. We stared at the machine outside. It was red now and had become much larger. I offered to take it or buy it from my mom since it was such a cool antique.

We ran quickly and found one of them which we sent home. We tracked another to a fork in the road. One path turned right and looked easy, the other went steeply up hill. William and I inspected the ground by each trail to see if we could see tracks to indicate which direction the horse took. I thought I saw tracks leading right though something made me think this was wrong. We ran incredibly quickly and I noticed that I wasn't wearing a shirt and my pajama pants were so loose they were falling off.   We rounded a corner and ran across a group of people hiking with their dogs. There were some buildings and grassy fields nearby. We asked if they had seen any horses but they had not.   We returned and ended up by the main road by the gorge. I saw the waterfall to the right of the dam and realized I had never seen it before. The road went over the water and up to the top of the dam. We were driving in my brother's car now and I was afraid that he was going to drive off the edge and drown us. I could tell that he was depressed. We for to the top and found that it was a rollercoaster that my brother had built. I wasn't sure it was safe, but we for into a car together, buckled in and shot down quickly gaining speed. We rounded corners jolting against the sides of the track. At the bottom we entered the water and began floating toward the stone wall near the waterfall. I was afraid we would sink and unbuckled, but William convinced me the car was buoyant so I rebuckled and we floated forward but we did eventually sink to the bottom.

I move myself to a table at the edge of the restaurant so I’m out of the way while I try to put all my jewelry back on. I’m just watching as everyone gets ready. They’re all interacting with each other, laughing and playing and having a good time while they do their work. I feel kind of awkward the whole time because they’re not even open yet and here I am. The servers, men and women, talk with me and interact with me. I find myself remembering what it was like when I used to be a server and wondering how much they make in tips in cash each night and what they do with it - whether or not they report the cash tip or just the credit card tips to avoid taxes being taken out. The restaurant finally opens. I have a flash of seeing a football team playing a game from this table where I’m at. I look out of the restaurant over a field to where the football players are playing a game. I’m still trying to find my earrings and I can't find them. I’m trying to fit the big antique ring with the huge diamond and the smaller diamonds around it on my finger but I can’t quite get it on. All the rings are on my left hand and on all the fingers except my thumb. I’m trying to fit this older antique ring over my wedding ring finger and I don’t quite get it on, but I’m holding onto it so I don’t lose the ring.",Rose,last_nights_dream

So Ed said she wanted to go, so she got ready to go. But suddenly a snake appeared and my older brother killed it, then another and he could not kill it and that one sneaked away and tried to hide so they gave me a pretty boy, with light eyes and blonde to go with him, I was scared , and I said I needed that snake to be killed to be at peace. They did not kill it because my brother could only hit it in the tail part, and she seemed to make fun of us, then another appeared, through the dining room (the whole house looked like my grandmother's, only that it had two floors in the part of the bedrooms). Then they killed that one and I saw a hen along with the child at the top, but since we could not turn on the lights, we went back down and while we went down, in the distance we saw the snake that they had not managed to kill, in the ranch go to the stove, and we told my brother and mother and there the dream remained.",Rosa,Last Night's Dream

I can clearly see the bright orange ember glow of the fire spreading across the ridge. I’m with a man who I know but I can’t recall his name right now. We are deciding whether to stay here or not. We’re watching the way the fire is spreading. We decide to wait a while longer because my husband is supposed to meet us here. As we wait and watch, the fire continues to grow. It looks like it’s coming down our side of the mountain towards us. Suddenly, it’s not just a fire, it’s red lava flowing down the mountain. We realize the mountain is actually an active volcano. We get into the RV and even though it’s mine, I don’t know how to drive it. The man gets in the driver’s seat and he’s only driven an RV of this size maybe once. He gets behind the wheel and is driving as quickly and safely as he can down this rough dirt road to get us away from the fire and lava. We can feel its heat. We know there are other people in the woods who we were supposed to meet up with and we hope they’re finding a way out..",Ana,last_nights_dream1

We’re at the rental car place to get cars for the group. There are so many of us that we’re taking multiple cars. I watch four of us get a car and talk to the rental car agent and get in the car and drive off. There’s another four of us waiting for a car. I’m hoping for a Toyota Tacoma to drive because that would be a lot of fun. So the rental car agent comes back and walks the four of us to our car. Sure enough, it’s a Tacoma. There’s another woman in the group with me and two men. The woman wants to drive and I’m like no way, because the Toyota Tacoma is my favorite car, so I’m the driver. I have the rental agent put my name on as the driver and I get the keys and we all get in. I went to drive the truck and I’ve forgotten how bouncy trucks are. For some reason I’m scared that the brakes on this truck don’t work very well. I’m going really slow as I pull out of the parking lot which looks like an underground garage. I can tell everyone in the car is annoyed that I’m driving so slow, but I don’t think the brakes work super well so I’m not going to drive super fast. We drive off the lot but I don’t remember where we go. The dream shifts and I’m with a bunch of people. There's a black guy who’s a DJ. Again, I don’t recognize anyone. I think I’m stirring a pot of soup. The guy is playing music and helping me cook or at least putting in his two cents about how it should be cooked. It’s uncomfortable for me because I’m trying to cook and he’s playing music, and I’m not trying to tell him how to play music. I don’t know who’s dancing but there are people dancing. We are outside. The pot I’m stirring is huge. At one point I think I put everything down so I can dance. It’s really good music and it’s a lot of fun. But then there’s another interaction between him and me. When I put the ladle down to dance, he picked it up. Then the dream fades and I don’t remember anything else.",Rose,last_nights_dream
1716,1476,,11/11/2020,11/11/2020 00:05,"“Deja Vu” The dream starts where I’m having a dream that I’ve had before. I’m in a different country, I think the UK. I’m walking down a street. It’s raining lightly and it’s dark. There are street lamps that are gas powered - the old wrought iron kind about nine feet high. The streets are made of cobblestone and are a bit slick. I walk through the streets. There are some people around and they’re wearing overcoats and bonnets. The men are wearing hats with a brim in the front and back. The overcoats have a top layer that comes from the neck and goes over the shoulders to the waist. I walk for a while then I come to the place where I know I’m supposed to go. I open the front door and walk up the stairs to the second floor and knock on the door. My boyfriend from high school opens the door. Inside, he’s got art easels and papers and paints and everything strewn around. There are plates with unfinished food. His kids look like they’ve been there but they aren’t there right now. I clear a space for myself to sit down. He’s not really looking at me. He’s opened the door but he hasn’t stopped what he’s doing to ask me why I’m there or greet me. I know this is typical of him, this is how he works. So I just sit and look out the window until he’s finished with what he’s doing. It feels like it takes ten minutes. Then, I don’t even know what he says to me. There’s just a break in the focus. I ask him how he’s been. I know I’m there because there’s something wrong with him but he doesn’t know this yet. Rather than say anything, he gestures with his arm that he’s been doing all this. He leaves the room and goes to a corner with a pile of stuff. He comes back with something and he shows me sketches. They’re quite good. It seems like he’s been working on this project. He starts to get his coat on. I know we’re leaving out the door to go somewhere else. We go back out onto the street. We’re going in the opposite way that I came and we go in through another door. It’s crowded and I don’t know anyone here, but he does. I’m waiting for him to finish doing what he has to do here so that I can talk to him. While he’s talking to a group of people, I’m looking at some things on a table. There’s a deck of cards. I take the cards in my hand and shuffle them. Then I lay eight out on the table. I turn over the fourth one and it’s hand-drawn like a cartoon style. The card shows a group of people. I hold it up and see that one of them is my high school boyfriend. I look and it’s a card that shows him sitting in the booth where he’s sitting surrounded by the people that are there including the ones that have their backs to me and the ones that are silhouetted. I put that card back down on the table. Then I turn up another one. It’s his apartment when he was younger before his hair was grey. It’s drawn in cartoon style. The drawings are done in a black marker, so they’re black and white illustrations. This one shows him younger working on these projects. So now I don’t want to turn any more cards over until I've had a chance to talk to him. I keep the ones that are still in my hand in my hand. I’m just waiting for him to finish. I can hear the hum of voices but I’m not really listening or trying to pull any conversation out. I’m just waiting and kind of disengaged because I’m focused on something else. Time passes, maybe a half hour, and he’s finished. He comes over. I know we can leave now. I show him the first card I turned over where he is the age he is now. He looks at it and pauses. Then I say to him, “These look like your drawings. Did you draw these cards? Did you illustrate them?” I know as soon as I say it that he did. He looks thoughtful. Then I gather up the cards and take them with us. We walk back to his apartment. I sit down again. He goes back to his easel, his drawing board, and begins to draw. I know I’ve seen this before and have been here many times. Then the dream flips a switch. I’m at some kind of get together or dance. I see his parents. His mom is all excited because he’s coming home. She asks me if I’ve seen him yet. I say, “No I haven’t.” She says, “Well, you should come by.” I think she gives me a date. She says, “Come by and have some snacks with us.” I tell her that I will. I do. His family is there. I spend some time talking with his sisters. It’s joyous. It feels like Christmas. I’m talking to one of his brothers. I know I should tell him something, but I don’t get the chance because there’s so much talking and too many people around. Then he’s gone and he’s gone back to the UK.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream1
1717,1477,,11/11/2020,11/11/2020 00:06,"“Car Pooling” I’m in a town that looks like modern suburbia. I’m driving a car. I come down a street and it’s like a keyhole where you have to turn around eventually. There’s some parallel parking up by the curb. I go around the keyhole and pull up so I’m facing the same way that I came in. I get out of the car. I walk down a little walkway that goes in between two houses. I walk past the houses and to another row of houses behind that have no street access. I go into the front door. It belongs to one of my yoga teacher training students. There are a couple of kids in there and other students from my teacher training. She gets her things together. We both walk out of her house to my car. We drive the car around to a different street that looks very much like the street we were just on. We drive to the end of the keyhole and get out. We go into a building that feels like a university. I don’t remember what we do. We come back out and get into the car and drive back to her house. I park in the same space that I did before. This time when we go into her house, there are a lot more people in it. There’s a tall man wearing glasses. I can’t see the color of his eyes. He has strawberry blond hair brushed straight back from his face, it’s shoulder length. He’s talking to me about something but I don’t remember what it was. There are a couple of students from my yoga teacher training who are still there and some small kids under the age of five. One of the kids is a one year old with a very bright alert face. He’s crawling then grabbing a piece of furniture to pull himself up to standing, taking a couple of steps, then plunking down and crawling again. He’s circulating around to all the people, using their knees to pull himself up. He’s making non-verbal but very animated sounds. He looks at me with this very piercing eyes that look like a much older adult. As he’s making these rounds, he gets to me. He has this charisma. I’m quite fascinated with his charisma. You know how kids when they want to be picked up but don’t have any speech, they just reach with their arms? He does this. I pick him up. He uses one arm to point. I know he’s using me as legs so he can’t get to the other side of the room. He has some kind of agenda. So I stand up and take him over. He’s pointing at the sink and wants the sink. I shift him down a bit so I’m hoisting him up with my hips. He’s leaning over the sink and his feet aren’t touching the ground. He wants to play with the water. I’m looking around and don’t know which of the people are his parents. Nobody looks like they own him. Nobody is alarmed that he’s at the sink. Nobody is making any kind of awareness at all, so I guess it’s fine. I turn the tap on and he’s playing with the water with his hands. It’s one of those great big farmhouse style sinks so it’s pretty deep. There’s a plastic container beside the sink. For some reason, the floor is under his feet and he’s really stable so quite safe to stay there. I leave him there for a second to get a towel. I turn around for about three seconds. In those three seconds, he gets the plastic container and it has oil or something in it. I look at it and think there was Vitamin D in it. He’s found an eyedropper and he’s made a pattern with the Vitamin D all over the sink and on the tap and stuff. I’m thinking, “Yup, leave it to a baby to create a giant mess in one second.” I’m wondering if I should wipe this up or maybe it’s good that it’s there because it’s Vitamin D. I take my own hand and am doing the same thing he’s doing - massaging the Vitamin D onto the sides of the sink, coating it. I know that it’s getting into us through our skin. Then I realize that the students that are talking are sharing dreams. I wonder how I missed that and I don’t want to miss it. I think I pick the baby up and put him on my lap, but then he disappears into the dream and I’m sitting where I was when I picked him up originally. I hear Cora talking about something in her dream. Her hair is short. I’m listening to Meg talking about her dream. She’s talking about a dream where Cora cuts her hair off. I feel like I want to interrupt because it’s the exact same dream I had last night where Cora cuts her hair. She had really, really long brown hair. Then of course we're both sitting looking at Cora with short hair. The whole group realizes that Meg and I had the same dream in advance of Cora cutting her hair. Then I’m not sure that Cora cut her hair because we had the dream. So I’m thinking about this and not saying anything, just mulling it over in my mind. Then Meg’s boyfriend starts talking about a dream he had. Meg is saying that they’re not co-sleeping well together because he makes so much noise. I say to her: “What about if you bring an iPod to bed and play ambient music through the earbuds?” She says, “I tried that but he doesn’t like it when I do that.” So I’m thinking this is a little bit of a stonewall; he snores so loudly that she can’t sleep but won’t let her do any of the things that prevent her from hearing. So they’re both telling me these things and I’m thinking that maybe I should tell them the story of how the double bed came into being. I say, “Do you know that the double bed actually isn’t very old? It only came into being for economic reasons a short while ago. People slept in separate beds and couples would have a courtship dance of inviting each other into their rooms. They would either send a runner with an invitation or they would leave hints, dropped like flower petals. It made your sex life so much more exciting to have this dance aheadof time.” Meg looks really excited about it. The boyfriend looks a bit skeptical but I can tell that he’s interested. I think I’ll just leave the rest to them and I get up and walk away. I’m trying to figure out whose house I’m in and who all these people are. As I rejoin the other conversation, Cora is saying that they grew up in the house in the front where I parked my car. Her brother, the guy with the strawberry blond hair whose eyes I can’t see, bought the house beside this one first. When she was old enough to move out, she bought this one. I think this is why there’s no access road, the family has just divided their property. I think it is so nice to be this close and spend time in each other’s houses but walk in and out. I think this is similar to the sleeping arrangement where you have your own space but are surrounded by family. I feel really glad to be part of this grouping if even for a moment. It feels really, really good.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream2

1724,1478,,12/11/2020,11/12/2020 00:06,"“Board Games and Cereal” I’m leaving my house with a board game. It’s resting against my hip and I’ve got my left hand around the box to keep it closed. I’m holding it vertical to the ground, not parallel with it. It’s already been opened and played so every so often I have to check to be sure the bottom hasn’t created an opening between the top and the pieces haven’t fallen out. It’s old and the box doesn’t hold it’s shape very well because it’s cardboard and gets soft after a while. So I’m holding it this way. I walk out of my home and have my daughter and son with me. There’s somebody else but I can’t remember who it is now. We don’t have any front steps and it’s like a ramp. It actually feels like I’ve left a movie theatre. We turn right and go down the sidewalk. There’s a long line of stores. We’re walking slowly because there are so many people we know and we keep stopping to talk. So we only take about two steps and there’s somebody else and we stop to talk again. We eventually go three or four stores down and there’s somebody else I know. They’re trying to control a crowd of window shoppers because some are trying to make a purchase and some are just standing around and are getting in the way. My family and I stop to help. I set the board game down by the cash register. The store owner has brought everything outside in order to avoid people going in the shop and making a big crowd in there. Part of the issue is that no one browsing is wearing a mask and none are social distancing. Then I realize that my family and I don’t have masks on either. I note this and say, “Well, no wonder! Nobody is wearing a mask!” We take ours out of our pockets and put them on our faces. Then I’m trying to get people to form a line and I tell them, “The cash register is over there and you have to line up.” Gradually people realize they should be social distancing so they’re starting to self-organize. I take a turn at the cash register. They’re giving me cash. It’s not debit. I’m questioning this. The store owner comes back having finished organizing what she wanted to organize. She says, “Thank you so much, I can take it from here.” I pick up my board game again. I see Julie, who I used to work with at the restaurant. I realize I’m wearing a hat, glasses and a mask and she’s probably not going to recognize me. She’s talking to somebody else I know who calls me over into the conversation. I say, “Do you know who I am?” She’s looking like she might. I take my hat off first and then I just take one of the loops of the mask from my ear quickly. She says my name and I put the mask and hat back on. She gives me a big hug and says, “I haven’t seen you in so long.” I say, “Yeah, I’ve aged. You look fantastic.” I wait. She tells me about her life. This goes on for a little bit. I wonder if she’s going to tell me about her three boys. She tells me she’s in a new relationship. We say goodbye and she leaves. I notice that a piece from the board game, a house, is moving. It’s escaped from the box and is flying around. I shout this: “Oh no! The house piece is on the move!” My kids are trying to catch it. They crawl underneath a cart that shopkeepers put out on the sidewalk for the day - it has legs and a bin and is made of wire. They’re crawling under these and one of them catches the piece and puts it back in the box. I’m feeling like we’ve been gone from the house too long. We turn around and start to make our way back home. I see somebody else on the sidewalk. There’s a stand up display that a man is hiding behind. He’s peeking to the person standing on the sidewalk. The person on the sidewalk is describing to us a little fearfully that somebody is spying on them. I don’t understand why they’re scared because it’s just somebody looking at them through a natural gap between the displays. I approach the guy that’s been accused of spying and say, “Hey, how are you?” He says he’s good and he says, “Look. I can see the entire street through this little tiny gap.” I say, “Yeah, that’s amazing.” He’s got pajamas over his clothes, but just the legs of pajamas. He’s wearing them like chaps, only they don’t have a belt. I say, “This is interesting, what you have on your legs. May I ask what the purpose of it is?” He tells me it’s just a creative idea he had for dressing and he just likes it that way. It’s not for protection or anything like that. I say, “Yes, it’s very interesting.” Now the other person who was freaking out and accusing him of spying has been deflated and has stopped having a fit about it. The person that was accused, he was walking around and describing how he made these pajama bottom legs. He’s not peeking through the thing anymore. I guess that’s why the other person is okay now. Pajama-bottoms guy walks the opposite way and the other person continues across the street. Then I notice that the pieces of the board game are moving, they’re vibrating a lot. I’m saying to my kids, “We really have to get home now or we’re going to lose control of these things and they’re going to fly out all over the place.” As I’m saying that, the house piece flies out again. It goes way underneath this great big long outdoor bin of a different store. It goes far enough underneath that there are cobwebs. I’m not fantastically excited about chasing it under here but I do because the game is useless without that piece. I saw it go under there but it’s really dark. I feel around with my hand and there’s only one thing that’s not first so I grab it. It doesn’t look like the house piece anymore - it’s flat and not moving. I go back under there again to check around for anything else and there’s not. I put the piece in the box and am feeling like it’s not the piece. I’m already wondering where we’re going to get another one of those pieces. I know that we can’t. We continue on towards the house. There’s a guy I dated for a little while lingering around the outside. He’s trying to engage with my family. I’m like, “Oh, don’t talk to him. I don’t want him anywhere near us.” I don’t speak to him. He’s acting like I did. He’s smiling and being oblivious. He’s walking with my family. I’m getting really annoyed because he’s dense and acting like someone welcomed him in when nobody did. He follows us up the ramp and now he’s in the house. I’m ignoring him. He’s at my back. I set the board game down on the table. He puts his hands on my shoulders and says, “Here, if you put this on, it will take away all the pain from your neck, shoulders and back.” I look down and at first it looks like the thing a catcher wears in a baseball game. It’s made of this dark blue rough cotton stuff, like something a priestess would wear. It’s over my clothes. He’s pulling the drawstrings at the back tightly - they’re laces - the way someone would lace up the back of a corset. It’s very constricting and makes my arms stick out awkwardly by my side. I’m telling him, “Look, I don’t want this. Can you please just get out of the house? You don’t live here. This is not your place.” He lies down on the couch and goes to sleep. I’m poking at him and he won’t move. I don’t know how to deal with this. I’m looking for my daughter to ask her if she can take these laces off and get me out of this thing. I go upstairs and there’s been a whole pile of people up there with a whole bunch of kids. They’ve gotten into everything. They’ve pulled it all out. I get the vacuum out and start vacuuming things up. You know when there’s a whole bunch of stuff in the rug and you can hear it clicking as it goes up the vacuum tube? I’m thinking I’ll have to clean all this up with my hands. I start doing this. I realize there’s more furniture than will fit in the rooms and there’s stuff all over the floor. I’m trying to sort it out and figure out what goes in what room and what we really need. We need something to put towels in and there’s nothing in the bathroom and no cabinet. Where are we going to put all the towels? I go into my room. There’s stuff all over the floor! There’s this three year old kid and I don’t know who she belongs to. She’s dumped everything out onto the carpet. I pick it up and put it in bags. I think I’ve got as much as i can with my hands and start to run the vacuum. When I lift up the bedskirt to vacuum under the bed, the vacuum won’t go any further. I bend down and look. There are bags of oatmeal cereal that have been poured out and dumped. The oatmeal is eight inches thick. It’s all underneath the bed. My daughter comes in and knows I’m upset. She says, “What do you want me to do?” I tell her, “Can you please just keep picking this stuff up off the floor? Look, the vacuum isn’t even getting it all out.” Somebody has taken this black soil from a plant and it’s slightly wet so even when the vacuum goes over, it leaves a black stain everywhere. I’m overwhelmed with all the stuff that isn’t useful and is not in place and the people who aren’t listening to me and are in my house.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

On the third or fourth round,I was eliminated. I hadn't been on key and my timing was off, but I also had been attempting to harmonize and play using a more kazoo like style. I explained this to my mom but she didn't change her mind. I had made 3 points however and was told to pick 3 points worth of prizes from a nearby banker's box. We were all in the living room of our old house on UCF. I rummaged through the box but couldn't find anything good. All I could get for 3 points was sheet music to some songs I didn't like. One of them had the word ""Lird"" in it's title.   I was very annoyed at this point and complained to my mom. She ignored my complaints again and I left.   I was lying on my bed and could hear my mom playing a classical guitar piece from Estin. It was highly complicated and I didn't think that it would be easy to play on kazoo. I heard someone trying to play along on a guitar and thought it might be my mom. When I looked up, I saw that it was my dad sitting in a chair in the living room and playing a red acoustic guitar. He played well but had some work to do to get the song down. I went over and he began playing a beautiful piece that I didn't recognize. He then turned the guitar to an open D so that he could play the song more easily. He slid his hands up the guitar and played the new melody. It looked simple enough.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

1728,1259,,13/11/2020,11/13/2020 00:01,"I’m in my condo. It’s dark and it’s Friday night. I’ve just taken the kids to their dad’s. I’m looking forward to having time to myself and time with Josh. I hear a noise. I get up out of bed and go out into the living room, which is pitch black. My son and brother are on the couch but they’re both young, like six or seven. I’m like, “What are you guys doing here?” They’re like, “Dad just dropped us off.” I’m so confused because I just dropped them off at their dad’s house and I’m supposed to have all this time to myself and here they are and they’re sick. I’m trying to text my ex, “You’re supposed to have the kids right now. They’re sick. You left them here. I have plans for this weekend. It’s not my time with them.” My ex comes down from the stairs and starts telling me something. I’m like, “I don’t care what your story is and I don’t know why you’re in my house but you need to take the kids out.” I’m feeling super upset and start to feel that I have a sore throat in real life, as if whatever is happening in the dream is actually physically affecting me like I’m going to catch strep or something. This is something that did happen a lot when I was with my ex because he’s a strep carrier. In the dream, the kids are hot and sick and their voices are scratchy. I can tell they feel lonely because I’m trying to text their dad to come get the kids and then he shows up and argues with me about how I have to keep them. Then I start to get the sore throat in real life. Then the dream shifts. I’m with Josh at his house. He drinks coffee in the morning and I drink matcha. I’m trying to make my matcha and there are all these coffee mugs all over the counter and dirty dishes and water in the sink with soap and dishes in it and dishes in the strainer. I think I poured my matcha into a mug but it’s actually a glass and it’s hot so that’s not going to work because there’s no handle on the glass. I’m watching Josh drink his coffee. He’s drinking out of a cup with the Sun Tarot card on the front. I’m like, “Uh, I want a better mug for my matcha that has a Tarot card on it.” I look in the cupboard and see one with the Lovers on it. There’s a random Six of Swords, too. I take the Lovers, obviously. I go to switch mugs and stop and do the dishes. Josh is trying to tend to me but he’s a little distracted because his dad’s in the house and his sister is in the house. His sister has some friends there and his dad has some friends. There are people in the house who are supposedly friends of mine but I don’t recognize them. The house doesn’t look like Josh’s actual house. I go out into the dining room where everyone is. The dining room is dark and there’s a big long heavy wooden table that sits ten or twelve. The legs are thick and super sturdy and there are benches on either side. I see a bunch of younger kids hanging around. I’m feeling out of place because I’m not sure what I’m doing there and I don’t really know anyone else. I think they’re Josh’s friends from before when he lived in Ohio. He’s talking with them and I’m trying to pay attention and be part of it, but I still don't have my matcha the way I want it. I go back into the kitchen to try and get it in a cup. I go to pick it up and the cup is leaking so it’s spilling everywhere. Josh tries to help me and I get the sense that he’s irritated with me because he’s trying to caretake me but also missing out on interacting with his friends. The scene shifts. Instead of being in a house, now we’re on a soccer field. It’s outdoors but there are lectures happening and it’s a bunch of Waldorf teachers lecturing. What’s so weird about this is Josh and his friends, who are all thugs because they started doing drugs when they were twelve and drinking and smoking, and then there’s me sitting in this little camping chair. A lot of people are sitting in those kinds of chairs. There are also some of my friends who are younger and parents who are my age with children. There’s one Waldorf teacher who I hired to tutor my daughter when she was younger. She is writing on the chalkboard, making beautiful pictures all in one fluid motion. I realize her piece of chalk which is a fat square is patterned, so as she writes the pattern on the chalk comes out onto the chalkboard. That doesn’t exist in real life as far as I know, but in the dream it does and it’s totally rad. She finishes her lecture and writing. I’m mouthing at her: “Can I see the chalk?” She hands it over. At some point I’m holding a baby, it’s not mine. It’s a three month old infant. There are also cats and dogs around. I don’t know who the baby belongs to, but I’m going to take care of it and watch over it and whoever’s it is will come eventually. I put the baby down onto the chair and go somewhere. I go swimming and I’m in the water with a bunch of people. I think Josh is in the water with me. I think we grow tails and are like mermaids from Harry Potter because we’re under the water. That shifts and I’m back out of the water. I go to find the chair I was sitting in with the baby. I can’t find the chair but I find another chair covered in blankets. I take the blankets off. There’s a dog leash attached to this chair and there’s a tiny, tiny baby, maybe a couple days old. The baby is about as long as my forearm. I’m like, “Oh my gosh, whose baby is this?” I look up and turn around and the dad is right there. He’s like, “Oh that’s my baby, we’re watching it.” I’m like, “Oh okay, good, somebody is watching this baby.” The Waldorf presentation continues and now there’s a projector playing some sort of music out onto a screen. I don’t know where this screen came from. We’re all still out on this gigantic field. I don’t know if it’s a wall of a building or a screen suspended from the sky. Josh has been around this whole time but he’s not actually with me. It feels kind of strange because there’s a little bit of space and estrangement between us. The projector is between Josh and I. Josh and his friends are leaning on a counter watching the screen. One of the Waldorf teachers turns to me and is like, “Can you go back in the back room?” The room is off to my left and off to Josh’s right because we’re facing each other across the space. In this room are a bunch of other adults and a guy with a video camera in his hands. He’s filming. The Waldorf teacher is like, “Can you go over there and tell that guy to stop filming or at least move because he’s showing up in the film that the projector is putting out onto the screen.” I don’t know what is being projected - the images aren’t sticking in my memory. I go to move him but then I start showing up on the projector screen. The teachers are yelling at both of us. I don’t know how this is happening because the projector is over to our right and in front of us, he’s got a video camera in his hand and I’m behind him trying to tell him to scooch over a little bit. I don’t know how we’re ending up on the screen. I’m telling one of the Waldorf teachers, “I can’t help you. I don’t know what you want.” I’m telling them that they need to come and adjust whatever they want to adjust. I go back to where I was sitting. Josh comes over and is like, “I know you’re trying to stay out of the way but you’re really in the way.” I’m like, “Jesus, not winning here.”",Rose,last_nights_dream
1729,1479,,13/11/2020,11/13/2020 00:02,"“The Bus Trip” I’m on a tour bus, a coach bus that they charter for tours across the country. I’m with Natalie, one of the owners of the Yoga Studio where I work and two little girls, maybe about ages four and six, somewhere in there. The kids are a lot younger so I’m assuming that they're two of her four kids, but maybe not. The bus stops and we all get out. There’s a baseball game going on in a field. The baseball diamond is at the back of a building. I’m not sure what’s going on in the building. It’s almost like a school meet and greet, it has that kind of feel to it. Natalie and the two girls go off and join up with the meet and greet. I’m more interested in the baseball. Because I’m not a regular player, they put me in the outfield, which is fine. I’m standing there, the way you would in the outfield, waiting for something to happen out there. I start to listen to the dialogue between the other outfielders. I notice that they’re mocking a woman. The mockery is to do with women is like, “Yeah right, they’re not good for baseball that’s for sure.” Then the men all laugh. I suddenly think, “Are they talking about me?” I notice that there are about ten outfielders and one or two other women while the others are men. At first I’m offended by this. I feel a little bit of umbrage start to rise up because I’m actually really good at baseball. They don't know this. I notice that although they’re mocking, they’re also smiling as though they also appreciate the fact that the women have some skills. It’s a strange mix of regard and disregard. As I’m noticing this, I'm also noticing their clothing. It looks like the kind of clothing that men in the fifties would wear. I suddenly notice they all have fifties style clothing with the vest overtop of the short sleeved shirt. I realize as I look at the women's clothing and the umpire wearing this heavy leather vest instead of the sleek light-weight material it’s made of now that it is the fifties. This is how me in the fifties probably talked about women as co-ed games just began to rise in acceptability. I’m gladI restrained myself and didn’t say anything because I don’t want to stand out and show that I’m from a different time period. The baseball game ensues. I do catch a couple baseballs and throw them to the appropriate pitch. I get a couple of hands across the back, guy’s style way to go slaps. The baseball game ends. I see Natalie and the two girls walking across the field towards me and we get back on the bus. The next stop is a big long building that’s a flea market. The tour guide stands up and says, “Okay, you’ve got enough time for five cubbies or booths and two something elses.” So we get off the bus and we know we have to hurry because there are only a hundred and we can only pick five and then two. We have to make sure it’s the ones we want. I don’t really care about anything that’s there. I let Natalie do the selection and I think that will keep the girls occupied because they’re starting to get a little bit restless. One of the ones we go into is a freestyle jumping area with skipping ropes and things to climb through. They are made of a different material and there are no electronics. I’m wondering what time period this is from. One of the others is a playhouse. It’s so sexist. The girls are playing and they’re sweeping and pretending to wash dishes. I’m quickly losing interest in this and looking around to see what else I might be interested in. I go over to ask Natalie what time it is on her phone. We both have cell phones, but nobody else has this kind of equipment. The girls are already finished. We have a little extra time that we’re starting to bank. The next thing we see is a big long room with racks and racks of clothing. Interestingly, they’re sorted into colors and not sizes. I’m really liking this. Natalie says, “Let’s bring the girls through here because it’s so vast that just walking through will burn off some of their energy. I say, “Great because there’s some stuff I’d like to look at here.” I’m thinking that if I can look closely enough at the clothing, I can figure out what decade this is. But what happens is that the girls run through and we’re burning through it and we’ll be done ahead of time and I’m not getting time to look at the clothes. I tell her that I want to go back and look at two different colors of clothing, although there's actually three when I think about it. I say, “I’ll meet you back at the door when it’s time for us to get back on the bus.” She says, “Okay, that’s only five minutes from now.” I say, “That’s fine. I’ll work quickly.” I go back and I’m looking through the brown clothing. I think this is from the sixties. I’m picturing myself wearing this brown dress with the waist line just under the breasts and the full flowy skirt. I think I can do my eye makeup like the sixties and put my hair back like the sixties. I really want this dress. But there are only two sizes and one is obviously too small and there’s no way my boobs will fit in it, and the other one is giant. I’m disappointed because I really wanted one. I go over to the indigo rack. I don’t like anything I see there, it’s all ugly. There’s another rack of really light peach and a cashmere shirt with no sleeves and a little tiny soft loose turtleneck. I really want this shirt - it would be so soft and I could wear the peach color on my lips and still wear my hair and eye makeup in the sixties style. But there’s not enough time for me to buy it! I run back to the door and Natalie is standing there with the two kids. She’s saying, “The bus driver is looking for you!” I get on the bus and am disappointed and thinking about that shirt and then I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

As the helicopter lands, the wind picks up and my kayak oar is starting to get sucked toward the helicopter. I'm worried it will end up hitting one of the passengers so I jump on top of the oar pinning it to the ground. My fingers are still in my ears.

The truck is too close for comfort and after the men load the helicopter onto the trailer the truck turns in my direction. I roll quickly to avoid being hit by truck and I go underneath missing the truck's wheels by inches. The wheels of the trailer though do run over me but didn't hurt as the helicopter was surprisingly light.

1742,1480,,15/11/2020,11/15/2020 00:02,"“My New Boyfriend” I’m working in a hospital type environment. It’s very disorganized. I’m a contract employee. They keep not getting the files together for the job they’ve contracted me to do. When I come into work to do my job, they’re scrambling around to find me something else to do. It’s almost as though the supervisor is not doing her job and it’s her job to have the things ready for me to do my job. She doesn’t want anyone to find out that she’s disorganized and not doing it properly. So there’s a pretense of shuffling me around from department to department so there’s always something for me to do, but it’s a little different every day and definitely not what I’m supposed to be doing. This one particular day, it’s really vague what I’m supposed to be doing, but it’s something to do with documents. The documents are classified. They’re in sealed envelopes. I’ve been put on that job from my regular job because this time I have a shoulder injury. There’s a flashback in the dream to how I hurt my shoulder. The flashback is instigated by another peer, a colleague, asking me why I’m on that job today. There’s some inside jokes about the supervisor not having done her thing, like, “Oh, why are you doing this job this time?” They’re not making fun of me, they’re actually mocking her a little bit because she’s known to be disorganized. I tell them it’s because I was lifting weights in my room at home and I’ve been doing this for quite some time with success and building up the muscles in my arms. One day I guess I added on too much weight, but I’m surprised because I only added on one pound and I had been working with the previous weight for a couple of weeks. So I really don’t think my muscles would have given out like that, but they did. She says, “Oh where do you feel it?” I take my hand and run it from the top of my left shoulder down around the deltoid muscle. I say, “It starts here, runs down to there and then I can feel it at the front, right at the head of my upper arm bone. It starts there and runs underneath my collarbone and stops here.” She gives me a sympathetic look then carries on with what she’s doing. So there I am again, sitting on a stool going through these manila envelopes, but I run out. There’s supposed to be at least two boxes full and I don’t have enough to do whatever it is I’m supposed to do with them. I approach the supervisor and say, “There was supposed to be two boxes of these, but there’s barely half a box.” She doesn’t say anything. She just kind of looks at me and looks a bit guilty then says, “Alright, here. I’m going to put you on the timecards. They need to be sorted out, too.” So we go through the busy hallway to where people keep their timecards and punch in and punch out. It’s terrible. There are lunch bags in the slots and envelopes that were supposed to be in my box. There are two timecards in all of the 200 slot. The rest of the stuff is garbage or doesn’t belong there. She just walks away. I roll my eyes and can’t believe this. I start sorting it all out. I find a round thing that looks like a spool of thread but is not, it’s just plastic - it’s the kind of thing that comes in bottles of supplements to keep them from getting too moist. There are things like that in slots. It’s just a disaster. While I’m sorting these out, this man comes into the room. He’s tall and looks healthy, his shoulders are broad, he’s got sandy blond hair. He’s wearing a shirt and tie and suit pants, but no suit jacket. He looks at me and says, “Oh I haven’t seen you here before.” I tell him this isn’t my regular job. He asks me what my regular job is. I can’t tell him because someone comes up at that moment looking for their timecard. I say, “Alright, it should be here. You’re right. You are on the payroll. Don’t worry. Let me go find the supervisor, so I can manually clock you out. We need to make a list of whose timecards are missing.” I go to look for the supervisor and she’s not at her desk. I’m trying to find a clipboard and some paper so I can start a list. The man comes back over and he sits in the chair in front of her desk where people would sit to speak with her. I can feel there’s some kind of magnetism between him and I as he sits down. He’s looking at me intently. There really isn’t any conversation, it’s more like body heat frequency. But we do have a conversation, I just don’t remember what it was in my dream. I return back to sort out this mess in the staff room with the timecards. I’m doing this. The time passes so it’s the end of the shift. And there he is again, but he’s looking for his timecard to clock out. I go to write his name on the clipboard but he takes it out of my hand and sets it on the counter and says, “You don’t need to do that.” I wonder who he is because he’s dressed as though he’s from upper management and I’m starting to think he’s there as my supervisor’s boss or he’s been sent there to check on her department. He’s going everywhere. I see that he’s been everywhere. He says, “This isn’t your normal job.” I say, “No.” He says, “You have an incredibly diverse training. It’s lucky that you’re able to fill in around here as you do.” I feel like he’s read my file. I agree and tell him I do have all that training. I just say, “Yes.” But now it’s time to go. My shift is over. I set the clipboard down and do a few more things to the timecards. Now that the garbage is all gone, all you can see are the two timecards, but it looks much better. I leave the staff room to go down the hallway. There’s a washroom before the exit door and I do need to use the washroom. And there he is again, standing right there beside me. The side of his hip is right next to me and I can feel the warmth of his body so close to the side of my leg. I tell him, “I’m getting a little bit flustered now. I’ll be right back. I’m going into the washroom.” I do and now I feel comfortable, my bladder is not full. When I come out he asks me if I’m going out that door as he indicates the one in front of me. I tell him I am and he says he’s going that way, too. Now I can feel the side of his leg pressing up against mine. Everybody is leaving work. The hallway is crowded, but I know it’s not actually an accident. We approach the door, open it and we’re standing outside. Then I see that instead of the stairs that are normally there, it’s just a sheer wall with three stories up and against the wall is this eight-inch thick blue gym mat, the kind they put at the base of a balance beam for gymnastics. It has been wired against the wall. There are these two centimeter thick metal mesh, horizontal across it and all the way down at about six inch intervals, and vertical ones going from top to bottom, so they create rectangles. The vertical ones are about four inches apart. Now he has his arm around my waist. I can feel his hand, it’s so solid, strong and sturdy. He says, “I guess this is how we have to get down.” I’m terrified. He says, “Let’s just take one step at a time.” So I do the unthinkable. I turn around so that the front of my body is facing this. I can feel the wires under my toes. I move down one set then move my hands down one set. There are probably a thousand of these that I’ll need to take all the way to the bottom. He’s right beside me. We’ve gone about six feet, about the height of our own bodies, when I feel the whole gym mat pull away from the side of the building. I’m like, “Oh my god, I thought this was attached.” I realize that the wire mesh is the top surface of the gym mat but it’s not actually attached to anything, so if you lean back just a little bit, the whole thing will come away from the building. Now I’m even more scared than I was before. He’s gotten a little bit ahead of me. I wonder if it would have been better to stay completely in sync. Then I hear him make a couple of alarmed gasps. He’s lost some of his grip. I’m like, “No!” I turn around and he’s falling. He falls all the way down to the bottom. I feel like my heart’s broken, like I’ve lost my soulmate. I think he’s dead because of the height of the fall. Then two other people run over to see if he’s okay. I don’t know if he’s okay. I turn around and I face the wall and I take another few steps, first the feet then the hands, the feet then the hands. It’s windy, the kind of windy where you’re up too high. The wind is trying to push me away from the wall. I’m afraid that the blue mat is going to come away and carry me with it. I go about another body height and realize there’s a seam in the gym mat, at one time it must have folded up - the top half to the middle and the bottom half to the middle. Now the seam is making it unstable and that’s why he fell. I can feel the top half without the weight of my body keeping it close to the wall is now coming away from the wall. I can feel the whole thing move as a unit. I feel like I’m falling back and then it buckles and I fall all the way down to the bottom. But, I didn’t let go of the top part, I’m still clinging onto it with my fingers. I actually fall onto the back of it as the whole thing falls down. I’m okay, it cushioned my fall. The man comes over and says, “Of course you navigated that well.” He’s fine. He picks me up and we embrace. I can feel him hugging me and his strength. I’m just so happy that he’s okay and I’m okay and that we can continue to explore this incredible magnetism that we have between us.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I am selecting my weapons but don't have much time and end up with a decent SMG and the default pistol. I am on a team but I can't easily tell who is who. I try to shoot someone but nothing happens. The round hasn't started yet. I round a corner and find most of the rest of my team preparing for the enemy to try to break through our defenses. Quite a few people are in formation forming roughly a 10 man by 10 man  unit. I move past and duck behind a wall.  The round begins and it is clear that we are outnumbered. The enemy rushes up and while our strategy is good, we were losing too many men. I jump up and take down a few enemies each requiring several shots from my SMG. They break through and a few rush to our base to claim victory. I follow and take out a few more with my pistol until it too runs out of ammo. There is one man going into our base. I see a shotgun lying on the ground and I pick it up and try to shoot the man. It doesn't work and instead I pull out a dark glass beer bottle and repeatedly hit him over the head with it. It should have knocked him out but had no effect. He only seemed amused. The round was over and we had lost.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

1745,1481,,16/11/2020,11/16/2020 00:01,"“Maps” I’m driving around Toronto and I have to be somewhere at a certain time so that my son can attend the school. I have someone in the seat beside me, I think it might be my cycling friend. He’s fiddling with my radio and I’ve asked him not to because it’s connected to some kind of complex GPS in the middle of my steering wheel. If the radio stays on one station, then I’ve got wireless for my GPS. I've never been to this school before so I need to use the GPS, but normally I don’t use it to drive around Toronto because I know my way. So my son is in the backseat with his friend and they’re both going to this school, I think. My friend keeps fiddling with the radio and I keep saying, “Will you please stop doing that? I need it because I’m going to have to turn the GPS on in a moment.” It’s time to leave and drive my son to school. But he continues to fiddle with it and I’m getting a little annoyed with him. He says, “Don’t worry, you’ll be able to find the statio afterwards.” I press the buttons on the steering wheel because we’re now all in the car. Of course it’s dark and I can’t see very well. The traffic is crazy in Toronto. People get annoyed if you’re not driving quickly enough and the lanes are too narrow and there are too many cars. I put the coordinates in and see the lights flicker. The map comes to life and pinpoints where we are and where the school is. It’s on satellite view and I want to zoom in so I can see the street names so I have advanced warning for when I have to turn right or left because the traffic is so crazy here. That’s why I need the radio station to be on a certain channel. With my right hand, I'm turning it back to the channel I had it on and of course it’s static. I look over at my friend and say, “You did mess it up. I need you to fix it and I need you to do it right away because I have to turn soon and I don’t know what street to turn on.” He fiddles around with it and puts it back on the station it’s supposed to be. I zoom in on the map on my steering wheel and see the names of the streets. Now I’m just driving there. The map has told me to go further. I’m at a traffic light and see ahead of me the highway which will take me out of town. Luckily there’s no one behind me or beside me because I have to pull a U-turn. I see the school and it’s not what the map said to do, but there it is. So I pull a U-turn, pull my car over where I’m not supposed to park and where nobody’s supposed to be. I tell the boys to get out, “Quickly just go run into your class!” It's portable and camouflaged so you can’t even tell it’s there. They get out. I say, “I’ll go park the car and I’ll be back in with your school bag. I’ll find you, don’t worry. Just get to your class on time.” They do. I find someplace to park the car. There’s a great big bin with hundreds of school bags in it. I don’t know which one is my son’s. I walk across the street, go up a couple of blocks, go to the portable and tell the teacher, “Sorry, I don’t mean to bother you, but we had trouble getting here and I need to give my son his school bag.” She says, “Okay, that's fine.” He’s writing a test. I sneak quietly between the rows of desks and they’re packed in really tight. I whisper to my son, “What is it that you need?” He tells me what it is - a pile of white papers. I wonder how I’m supposed to find it with that description. I turn around, go back out and go up the two blocks. I open the backseat of my car. I’m not sure if what I’m getting is correct. I gather it up and it’s not papers at all, they’re clips. They’re like the wire clips you put inside curtains to gather pieces together and hook them to a curtain rod - like you put eight or ten together on a long piece of fabric that has the holes in already. There are three prongs on the end of each curtain hook and you have to insert the curtain fabric up inside the prongs and it makes the curtain look like there are pleats in it. So there are twelve of these. I can barely hold them together in my hands. When I pick them up, one falls down and rolls underneath all the long lines of cars. I hear it stop and know it’s under a car, but it’s dark and I can’t see it. I spend some time looking for it, crawling under the cars in the mud. I still can’t find it. I need to get back and I’m not going to arrive in time, he’ll be finished. So I’m carrying these down the block and back to the school. As I’m doing this, the other kid who is his friend passes by me. He says my son needs me to get something, a pink binder. He’s very specific as he’s describing it. I think, “Oh,that’s what he needs!” I go in anyway and tell the teacher that we have these clips that we thought we were supposed to prepare and my son has gathered them. I set them down. She’s sitting at a picnic table outside the portable, waiting for the kids to finish. As I’m setting them down, another one rolls in the grass and I hear it land. She saw it too. She looks around a little bit, too. I’m realizing that I did go back to the car and looked inside the bin and found the pink binder that the friend described. I took it back and gave it to my son. Now I’m sitting at the picnic table with the teacher. She says, “I need to talk to you about your son. He’s been getting really good marks but I’m not sure if he’s earned them.” I tell her that we just need to get him through high school and I realize some of the marks haven’t been earned but he tests brilliantly in his mind but he has a gap between getting the things from his mind onto a piece of paper. He’s entirely the kind of kid who needs to go to university where his mind is stimulated by something he wants to do. I say, “He tests as though he can be a counselor or psychiatrist or something along that line where he’s working with people. He needs to finish high school to get there, so that’s why I haven’t said anything about some of the marks.” She says, “Yeah, it’s the teachers that are giving him higher marks than he should be getting.” I shrug my shoulders because I’m not going to dispute that and I'm also not going to take it to task.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

We’re all going in and out of the kitchen putting together a bunch of different salads and setting the table. They’re mostly young adults in their twenties, just out of college it seems. I get a phone call from a landline. It’s Ted. I can hardly hear him because of all the activity in the kitchen and people with their pots and pans and multiple conversations. I can hear the gist of it. He’s having a hard time. I suggest he come in for some care. He makes a comment that is the closest thing to being overt about his attraction to me that I’ve ever heard. He’s saying, “Will it be okay for you to treat someone who’s hitting on you?” I'm thinking about all the rules and regulations and if this would be okay because I would like to see him. The conversations in the kitchen get louder and someone asks me to set the table so I have to go. There’s a shift in the dream. There’s a young couple in a courtyard. Tables are set up for an event. The couple is wandering through. They’ve met each other here and are wanting to extend the night. They’re walking around and I’m watching them. They’re falling in love as the day and evening go by. Their families arrive and for some reason they’re not supposed to be together. The families overlook it for now. The dream goes by and they’re spending more time together. He’s painting her and writing about her. His family forbids them from seeing each other. But she’s moved in with him. She’s packing to go and she shows him where she has stored papers and journals beside his bed. She says, “If you miss me and want to know me better, look through these papers.” There are empty plastic organizing folders and receipt folders filled with receipts from 2007 or 2017. She points out the years and says, “If you want to know who I was back then, you can look at these.” She’s being transparent about her past. She has to leave and she does. They make an arrangement to meet at a sporting goods store in the future. She walks in and there are people taking a physical therapy exercise class at the back of the store and there are different exercise stations throughout the store. People are trying out the equipment and taking class. She wanders to the back and meets people and thinks she could help them more at her office. But she realizes they only have to pay $5 a class here and they are getting some help here. She sees him and they have to pretend they haven’t. She wanders to the front of the store where there are two television screens set up showing an exercise dance class. It’s an interesting setup because one television shows the front of the teacher and the other shows the back of the teacher, so it’s easier to follow along. He sees her dancing and walks over to sit near her and set up his art exhibit. Then his mom comes in and she’s dressed primly. She’s paging through the book the couple had made together - the woman has written the words and he’s drawn the pictures. A lot of the pictures are of the young woman. The mom is flipping through the book. There are pictures of the mom, too. She’s pretending to not be impressed but it is truly a fabulous piece of art.

Musicians are setting up. I see a guy with dreads who I think might be DJ Drez and some others. I could stay but I keep walking to check out the whole venue. Each room has a different feel, some with couches for lounging, some set up for lunch or dinner, some more open for music and dancing. I turn around to go back and now it’s really crowded.

It’s also still COVID, so it’s uncomfortable for me to be so close to so many people all crowded together. I do make it through by pushing the tables away from the wall just enough to squeeze by. I make it back to the more open room for music and dancing. People are more distanced here and tables are set up around the perimeter. I am uncomfortable because I have to sit at a table that’s already occupied by people who are in the stoned yoga art community. They kind of welcome me but I feel out of place. I get up and walk to the back of the room where a buffet brunch is set up. There is an empty chair that I’d like to sit on, but they’ve roped it off and set a warming plate on it for omelettes and pancakes. There are guys in chef hats and aprons making omelettes behind plastic shields hanging from the ceiling. The buffet table has a large selection of breakfast and lunch choices that have been partially eaten. People have cut into the quiches and bread puddings, so it’s been open for a while. I wonder if there would be enough time for me to fully enjoy the brunch if I bought it now. Maybe it would because I could hang out all day listening to music and eating. I walk through and see a group of people setting up for a comedy show. It’s a comedy show about pilgrims and indians. They’re making a pancake breakfast and throwing whipped cream at each other’s faces, so it’s like a clown show meets Thanksgiving.

I leave him to it and wander off out of this party. There’s somewhere I need to go, but I don’t know where and I don’t recognize where I am. I end up in the parking lot of an outdoor shopping area. Josh has this huge SUV, ridiculous in size, where it takes up the entire lane and two parking spots. He drives up and says, “Okay, I guess we’re leaving. Let’s go.” I hop in the car and he starts to drive. I’m not comfortable with the way he’s driving. He’s driving on the road then decides to go off-road and goes over curbs and at one point he drives through a park with green grass and tall trees. All I can see are the trunks of the trees - I can’t see their leaves or branches. He’s weaving through the trees. I’m like, “Why are we not on the road?” He’s like, “We’re just having fun.” I say, “Okay, but I’m not comfortable and I don’t like that we’re not on the road.” Eventually he gets back on the road.

It was a very beautiful property, but in the dream, it’s multicolored, painted different colors on different panels, it’s very clownish. We continue to drive. On the right hand side is another park. There’s a construction trailer on site and it’s painted in the same way as the building. In the dream I recognize it as my mom’s old work trailer where she used to do work out of, but in this reality she never had a trailer like this. We pass it. The grass is green and there’s a center area of the park with water fountains and benches and an area with rings and ropes like a jungle gym for adults. We pull over. Josh stops and says, “Let’s work out here.” I say okay but I’m going to do my own workout and he’s going to do his hardcore Crossfit workout. While we’re there, two Crossfit gyms show up to do their workouts, one after the other. The first gym is there and I’m watching them. They’re all going across these ropes and rings. I’m noticing how everybody has good upper body strength. The first gym is pretty elite athletes and they’re all super ripped and their shoulder muscles are super big. Josh is in with them and practicing along with them. I’m just watching. I’m putting on knee pads that I have to tie and they have really long laces. I’m tying these laces around my knee multiple times. I’m watching this first group and then they clear up and I think it’s time for me to go do my workout. But then the second group shows up before I finish tying these weird knee pads. They’re not as strong in the way they’re getting across the rings and ropes; they’re kind of modifying. There are rails underneath that they’re using. They’re doing a relay and some of them are screwing up and missing the rings. Somewhere in this my mom is lurking in the background. I feel like she’s wanting to tell me something. I’m feeling frustrated because I can’t get on these rings and I can’t practice. I also feel that I’m not strong enough to do it and that's really frustrating. I don’t ever actually get on the rings. The whole time Josh is in and out of the dream space, but I don’t feel connected to him and he’s not behaving like himself and he doesn’t fully look like himself. It’s like he’s him but not quite.

1758,1482,,19/11/2020,11/19/2020 00:03,"“Cottage in Mexico” This dream begins in the car. I’m driving with my younger brother. We’ve driven a long way and that part isn’t in the dream. I didn’t know where we were going, but it didn’t matter, it was a family road trip. I’m always only there just for the family time. I do get the sense there is wide open blue sky and red dirt. We come to a place where we stop. My brother lets me know that now we are going somewhere else, we’re not just driving around, we have a destination. We drive through a really dilapidated town. The sky has a certain color because it is reflecting a large body of water. It looks like water is not that far away. My brother drives the car through an area with houses. He says, “We bought a cottage.” I’m looking at a ten by ten shack. The bottom part doesn’t even have wood. I’m thinking, “Really, you bought that?” He says, “No. Turn around behind you.” I see a much larger building. It’s also not in very good condition, but it’s livable. There’s a great big backyard. We pull the car then my parents pull up - they’ve been driving towards the same destination - and then my other brother pulls up in his car. So we have three cars. My other brother has the trailer attached to his. We go in the house. We start opening windows, turning lights on, bringing some things from the cars - suitcases and stuff, but no furniture. The cottage is already furnished. There are three floors. The upstairs is a sleeping floor. The main floor is the kitchen and a living area. The bottom floor is one big long room with twenty tables with chairs around them. I realize as I’ve gone through all the floors that it has been set up as a retreat area. I ask my sister-in-law, “Are you guys going to start having retreats?” She says, “No, we’re going to set it up as a single family dwelling.” Then we start sweeping. We’re sweeping out the main floor first and getting the kitchen ready. My stepmom is doing some dishes because there’s dust on everything. We’re taking stock of what’s there. There’s enough that they don’t need to bring any of their own stuff. At this point, my young nephew, he’s only one, starts to get tired. My sister-in-law says we should go upstairs and sort out the sleeping arrangements. I follow her up. The bedrooms upstairs are small. We’re counting them and trying to see who’s going to sleep where. When we’re in one of the bedrooms, I look out the top window to see an amazing view of the ocean. I’m standing there looking at it for a little bit. My nephew crawls over and I can feel him tugging on my leg and he’s standing. I pick him up and we’re both looking out the window at the water. My sister-in-law comes over and says she has a bath ready for him. She takes him. I find some sheets.i’m starting to put them on all the beds. I finish that. I can still hear my nephew and sister-in-law in the bathroom. I go downstairs and my brother is in the kitchen. I ask him, “Are you guys moving here? This is a long way to go.” He says, “Well, I’ve been working from home for a while, so I’m thinking we can stay down here for up to six months and then we’ll go back home.” I think that’s a good arrangement. He says, “Yeah, except I’m broke now.” I wonder why he bought this. I ask him, “Well, did you buy this so you can flip it?” He‘s really handy. He says, “No, we’re going to keep it. My contract is almost due anyway.” I’m thinking this doesn’t really add up. I say, “Well, I'm really going to miss you living down here. Although I've been waiting myself to be able to get a cottage in Ireland or Scotland area, I just love it over there. I can just get something small. But it’s hard to do those things by yourself, especially if it needs work.” He says, “Yeah, I get that.” Then I go down to the main floor. My sister-in-law is there by herself so I’m assuming she’s put my nephew to bed. She opens up one of the cupboards and pulls something out. It looks like a long braid of sweetgrass. It’s long enough that she’s holding it in both of her hands. It looks like it’s been wrapped in parchment paper and it’s really dry, you can see little bits of it have crumbled off. I ask her what she’s going to do with it. She says, “Well, I think I’ll just burn it and see what it smells like.” I’m looking through other drawers for a lighter. I turn around and she’s found something to light it with. The smell is drifting over to me and I say to her, “That’s not sweet grass. That smells like marijauna.” She says, “Oh!” But she continues to smell it. Then I see that my nephew is not in bed, he’s playing on the floor in the other room. I tell her we need to take this upstairs and open all the windows so the smell doesn’t affect him. She says, “Yes.” She starts following me but she’s having to walk really slowly because the paper is really flimsy and the stuff is so dry that if you walk fast, it will fly out and get all over the floor which is also dangerous. She’s walking so slowly that the smoke is filling up the room. I’m looking around. Now I notice that the kitchen doesn’t have any windows. We are on the stairs now and I’m standing behind her to hide her from the others. We get to the next floor and into the closest bedroom. We open the bedroom door and then I say to her, “Well what are we going to do with it now? There’s nowhere to set it. Maybe we should just put it out in water.” She’s trying to use the parchment paper to pinch the burning parts and put the fire out. She says, “I think I want to save this.” I laugh and say, “I know for those times when somebody else is sleeping.” We both laugh and I say, “Yeah, there’s too much of this to throw out.” Then we both start pinching it to try and put it out. We finish doing that then we wrap it up like a tube and twist the ends - it’s like a giant long skinny candy. I hear some voices downstairs. We just leave it. We close the bedroom door and go back downstairs to the kitchen. There are two Mexican men and one of them has some paper money in his hand. He’s talking to my brother. They’re asking if they can buy the furniture that’s in the recreation room downstairs. He’s agreeing to do it. The guy is telling him that he’s offering him 50 Canadian dollars for each setting. I’m close enough to see that it’s not dollars but pesos, but he’s said it in Spanish and he said “dolares.” So when my brother goes down to start counting all the chairs and tables to do the math I run after him to try and talk to him without the other guys hearing me. I say, “Those aren’t dollars, they’re pesos. So he’s giving you fifty pesos which is way way way less than the dolares.” My brother is listening to me and we do a calculation and he goes back to haggle with them. I’m trusting that he now knows the information and will make a fair deal. Now we’re going around the tables and my stepmother is in the room, too. It’s dark. We haven’t figured out where the lights are. The tables are all identical, but the chairs are all different. There are more chairs than tables. I see that there are two press-backed rocking chairs randomly placed at the tables. These rocking chairs are exceedingly more valuable than the other ones. I’m trying to pull those out. There’s another chair that is quite intricate and I’ve put the three of them against the wall. I’ve set the other identical chairs around the table so they get sold. My stepmom sees what I’m doing and she’s also organizing the chairs so that the ones that get sold are the ones of lesser value and also fit with the tables. The men take them out to their truck and disappear. It’s like a ballroom now. It has a completely different feel with those business tables and chairs gone and just those two rocking chairs and the intricate chair. My stepmom and I place them together in the middle of the room. I’m thinking it would be nice to have a fireplace here. We leave the basement and go back up. My brother is in the kitchen. I’m saying, “Wow, I don’t know if I’ll ever see you guys again.” He says, “Well, return tickets are $893. That’s not bad. You can visit and stay as long as you want. All you have to pay for is your flight.” I’m thinking, “Yeah, but I’d need to bring both of my kids, too, and $893 times three is like $2,900 or something.” I feel really sad because I don’t think I can afford to go down and see him when he’s there.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

More people were showing up and the event became a funeral. Doug's family became the Davidson's family and it was their family that had suffered a death. There were a lot of children and they were in the living room making arts and crafts. I went in and played with the them the best I could. The children had made strange objects composed of many translucent and colored balls the size of oranges. One was given to me and I could see that it had as its center the face of a frog. I held it up to my own face and made ribbit noises.  Several of the children came over to me and rested against me or sat in my lap. I was a little worried abou this, but everything went well.  One of the children was a blonde haired girl who I though was one of the Davidson's girls. She was the one who had been born to a different father who she lived with. I think he was black. She was 17 years old and older than Sharon but she had initially looked much younger, only a small child. I felt guilty about asking her about her dad and she got up and left.  The funeral began and I went outside to meet others. I spoke with a few people and took my seat on the ground. It had been a hot day and I had been swimming with the children and didn't have a shirt on. I looked around and noticed that everyone else did. I felt very awkward as the funeral procession began and I wondered if I should go retrieve my shirt from my bag. Even then though I wouldn't be dressed appropriately.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

1763,1483,,20/11/2020,11/20/2020 00:02,"“The Creek” I’m in a forest and it’s winter. There are various people out in the forest as opposed to being in the squat stone building that maybe people live in. it has the atmosphere of danger and some kind of threat. I feel like people have been fighting recently. There’s a woman and she has sleepy eyes and a drink in her hand. I think she’s drunk. She’s wearing a long cloak and has some small beads that she’s wearing on her forehead. She’s older. There are bodies lying around, too, I can see them. They’re knights and their armor has been smashed and dented. I’m also wearing a long gown covered with a cloak. I don’t feel cold, but I know I would be if I weren’t wearing so many clothes. I’m waiting for people and we’re supposed to be leaving to go somewhere. I see one of the people I’ve been waiting for, a younger woman and she’s garbed the same way we are. I can see through the evening a low stone building. It looks like there is a big stone wall around the building. It’s like a low big building with a defense wall around it. We’re waiting for one more person before we take off. We have to go across the creek and through the other side because it will be safer that way. The creek is frozen over. As I’m standing there, I’m watching an animal go across. I can’t quite see what kind of animal because it’s dark and I’m trying to figure out what they are. On the other side, I see a bigger roundish black animal and a very small one that’s maybe the size of a dog or a cat. As my eyes start to focus in on them and get used to the dark, I realize the small one is a baby bear. The woman beside me says out loud or telepathically that she has to go get that bear because it’s her spirit animal. So she starts to slide down the bank, taking small steps and sliding on her bum a bit. Everyone is quite respectful and nervous of the creek because we don’t know if we can break through or not. But she wants to get the baby bear because it’s part of the journey. The other animal is not the mama bear; I think it’s a teenage bear. The baby is struggling. Its legs are too short to navigate the land. The younger woman starts across the creek. She asks, “Where did it go? I don’t see where it went.” I’m scanning the area with my eyes. I see another body, also female, at the side of the bank. She looks dead. The little bear has stumbled across towards her over the snow banks and frozen water that was heaved up over to the side. It looks like it’s trying to rouse her, licking her face and pawing at her. She doesn’t stir and I really think she’s dead. As the other woman stands up and walks across the creek, she’s about half way across and I see close to the shore I’m standing on, a hand reaching up from the ice. The hand has long thin fingers and reminds me of a sloth’s hands. I know it’s not human. It looks familiar but I don't quite know what it is. The baby bear stops trying to rouse the dead woman and has begun making its way towards the younger woman that was going to get it. It’s moving the way a puppy wags its whole body in happiness about being picked up or given attention. She does get the bear and pick it up. Now we have everything. There’s a woman behind me - the woman that looks drunk -, me and the one that has the small bear. We start to make our way across the creek. Then the dream blips out. We’ve made it across and there is less snow so the walking is easier. We’re going away from the small castle with the defense wall around it. We’re moving through the forest.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

The daughter was almost 18 and about to move out of the house. The son was much younger, maybe 5 or 6. I lived at my parents house but I might have owned it by now. A woman was angry with me and she had a semi truck. I got in my large work truck, the kind that looks like an ice cream truck and pulled out. The semi pushed me down the hill and across the street where I swung the wheel and skidded off to the side. The semi was unable to turn as quickly. I floored it and made it back up the hill hoping my engine would be more powerful. I gained some distance and hid behind a neighbor's house. I saw the blue semi go by on the street. My neighbor was out in his yard making a fire in a fire pit. J didn't want him to see that I had driven onto his yard. I got out and approached him.

1768,1484,,21/11/2020,11/21/2020 00:03,"“The Studio” I’m at the studio where I teach. It’s set up differently, though. The front of the building extends way out into the street and instead of just having a glass front, three of the sides are glass so it’s a lot more transparent and visible to people walking by. Before it always felt like a sanctuary with natural brick walls and the glass front and wood floors. In this dream it doesn’t feel that way. I’m standing at the front desk which is a lot bigger. One of the owners is there. The back hallway that normally leads into the studio is now a back entrance, so people are coming in the back entrance as well. There’s more than one studio now with two doors. I see my ex-husband and a bunch of his high school friends. They’re walking like a clump of high school age guys, pushing each other playfully and stuff like that. They walk in without checking in at the desk because they’re all self-absorbed. They just go down the hall into the studio. The owner is trying to piece together their names and check off their memberships for them. I’m thinking, “Oh great, they’re going to be in my class that I’m about to teach in a half hour.” I’m mentally rearranging my sequence so I can make it more physical because guys that age need that in order to focus and be present. So I’m just standing there in my head for a few minutes. Then a bunch of people come in through the back behind me. They’re also really loud. I don’t get to finish processing how I’m going to change my class in my head. They’re asking questions about the kids class. I’m like, “Kids class? We don’t have kids yoga.” My answer surprised them a little. They're talking amongst themselves. I look at the time and see that it’s time for me to teach my class. I go across to the hall and am starting my music. I go into the door and instead of a whole bunch of people lying on their mats, there’s a teacher from the jujitsu studio standing at the front and a whole bunch of eight year olds. I notice the room is really hot not because it’s a hot class but because there’s been so much body heat in there working really hard. It hits me like a wall when I open the door. I go back to the desk and say to the owner: “Do we have kids yoga?” She doesn’t reply. She’s already engaging with the group that had come in from the back and discussing the kids yoga with them. I’m like, “Oh, hmm, I guess they do.” Then I wait for her to finish her conversation with them. I say, “I don't know where my class is. The room is full of other people and kids.” She says, “Oh they’re supposed to have finished five minutes ago.” I go back to the door and this time they see me because I’m standing with the door open. The teacher says, “We’ll just be five more minutes.” I open the door fully and turn to look at the back of the room. I see my whole class practically sitting on top of each other. They don’t have their mats rolled out. My ex-husband is there with his gang. They’re all wrestling, piled on top of each other. Now it’s fifteen minutes past the time I was supposed to teach. I go back out to the desk. I tell the studio owner that it’s disrespectful to not follow the guidelines when you’re supposed to start and stop a class. She sighs, kind of dejectedly. Then we start talking about an energy exchange. She says, “We both need it. I can give you a hot stone massage and I’m really in need of a thai massage.” I say, “Yeah, that sounds like a really good idea.” We don’t deal with the problem of the room stuffed with people. The dream skips over and we’re trying to set up one of the rooms in the back hallway for the energy exchange. But as soon as we get into the room, the group of kids yoga is exiting and they’re all over the place. I realize I have to go into teach and say, “Oh I’m sorry, I can’t actually do the energy exchange, I have to go teach.” I go into teach. The group changed all the playlist around so I’m trying to figure out where mine is because now it’s playing hard rock. I do that. I put the quiet song on. I do manage to get everyone onto their mats and I start to teach my class. The dream blips. I don’t remember teaching the entirety of my class. When I come back out to the desk, the studio owner tells me she can’t do the energy exchange because she has a baseball game to go to now. She says, “I don’t want to ask you to come all the way in on a Saturday for this.” I’m thinking that she’s being kind of passive aggressive about this because her tone of voice and body language imply that she does want me to come in on a Saturday for this. I think I don't. I say, “Well is there any other Monday that you would be available? I could come in a little earlier before I teach.” She says, “No, I have baseball on all of them.” I’m thinking that she obviously knew that when we talked about an energy exchange so she really did mean to exchange on a Saturday. I decline the Saturday and leave the building. I start trudging through the stone and guess I’m going home. I get part way there and I see my ex-sister-in-law’s two dogs. I forget their names, they’re a specialty breed and look kind of like poodles or labradoodles, medium sized-dogs. I see them in the snow. One is more of a carmel color and the other is more white. The carmel color one is having trouble walking through the snow. It’s stopping and the snow plow hasn’t come by yet. They think they’re in a snow bank but they’re actually in the middle of the road. I pick up the carmel colored one and the white one is still running through. I forget their names so I’m just calling it, “Come on! Come on you can do this!” I’m trying to encourage it to go back over to the sidewalk. I’m going to walk the dogs home. The one I’m carrying is kind of heavy and my feet and legs feel heavy because of the snow. I look behind me for one second and then I don’t see the white one anymore. I look back the way I came and it’s lying down in the middle of the road. At first I think it’s dead. I touch it and it responds and it’s still warm, so it’s not dead. Now I’ve got both of the dogs in my arms and am trying to hold them under my arms like two footballs. They’re obviously sick and not well. I’m worried that their life is beginning to blink out. I’m struggling with them as I go down the sidewalk into the Co-op. It’s funny because she never lived there, but her twin sister did. I get stuck. There’s a community yard sale going on. I notice where the office used to be is a sign that now says, “Seneca College.” It’s now an office where they are trying to recruit teenagers from the Co-op directly into the college. I think that’s a pretty good idea. I’m trying to walk up the sidewalk towards her unit. There’s another dog and it’s a whippet - a racing dog with a long pointy nose. It’s snarling and growling aggressively as if it’s going to attack the other two dogs. I’ve got them in my arms and they’re not responding. They’re barely breathing. I tell this group of teenagers: “Can you please go ahead of me so there are people between that dog and these because it’s going to attack. They oblige. They do and are really nice about it. But we’re moving really slowly. I finally get to her door and knock on it and say, “Look who I found.” She’s so grateful and I say, “Oh, you live beside where I live!” Now it’s twenty years ago and I’m apparently living in the same unit I lived in when my daughter was little. She gets the dogs back and puts them in a specialty bed she made for them. She’s a nurse and is looking after them and everything seems to be fine.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

There are a bunch of cars that are our cars, too. If you go inside the house, it’s dark and dingy. A tv is playing and the furniture is gross. But we’re outside mostly on a picnic table. We’re planting plants into pots, at least I think that’s what we’re there to do. We’re there to make wreaths and plant plants. One of the sisters, Beth, comes and she’s like, “Okay, we’re going to do this but first we have to do our makeup.” It turns into a makeover situation and she has eyeliner and eyeshadow and I think eyelashes. She keeps handing them to Aila, who is in council with us. Aila is the one putting eyeliner on me and it’s a forest green color. Beth keeps saying, “Trust me, you’re going to look gorgeous.” And Aila is like, “Yup, I’ve got this.” She’s putting it on but I can’t see and there’s no mirror so I’m just trusting them. Aila goes to put on the fake eyelashes and she puts one on right over the bridge of my nose like a joke. I’m like, “I don’t think it’s supposed to be there.” Everyone is kind of laughing. There are other ladies who are part of the group but not necessarily part of council and they have this bright shimmery turquoise blue eyeshadow on because they were getting their makeup done, too. Somebody says they’re hungry. I go to make a phone call to order pizza. I’ve ordered pizza before at other gatherings so that’s why I volunteer. The pizza guy comes and he’s like, “I don’t know if you know this but because you’re new, you get ten free pizzas. So this is your second pizza and you can order eight more pizzas.” I’m surprised because I don’t eat pizza and I'm also surprised that a pizza place would give away pizza for free and that they would drive it out to us. I thank him and take the pizza for everyone to eat. I’m not going to eat it though because I don’t eat pizza. It’s weird. In the meantime, the house next door gets more and more cars parked on its lawn and there are more and more people partying over there. It seems kind of loud. I’m a little bit trying to distance myself from next door and go inside with this pizza. Inside is still so dingy and gross and I don’t really want to be in there. Someone says, “Hey look at this.” She shows me this instagram post where my daughter is doing a video and I’m horrified because she’s young and I don’t want her to have social media. She’s asking for money and is becoming a little business person on instagram. It’s a family friend who is a little erratic and is coaching her in how to do it. I’m freaked out. I start to think that my daughter is doing something that is not age appropriate but she doesn’t have any idea in her head that she can’t make money because she’s a girl or she’s young or she doesn’t have an education. She’s just doing it and making the money.",Rose,last_nights_dream

There’s an indoor pool, a bunch of different rooms with classes going on. It’s huge. The pool doesn’t even begin to take up the amount of space that it’s in. the ceilings are vaulted. It looks like there’s glass in the ceiling, but it’s nighttime. So there isn’t much light coming through. The light is artificial and overly bright. It hurts my eyes and I don’t want to have that bright light in my eyes all the time. I’m shielding my eyes as we walk around. We decide on two classes. We want to take a Pilates class and we would like to swim. There’s another movement class that sounds interesting. We’re in the lineup to put our things in the locker because we are going to swim first. There’s a woman who is the owner of one of the studios I stopped working for because she is so unethical. She’s standing there at the lockers. No one can get into their locker because she’s blocking them. She’s trying to sell stretchy jeans. Her pitch is that we need them to attend the movement class that we’re interested in taking. It irks me that she’s using this opportunity to sell her stuff. I wonder why she’s even here at this complex. I don’t begrudge her using all the opportunities she has to sell her stuff, but she’s making it sound like people can’t do the class unless they have these stretchy jeans. So all the people in the lineup that are dressed as though they have means and money are agreeing right away. They’re giggling like teeangers and just spending the money. The people who don’t have extra money or didn’t bring it with them or didn’t know are now backing away and unable to take the class. This is the part that bothers me, the thread of dishonesty. You don’t need the stretchy jeans to do the class. You can do the class in whatever you’re wearing. We decide not to do that class. We go back to the area we came from and do the Pilates class. We come out and we want to try swimming again. I’m looking over to see if the studio owner is gone and she is. We go to put our stuff in the locker and every locker we open has a pair of stretchy jeans in it and there’s nowhere to put our stuff. So we still can’t swim. We go back and redo the Pilates class because there are no other classes at that time. The rest of the dream is us wandering around. We can’t find our way out but don’t care too much. We’re still interested in doing a movement class and the schedule changes every hour.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

It was sunset. Instead of ""el chino"" there was a ranch for meetings and then a beach. At the ranch, there were many men and a man explaining something. The floor was made of Arena. And GFr and I heard Ake say that she had never happened that to him and I said that that's why we were from the neighborhood and the neighborhood is not forgotten. In front of the table that AKe and GFr were, LJe and I sat on some wooden chairs, without tables because there were no more seats at the tables.

1784,985,,24/11/2020,11/24/2020 00:02,"I’m walking down an alley between row houses. I’m with my husband. We walk by this one house with people gathered in the front. It’s a neighborhood block party. The front of their house is decorated with so many succulents of all shapes, sizes and colors, some in boxes, others growing like vines. I comment that “Snow and Shelly” would like it. But I mean “Hanna” and I wonder why I keep calling her Snow? We continue to walk a little further. I hear them laughing about their friends “Slow” which is their nickname for Hanna and Shelly together. Then my husband and I get to the end of the alley. There’s a curio shop with all kinds of odds and ends. There’s a sign that looks like a fish and you can tell that it maybe once said Carmel, but part of it is missing so you only see the C at the fish’s face and the E-L at the tail. Then my husband reaches up and touches an interesting looking tapestry. He touches the border and tells me to touch it, too. It’s a really soft silky hair and leather texture, beautifully crafted. My husband takes it down and brings it inside. There’s an older woman dressed in a white lace bohemian dress behind the counter. There are two dogs running around. The dogs go from being really well behaved to one reaching for my fist with his mouth. While the woman is helping us check out, another dog starts running through the store and is being destructive. The man who is her husband and owns the shop with her comes out from behind the desk and goes after the dog to get him and rangle him back behind the desk along with the other one. I look at the tapestry and it’s no longer a rug, now it’s a dead dog that has been taxidermied. Now I understand why the leather was so smooth and shiny - it was once a shiny short haired soft dog. I don’t want it anymore. She says it’s really good for spellwork, protection and keeping the negative energies at bay. The man comes back and says, “Yes it’s such a shame, the three dogs used to be a crew together. It’s a shame to see them separated now.” He is encouraging us to take it even though I’m apprehensive about having a dead dog in my house. Then there’s this yellow and white huge snake behind the counter next to the man. He taps the snake on the head and it starts to move. I can see its body starting to unknot from it’s sleeping position. It’s coming out from behind the desk and pushing the woman to the side. She stands back respectfully. I guess this is also one of their pets. The snake continues to unwind. The face kind of looks plastic but it’s acting real. I’m making sure to get out of the way. I’m trying to leave the shop and my husband is on the other side of the snake, also trying to get out. The snake continues to unwind and as it does, it is so huge, there is no tail in sight. Its body is filling every part of the shop. I can see the man trying to pull the snake back. I can see my husband trying to push through the body of the snake and trying to get out. Just as we reach the threshold, I see the snake open her mouth really wide and I see her fangs and tongue. The tongue is yellow and white and in the same pattern as the body.

I’m with my mom in the kitchen and my dad somewhere and my sister somewhere. My aunt is there, too. I guess the whole family that usually gathers for Thanksgiving is there. My mom is in the kitchen. I’m with her and we’re baking bread. The counters are already covered with loaves of bread. It smells so good! There are some artisan loaves that we’re just finishing up. We’ve just tried this new style of baking and we’re looking forward to trying it. I take those loaves out of the oven and place them on the counter. We slice some pieces of bread, sampling different loaves for the meal we’re preparing. I step out of the kitchen and walk down the hall. I go into my grandmother’s bedroom. This is when I notice the ceilings are really high and there’s a loft. Also, her bedroom is on the opposite side of the hall than it was in waking life. There’s a wall partition and around the corner is a big green bed, her bed. There’s a little area with toys - a little kids table and bright primary colors, a little hammer, balls and art supplies. She set it up for the grandchildren to play with. I see my aunt up the ladder on the loft preparing a couple beds for the family to sleep. There’s also a bed downstairs with a pink bedspread. We’re preparing the house so everyone can rest. I go out and see my sister and grandmother in the laundry room, which she also didn’t have in real life. They’re taking Christmas decorations out of boxes. They’re taking out candy canes that are individually wrapped in plastic, then wrapped again in bunches. My sister and grandmother are taking the candy canes out - they’re all different colors, rainbow, blue, purple, solid red. I don’t see the traditional red and white striped candy canes.

1786,1262,,24/11/2020,11/24/2020 00:04,"I’m with a group of women but I don’t know any of them at all. They’re younger, in their twenties and early thirties. We’re together on a boat, I think. There’s water everywhere. It’s clearly a group of witches. Most of them are just beginning to learn spellwork. I’m the only one there who knows how to do it. There are rituals happening or perhaps initiation. One of the younger women is guiding us through the process. I don’t know that I’ve actually received training and I already know how to do all of it and I’m just going along and it’s perfectly fine for me to be doing that. I don’t have any need to let them all know that I already know how to do all of it. I’m just there with them, watching and observing. Each woman is taking turns and we’re creating a circle. The woman who is leading all this is standing in the center and each woman being initiated is walking in a circle around the other woman and the rest of us are watching. I’m part of the crowd watching the younger woman in the center. As each woman goes and does her initiation and shows what spells she knows, she’s walking around the other woman in a circle. The thing is, we’re all walking on water. The boat or whatever we were on is around somewhere, but we’re off of the boat and each of us is either standing on water or walking on water. You can see the shore from where we are and it’s a rocky shore. Then it’s my turn to go and walk on water in the circle. There’s a dress I put on. This dress is a purple taffeta, shiny and stiff. The purple is a deep black purple and it shimmers with black. It’s very Victorain era looking with tons of folds and gathers and ruffles, but it’s not super girly, it’s quite elegant. I put this dress on and start walking the circle on the water. As I start to walk, my power starts to rise. I’m no longer hiding that I have power and know how to use it. The water starts to churn and with the other women the water was not churning. As I walk, the water starts to churn around and around. This is where I recognize that the dress I’m wearing is actually a dress of Helen’s, it’s a priestess dress imbued with power and I’m wearing it. The woman in the center who was leading us the whole time is a little startled because this hasn’t happened with the other women she was initiating. I have a little smile on my face because I know I’m invoking something that’s a little bit older than what any of them have ever seen and that I’m calling on the water elemental and the air elemental as the wind starts to blow. I can hear that Helen has shown up or her presence has shown up. She’s whispering in the ear of the woman in the center and the woman in the center is in awe. She thinks Helen is a guide from somewhere and she’s quite in awe. I know who it is and I can hear what she has to say and it’s all wise teachings, but the awe is not there for me because I know who it is. The woman in the center passes on as Helen speaks it as prophecy. I sort of grin and let her speak as I continue walking my circle and creating this water vortex that is spinning. Then my turn is over and it’s time for some of the other girls to go. This vortex I created with the water and wind stays and adds itself to the ceremony ritual happening. The woman in the center keeps babbling on about how wise and mystical this guide is. I say, “Yes, she’s quite wise and ancient and she’s very powerful,” knowing it was Helen speaking but what was channeling through her were the powers of Avalon that are very ancient and old. But I don’t tell any of the other participants what it is because it seems it’s over their head and this is a good first mystical experience for them. The dream ends with us dispersing.

I decide to go through a small town on my way home because there are people there I haven’t seen in a while. One of them is Cora. I drive to where I think she lives, knock on the side door and sure enough she still lives there and is happy to see me. She invites me in. We’re sitting in the kitchen at her kitchen table. I notice on one wall that she has a lot of record albums. Every fifteen minutes she goes over there and either flips one over on the turntable or exchanges it and gets another one out. She also has a lot of strange equipment piled in the middle of her kitchen floor. It’s all black metal. I know what one of them is but can’t figure out what the other ones are for. Maybe they’re for audio-visual tv filming because one is a large light, not the stem part, but just the light part, so it’s two feet wide and encased in black and is one of those really bright stage or camera lights that professional cameramen use when they’re filming a talk show or something. She tells me that she hasn’t seen me in a really, really long time. I say, “Yes, I know. I don’t really like to come back here because all the people do is drink and party.” She says, “Well, are you coming for Trina’s fiftieth birthday?” I say, “Well, I didn’t know about that, but maybe.” She writes the date down and tells me it’s going to be on April first. When she’s writing this down I say, “You know what? There were a couple of times over the years when I was going to call you but I didn’t have your phone number and it was always unlisted.” She says, “Oh, well I’ll put my phone number down here, too.” She writes that on the piece of paper. She says, “I don’t have yours either.” She gives me another piece of paper, it’s yellow and the size of a post-it note.vAs I’m writing down my number, I make a mistake and scratch it out, but it’s so small that there isn’t room for the correct number. I ask her for another piece of paper. She has a clipboard on the table with about fifty pieces of paper, but they have writing on them. She flips through about six pages and says, “Hmm, there’s no room on any of these pieces.Just a sec, I’ll be right back.” While she’s gone, I take my thumb and flip through all the papers because she only looked through the top two and it looks like the bottom thirty sheets are brand new and blank but they actually have writing all over them. Every square inch of the paper is covered in some kind of writing. She comes back with a very tiny piece of lined paper, like she just ripped it off something else and I put my number on it. While I’m doing this, she says to me, “Have you heard about the anti-priestess movement here?” I say, “No, what’s that?” She says, “Well, there’s a group of priestesses living out by the sound and they’re trying to change things in this town.” I think to myself, “Wow they must really have their work cut out for them because there’s so much dark horribleness in this place.” She’s telling me that there’s a movement against them coming in. I just say, “No, I didn’t know about either one.” Then I start wondering where the sound is because the sound is a particular geographical location. I’m trying to picture in my mind a map of this area and where there might be a sound. I’m wondering what it is about the sound that would attract a group of priestesses to create a settlement there. I’ve asked her for a drink of water which I’ve finished and now I need to use the washroom so I ask permission to do that and she says, “Yes, it’s fine.” I go in there and am just about to sit on the toilet to pee when I hear the footsteps of a big person coming up the side of the porch. I notice that the window is open. I try to close the drapes but it’s windy and they’re blowing open. So I’m trying to pee as I’m reaching up and trying to hold the curtains closed with one hand and my skirt up with the other hand. I manage it. I finish, wash my hands and come out. I tell her it’s time for me to go but it was good to see her. She gives me a hug and says, “Come back anytime.” I get in my car. I carefully place her phone number and dates she suggested I come back on the dashboard of my car. I wonder if maybe I have time to drop in and see my friend Randy before I go home. I put his address in the GPS in my phone to see if there’s time. He lives quite a bit out of the way.

I’m walking around the arena. I see one of the managers from the restaurant where I used to work, Blake. I don’t approach him yet. I go into one of the change rooms. Nobody is in it. I see one of those dropdown beds that you push into the wall. I drop it down and I lie down on it with my baby and I begin to nurse her. I finish that. She’s happy and fed. I put her in a sling attached to my body and open the arena door and go out onto the ice. I’m skating. I skate around and around and around. I’m enjoying myself. The baby is liking this, too - I can see her smiling face inside her hat and she’s laughing. A good deal of time passes and I think that’s enough. We go back and I open the heavy arena door, it’s kind of hard with a baby in a sling in front of my body. I step down a step and go back to the change room. I stop because Blake comes in the door and tells me that I shouldn’t be doing that in the arena without something from the drug store, I can’t remember what. I say, “Oh, I didn’t realize that.” So, I put my coat back on and the baby is still in the sling. We walk out of the arena, down the long ramp, down a few blocks to the drug store. I’m in the drug store and looking at all these baby products. I think I don’t need any of these things. I leave the store and go back to the arena. As soon as I arrive, Blake comes back out again and he’s questioning me. I am trying to tell him that I know what I’m doing, but he’s agitated. He follows me into the change room. I want to lie down again and nurse my baby. He’s telling me I’m doing a whole bunch of things wrong. I say, “Well, there’s four pillows on the bed, it will be fine.” He leaves but he’s exasperated with me. I nurse my baby again and then she’s tired so I let her rest. I pile the pillows up around her. Because Blake has made me question myself, I stand there for a moment and think, “Is there any way that she would be ready to start crawling and get out of these pillows?” I’m positive that she’s not ready. I leave the change room and go out into the arena foyer. Now there’s a big lineup and it’s no longer an arena. At the end of the ramp where the door opens is a pier where a ferry backs in so people can drive onto it and go across the lake. While I’m standing there, I see one of my son’s friends and his mom and they’re waiting in the lineup. There are two different lineups about two feet apart. I’m standing between them. They both have a different agenda. The mom is going one place and her son is going another place. They’re arguing because the mom is saying one thing but her son is contradicting her saying, “That’s not what it says in the Bible.” I wonder when he started being interested in that because he certainly wasn’t all the years he was friends with my son. I think he deserves to be listened to. I ask him a couple questions about why he’s making that statement and why he has to go this way. He explains it to me. I think that makes sense and I guess really the only way to find out is if you actually get on the ferry and go to the destination and see if all those white rocks are actually there. I wish him good luck or the best or safe journey or something. I turn to the mom and say, “I think he’s going to be okay.” She doesn’t talk to me, she just keeps looking straight ahead and she had the whole time she was standing there. I turn around and walk back through the lineups and up the ramp, back to the arena and into the change room where my baby is still sleeping. I decide that I’m tired and I lay down beside her, put my head on the pillow and go to sleep.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream2

1799,649,,28/11/2020,11/28/2020 00:01,"Nightmare. I was at a retreat at a dinner table and we were taking turns to get our meals. I went to get mine and saw this teenage boy and he said hi. Later when I went to the bathroom I saw him and his friends and younger girls joking around. Later I saw him sitting at the table alone. I went to the bathroom and all of these black beans started coming out of my mouth, not like vomit, but just like opening my mouth. There was this string attached around my epiglottis and wrapped around my teeth and I pulled and pulled and finally got it out and all of these beans kept coming, too. I went to go tell the boy he didn’t have to watch me anymore because I ripped it out and it was meant to be kind but he was so angry with me that I went to the bathroom and more beans came out. Then I went to go tell my husband and he was a hybrid of my ex Rory and someone I can’t place. I thought I could tell them what happened but when I started to he was putting arms around me to cuddle me from behind like I was a little spoon and instead trying to touch me sexually. I had to say I was sharing something vulnerable and he stopped but I could tell he was judging me for taking the cord out. I woke up feeling like there was a weight on my back and all hot and scared.

There’s an African American man on the other side of the wooden fence who comes around every now and again to check on us. He’s good friends with Gemma, maybe they’re lovers. I’m working on her but there are a lot of distractions and I don’t feel like I’m really offering a good session. I ask her to turn on her back. She keeps getting up and responding to his questions. He is asking her if she’s going to the dinner later. I’m included in the dinner invitation. I sort of finish and she says, “Thank you, that was really great.” I’m wanting feedback but there isn’t time. Some other things happen and it’s time to gather for the group dinner. I go by myself. A black man is checking names at the gate. The dinner is in a courtyard with a lot of tables set up. He allows me through. The guy behind me is also black and he can’t come in because he’s wearing velcro on his shoes. He walks away. People come. It’s kind of strange. There are some interesting relationships between all the people but I’m not quite sure what they are because they’ve all been living in community for so many years. I did something or said something earlier in the day that wasn’t entirely correct when we went swimming at the beach. I swam too closely to another person or said something i wasn’t supposed to say. There was something in my food or drink that knocked me out. I wake up in a big cage wrapped in this solid red Japanese raw silk kimono and bolster. I was passed out in this cage. People are walking beneath me and they’re much larger than me. I’m either really far away or I’ve been shrunk. A guy is pointing at me and talking about me being a rare form of butterfly. I stay still and pretend I’m asleep until they walk away. Then I get up and explore my cage. It’s quite big and extends back behind the metal display portion open to the public below. There are pipes that drip water into a bowl. There are dishes of food for me. The pipes are beautiful, covered in old copper. It’s an ornate room with wood floors. There’s a wood staircase with dark wood banister. The copper pipes are following the staircase. I get an idea: If they’re going to trap me, I’ll take away all the water. I do something with the pipes where I store a week or month’s supply of water by closing off valves. My plan is to put them back together when I’m done. I turn on the hot water very strong and am pouring it into the bowl, letting it all pour out. As I turn the water on, it’s black and is about to fill the bowl, but the drain is good and so it doesn’t overflow. Just as the water is nearly gone, a friend from Swamiji’s ashram comes in and she’s polishing the wood banister. I ask her why I’m here. She says that I misbehaved and didn’t follow the etiquette. I ask about the others. She says, “They’ve been banished and will never be able to return. You’re lucky because he decided not to banish you so you can stay.” She notices that the pipes have been taken apart and she teasingly reprimands me for taking them apart. I say, “Oh, I’m just rebuilding them and looking at the design.” She laughs. I’m hoping she doesn’t notice the dripping water and that my little act of rebellion goes unnoticed and people don’t realize that I’m the one who took the entire community’s water.",Ana,last_nights_dream
1801,1489,,28/11/2020,11/28/2020 00:03,"“Court Date” I’m in a house I used to live in and it was the top floor of a bungalow and in the basement was a doctor’s office. I’m in the back bedroom. I’m sitting on my bed and I have a laptop in front of me. I’m also curling my hair, which is extremely strange because I have naturally curly hair and I’ve never used a curling iron in my life. I take a piece of my hair and I put it between the mouth of the curling iron and I pull the curling iron all the way to the end the way I’ve seen other people do, which actually straightens my hair, then I wrap the curling iron around my hair and I hold it and then I unwrap it. Instead of my hair being curly, it’s straight. I’m wondering why I’m doing this and don’t understand why I would do this. I have this dream consciousness that is confused and then there’s another consciousness that is also saying, “This doesn’t even work! It doesn’t even curl my hair the way it’s supposed to!” My son is only about eight years old in the dream and he’s occupying the other back bedroom. I know he’s there because I can hear him moving around. Since I hear him moving around, I’m trying to collect my thoughts on the two documents I’m writing on my laptop so I don’t lose my train of thought because I’m going to do a board game with him or something. I want to see what he wants to do now that he’s awake. It’s morning. I have been up for quite a while. He has just woken up and I can hear this because there’s movement. I look on the laptop and I’ve got one document open where I’m trying to collect my thoughts and focus for an upcoming court case with my son’s father. The other one is something that I’m writing as a creative project that I’m not sure is for school or just enjoyment. I click into the court case one because that one’s more important and has a date coming up soon. I’m trying to sort out the threads in my head of how the court date arose, what the reason is for it. It’s really hard to sort out because I don’t want to make it into an attack on my son’s dad’s character, yet every reason I would put in there that I would say anything about is also going to be something to do with his character. I think this is why it’s so hard to write. If it wasn’t for his character, there wouldn’t be a court case. But he continues to lie and doesn’t follow through on any of the custody conditions. He just doesn’t do them then lies and says he was. So I typed five words out then keep deleting them. I close the laptop and get up to leave the room, but the door opens and my son is standing there. I ask him what he would like to do today. He says that he wants to go out to someplace. I get up and we go out into the kitchen to have breakfast first, but his dad is standing there. I’m confused as to how he got in the house. He’s in the kitchen and he’s making a piece of toast or sandwich or something and is carrying it out into the living room. He lies down on the couch and puts the sandwich on his chest and turns the tv on. I feel that this is somehow a violation of not only the custody arrangement but of my own personal space. Then my son goes into the living room and is watching the television, only it’s guys out on the town and it's really inappropriate for an eight year old boy to be watching. Then I’m thinking, “What kind of arrangement is this?” I could have sworn he had his own place. I’m standing there in the kitchen trying to sort that out in my head. I’m wondering why I don’t remember this. Then I think of twelve other times recently where he’s been in the house and I start to doubt myself and think maybe I don’t have my own space and maybe he does live here and maybe this is what the court case is about because we still have to have personal time with our son. But since he’s making the sandwich and turning the tv on, it’s eroding my son’s attention and he’s just going over to the tv and now I’m not getting my own time with my son because of what his dad is doing. I walk back down the hall to the bedroom. I go back to the laptop because I think maybe there’s a document to help me remember whose day this is supposed to be and what the arrangements are because I didn’t think he was living with us. As I’m looking for that, my son comes into the bedroom. I say, “Oh good, you’re back.” I close the laptop and think maybe I don’t have to sort this out. I say, “Would you like to play a boardgame?” He says yes. I say, “Good.” I think I’ve got this pinball machine in the closet that would be really interesting to play plus it would be good for his hand eye coordination and I like that it’s not television, it’s the opposite, it’s something you kind of do with your body. I say to him, “Let’s just play this for a few minutes. Then we can go out for a walk because it’s snowing out and it’s really pretty.” He says that he would like to do that. I show him how to pull the big plunger back, then watch it hit the ball, then the ball goes up and hits the other lights. I say, “Then you have to move this way, then you have to move that way because you want the ball to hit the paddle, then you use the flippers to hit it. We’re trying to get it to go into this part of the tube.” He does and he tries but he doesn’t pull the plunger back far enough and he gets discouraged. I say, “That’s okay, here try it again, it’s alright.” But he only pulls it three times and gets discouraged again and wants to go out and lie on the couch with his dad and watch tv. I feel really defeated by this because that’s all his dad does. I tell him, “Well, your dad’s not supposed to pick you up at four, so let’s go for a walk, let’s go outside and walk through the snowflakes.” But then his dad comes down to the room and opens the bedroom door and bends down and picks him up and takes him back into the living room. Now I feel really resigned. I sit back on the bed, open up the laptop, and from my own memory, I’m typing out what I remember the custody arrangement to be. Every time I type a sentence, the computer erases it. There’s something wrong with the computer. Then I think that maybe if I record my voice and do text to talk, that will work, then I’ll just fix the typos that those things always make after. I'm trying to do that. Then I hear my ex going out the door. I hear the front door shut. I look out and he’s taken my son and gone. So I go out the front door and think that at least I can go for a walk now. I go out onto the back porch. It’s a beautiful sunny day. My phone rings. It’s my friend who lives in Holland now and I haven’t talked to in years. I tell her, “Oh, hi!” I’m excited to hear from her. I notice she has a Dutch accent now and she didn’t when she lived in Canada and I think that’s from being in Holland for so long. She asks me what I’m doing. I say, “I’m just about to go for a walk, but I’d really love to talk to you. Can I call you back later?” She says, “Well I only have time to talk right now.” I notice as I’m talking to her that my son is on the stairs at the bottom of the deck. I’m wondering what he’s doing there because he was supposed to be with his dad. I tell my friend, “I actually can’t talk to you right now because my son is here.” She sounds really disappointed, but I promise to call her back. I hang the phone up then these two men come walking up the back porch and I realize that they’re for the doctor who lives in the basement because this happens all the time between the hours of 8-4. It’s a man and his twelve to fourteen year old son. They’re walking together and the dad’s taking him to the doctor’s office. They’re about to go in when the man looks at me and says, “Bathe me.” I think, “What?” I’m not going to do that!” He pulls up a chair and another for his son. His son sits in one of the chairs. He sits in the chair and crosses his ankle over his thigh and sits back a little bit, then he crosses his hands over his chest. Then he looks at me and says, “If you come here I’ll tell you why that’s funny.” His son has a smirk on his face and so does the dad. I think he’s genuinely trying to tell me a joke. He looks completely harmless and his body movements are such that he’s still trying to keep the time for his appointment. I think, “Should I let him just tell his joke?” I start to walk over in front of him so he can give me the punch line, then I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I’ve been eating them through most of this dream. I leave the black woman up to her own devices and I don’t know if she goes up on stage at some point or not. I get in a van that reminds me of the scooby doo van. I still have the berries with me and I’m sitting in the front seat. Someone else is driving, I don’t know who. I’m watching us drive through this cartoonish town and am still eating these berries out of a bag and off a twig. The twig looks like a curly willow twig. At some point there are worms and maggots in the blueberries and I’m totally grossed out and horrified. I take the berries and set them down in a little black cauldron like the ones we burn incense in and it’s glued to the dashboard of the van.

1804,1490,,29/11/2020,11/29/2020 00:02,"“The Domo” I’m trying to teach my class and there’s so much noise that I can’t even hear the sound of my own voice. I’m not sure what building I’m in, it’s got a sloped ceiling but the ceiling is also really high and there’s a little bit of slope to the floor. It’s almost like a lecture theatre, except there are no chairs. It’s supposed to have really good acoustics but it doesn’t because there’s so much background noise, but it’s not the students in the class that are talking, it’s students in the hallway and crowds of people outside. I can hear construction, jack hammers and buzz saws. It’s a cacophony of sound and so loud that I don’t know if I’m speaking or not. I can’t start my class. I go to the hallway, open the doorway and ask the people out there waiting to go into another class if they could please be quiet because they’re so loud. As I’m saying this, I realize there’s not supposed to be any talking in the building. So they say they will be quiet. I go back into my class. As soon as I start teaching, I can hear them again. They’re playing sports in the hallway, yelling and cheering. I can’t start. Then I’m sitting off to the side, I still have to sit there for the full hour, but I’m not teaching because I can’t. I see my brother. He’s not in the class, but he’s wandered up from the construction sight where people are building something. He’s taking a break. We talk for a few minutes. I feel really good to see him in my heart, I feel comforted by his presence. Then, it’s quieter. It stays quiet. I say I’m going to start trying to teach my class again. I ask him: “Will you stay?” He doesn’t practice yoga, but he says, “Okay, I’ll try it this time.” There he is. I move my mat from the middle of the class up to the front as though I’m a participant. This way I can be beside my brother. My voice, because of the design of the acoustics, it doesn’t matter that I’m not facing my class because the voice is supposed to carry anyways. So I start teaching and it’s so nice and quiet. I get through the sun salutations and a few other postures, then all the horrible noises start again. I try to teach a little bit more but I can’t hear my own voice. I do a few more things just continuing on, hoping the class can see me and just follow along. This works for about five minutes, then the whole cohesiveness disintegrates so I stop. By this time the hour I was supposed to be in there was over and I’m free to go. I ask my brother, “Even though it was only a part class, what do you think? You looked like you were doing everything just fine.” He says, “Yeah, you know it is a good class. But I’m not going to start doing it every day.” I laugh because I know he wouldn’t do that anyway. He goes back to the construction area and I go out the opposite door of where the students are going into the noisy hallway. I exit out of the building but it’s not really a hallway, everything turns into glass. There’s a glass vestibule and a door to the outside which is a docked area with a walkway and piers but I don’t see any ships. It’s good to be out in the sunlight and air. I see the husband and two kids of the two studio owners I work for. I walk towards them. I’m supposed to meet them because we’re all waiting for her. While we’re waiting, one of her kids is squatting down on the dock and looking into a hole in it. I’m curious at what they’re doing, they’re trying to pull out a bug. I walk over closer and actually see that he’s pulled out one already and it’s just sitting there. I wonder what kind of bug it is. I squat down closer to see and I’m just watching, I haven’t said anything to him. He has some kind of tweezers and is trying to pull out another bug and he’s working away at it for a few minutes. Then he says to me, “Can you see it down there?” I get a flashlight out from the back of my cell phone and am shining it around in the hole. I can see something but I don’t know what it is. Then he says to me, “Here,” and he hands me the tweezers. “Can you try?” So I get down a little closer on my belly. I can see something down there now. I want to be careful I don’t injure it. I put the tweezers around it gently and start to pull a little bit. Then I take it out. I have it just behind it’s skull, around its neck. I set it on the dock. It’s just sitting there, kind of like it’s stunned, probably because of the light. It was quite dark down in the hole. It’s got a very very very dark green body and a gold head. It has a band of gold at the top of its tail and the rest of its tail is green, a greenish black. I say, “Oh what is this?” It doesn’t have scales, it has the body of a beetle, but without the hard shell on the top so it’s soft. It’s tail is reptilian. He says, “It’s a domo.” I say, ”Hmm, I’ve never heard of that.” We look at it a little bit more. It has really beautiful black eyes and it looks like there’s a soul in them. Probably it’s three inches long. I say, “Okay?” He says yes. Then I put it back in the hole. The other things that he’s pulled out look like dead bugs, probably that the domo has fed from. I just use the side of my hand to brush them back into the hole. I give the son back his tweezers. We stand up. The daughter says something to me but I can’t recall now what it was. We move off to the side away from the dock. We’re still waiting for their mom to come. We sit. I don’t know how we got inside the building but we are. We’re in a different part of the building. The kids are playing together and I’m sitting down. The husband comes over and starts talking to me about something. Then he says, “Just a sec, close your eyes.” As soon as I close my eyes, I feel this big particle start to fall on my eye and face. He blows on my face. I feel it move along my eyelashes. Then he says, “Oh are you upset that I did that?” I’m thinking it was a little bit weird having his breath so close to my face. I don't think he meant anything intimate by it. I think he was just having a dad reflex, like when you say hold still and blow to interrupt a thing that was going to fall in your kid’s eyes. I say, “No, it’s okay.” But then I look at the thing and it’s like a big giant salt crystal, probably a quarter inch by quarter inch like a triangle cube. Now they’re falling all over the place. There’s a bed that’s not mine and somebody is supposed to be lying in it. These salt crystals are all over it. I look and there is a handheld vacuum off to the side. I say, “Hey I’m going to use this and see if I can get these things off the bed before they fall all the way down to the bottom.” I turn the vacuum on and suck up these things. But there are so many of them that they are spilling out of the vacuum as quickly as they’re coming in. I dump these things out of the vacuum. I open the vacuum up, clean it all out, put the vacuum together and turn it on. I put my hand over the nozzle and feel that it has good suction. I go back to the bed and try to suck these into the vacuum. I pull the mattress away from the side of the bed so I can get in there. I do this a few times. Now I realize that I do need to sleep here. I don’t want to lie on these hard crystalline things. I’m trying to get them off the bed. I’m fiddling with this and trying to clean it. Then I see that the studio owner, the kids’ mom, is back. Something completes. I don’t have to wait anymore. I’ve done what I’m supposed to do and can check out now.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

They’re both retired, they don't have jobs, they don’t work. The reason I’m hiring this detective is because I don’t think they’re watching my son very well and I don’t think it’s entirely safe. They’re watching him for me because I’m working and I don’t have time to watch him and I need them to watch him for me while I work to make money. They’re in a pool on vacation or at the place they live. It’s odd that they’re together because they don’t really know each other in real life. The detective watches them and sort of gets involved and is telling them how they’re not doing a good job watching my son. My son is about two or three in this dream. Both of them, my dad and ex-father-in-law, are taken aback at being lectured by this man who’s telling them how to do their job. Neither of them can figure out who has hired this detective. They each think the other has hired him, so they’re trying to point fingers at each other about it. I’m observing this whole thing. I’m on the pool deck somewhere but they don’t see me. I show myself to them to check in on my son. They’re both trying to convince me as to why the other one is not doing a good job. I eventually say, “No, I’m the one who hired the detective to show me that you guys are not doing good. The reason I hired him is because the two of you are neglecting my son a bit and you’re both talking shit about me and the fact that I’m not around to watch my son and it’s because I have to work because no one else is supporting me and you two old white guys have a whole ton of privilege and never had to stay home to watch the kids and don’t know what it’s like to be a single mom and have no idea how hard it is. All I’m asking for is a little bit of help and you two can’t even give me that. I hired a detective to check up on you.” My ex-father-in-law’s eyes start to tear up while he recounts how it was for his ex-wife to watch the kids and work a full time job and how hard it was for her adn how much pressure was on her. He starts to sound somewhat remorseful. I’m like, “Yeah, exactly. But why are you crying? You had everything easy your whole life. Your crying tears for her now doesn’t make a difference. Your compassion and empathy are a lot too late. You guys are already divorced and your kids are grown and you have a chance to make it up now with your grandson while I do all the work.” My dad is nodding his head in agreement with all this but also looking a little chagrined himself because he was also not doing that great a job of watching his grandson either. I pay the detective and he wanders off. There’s a little bit of what feels like validation and me being seen by these two old men with the understanding of why I’m having them watch my son in the first place. It’s like they’re having a renewed commitment to being good grandparents and not talking shit about their grandson’s mom to him. The dream shifts.

I get into the classroom and the teacher sees me and is like, “Pick a spot.” All of the tables seat six or more. There are only single spots left at a couple tables. I am trying to find one that’s not too crowded because they all seem too crowded. I finally find a table where I sit down and go to take the test. I don’t know any of the answers. I notice from the other test-takers that it’s an open book test so they have their books and are allowed to look at their books while they’re taking the exam. I don’t have my books. In fact I didn’t even know I was going to be taking a test, I thought I was just coming to class. I know I’m late and have ten minutes left to take this fat test and I don’t have enough time. I answer maybe two questions before the teacher says time and I have to stand up and turn my test back in. I’m completely disappointed and frustrated with the whole situation. I don’t remember why I was late. I just know it was something unavoidable and I thought it was okay that I was late because I thought it was just going to be lecture and I wouldn’t miss too much and I could just get someone else’s notes. The dream ends with me turning in the test, totally disappointed, knowing I just answered two questions of maybe fifty. The teacher is not budging on giving me any more time at all.",Rose,last_nights_dream

In the dream we are at the ocean. We’re at the oceanside and there are these large rocks. She is driving a Jeep and it’s one of those cool ones that can basically drive up cliff faces, at least in my dream it can. She is driving over partially submerged rocks. I am not inside the Jeep with her. I’m climbing up the rocks and in fact most of the friends are climbing up the rocks. She’s just having fun playing with this vehicle. One time it falls over on its side, but she just pushes it back over. Another time it goes up and over backwards, but she is safe and pushes it back over. Part of me is a little bit anxious, but also like, cool Jeep. then the dream shifts. I’m in a neighborhood of some sort in a rural area. The lots are really big at least two-acre lots between houses. We’re on a culdesac. It’s nighttime. I think I have my kids or there are kids with me, but I’m not sure whose. I’m getting dressed up to go to a party at one of the other houses or maybe it’s just outside somewhere because a tent is set up. I think my parents are there but I’m not sure. There are adults and kids. I’m getting dressed in a leather harness. It looks like how you tie ropes down a leg in Shinbari or Kinbaku where it looks like a cage down the leg, but instead of me having it made of rope, it was made of leather strips joined together with rings and I had to buckle it on. I’m buckling on a red one that goes from my ankle to my thigh and I’m admiring it with my leg out in front of me. I think the kids are there, or somebody, and they’re like, “Could you hurry up? You’re taking a long time and why do you need that?” I’m like, “Because I like it.” Then I get a black one. I go to put the black one on over and the balck one doesn’t have the same space intervals as the red one so it looks a bit funny. I put it on but don’t like it, so I go to take it off. There's something about me thinking that there’s too much stuff on top and keep it simple. Then I take off the red one before I go out and convince myself that it doesn’t look good and I should take it off. That felt kind of yucky and I was like, “Why am I taking off this thing that I like?” I liked it in one minute and then the next minute I didn’t like it and was all judgmental about it.

1819,1491,,02/12/2020,12/02/2020 00:02,"“The Songwriter” I have a friend and he writes songs. On this particular day, I go to watch him play his songs with his band at a venue. It’s like a small theatre, so it’s not a large venue and it still has the theatre seats in it. I guess this is where they would normally have plays, live theater, but tonight they’re hosting a band. I don’t sit at one of the seats though, I’m standing at the back. I’m leaning against the back wall and just closing my eyes. I’m listening to the lyrics because I’m familiar with them. I’m really just wanting to enjoy how they’re paired with the melody. We’re about four songs in. He sings this one and it’s so emotional. I can still feel it wrapping its fingers tightly around my heart and squeezing it because I feel so much grief. I’m thinking that I should tell him where that song came from. He knows that I found it and I really like it, but I didn’t tell him that I actually know who wrote it. I decide that tonight’s the night. He sings the rest of his songs. The band did a really good job and I’m really happy for them. They finish their concert. Some people from the audience, fans I guess you would call them, have questions and are interacting with them for a little. Then that starts to thin out and he walks over to me and says to me he’s finished and, “Let’s go.” I say, “There’s one other thing I want to tell you before we leave.” He says, “What’s that?” I name the fourth song in the lineup that he sang and say, “There’s something I want to tell you about that song.” I reach into my pocket and take out a really old piece of paper. It’s yellowed and a bit brittle, and there are some water marks and such on it. I give it to him. It’s folded in half twice. He unfolds it and reads it and says, “Oh, where did this come from?” I say, “I found it in your friend’s binder that he left at my house one time and never came back to pick up because he’s dead.” It’s a friend that my friend, the Songwriter, used to be friends with as well, but they had a falling out, an argument, and his heart hardened to his friend and they hadn’t made amends when he died. Because my friend the Songwriter's heart was really hardened, he hadn’t really grieved his friend’s death. That’s why I think it’s time and my friend is strong enough to know. When I gave the song to him and let him know it was a song for him, he had assumed that I wrote it. However, it is a song for him but it was written by his friend after they had the fallout. It’s about how much he misses him. When I tell him who actually wrote it and where I found it, at first he shakes his head in disbelief and says, “No way, he wouldn’t have written this for me.” I say, “Look at the age of the paper. Look at the writing, this was the original copy.” I can see it’s slowly dawning on him the truth of what I’m telling him. I can see the grief starting to shake his body as all of that soaks in and he feels it and accepts it. It’s almost an apology from beyond the grave. I’m thinking,” How could there be any other result here other than he’s going to forgive himself and his friend and now have this song that is so meaningful?” He’s crying. I can see it moving through him like I thought it would. Then he turns around and I give him a big hug and he’s squeezing me and crying. Then he says, “Thank you for showing me this.” We leave the theatre and start to walk out of the building. Then I woke up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream1
1820,1492,,02/12/2020,12/02/2020 00:03,"“The Protective Glasses” I go back to the same theatre. This time I’m with my daughter. We’re watching a band that is her choice to watch. I’m wearing one pair of glasses and she has a different pair. There’s some kind of new protective coating on them that protects us from radiation. There’s some scepticism in the overall social culture about the effectiveness of these glasses. Hers are like the kind you can get at the drug store with different strengths of glasses, like 1x magnification or 1.5 or 2 and you can just walk in and buy them off the rack. Mine are prescription because I think the protective coating works so I got it on my glasses when I got a new pair this year. During the concert people are complaining that their eyes are hurting and they’re closing them and stuff, but we’re fine. Then a couple of people start to ask because we’re standing there and we’re not rubbing our eyes. Our body language is such that a couple of people notice we don’t seem to be experiencing any ill effects. So one or two people have asked my daughter: “What are those glasses you’re wearing? Are they protective somehow?” She says yes. She describes that hers are from the drug store and mine are prescription. They’re like, “Hmm, wow, maybe they do work,” kind of mutterings. Then my daughter and I just turn around and go out the door we came in. we go down the hall and then there’s an indoor pool. It’s the same thing where we’re not blinking our eyes rapidly because the chlorine is not bothering our eyes the way it does when you’re in an indoor pool area. I sit down to wait for her. She has her swim bag with her and she has a lesson. I know it’s going to take half an hour so I wander around outside for a bit and go for a walk rather than just sitting there. I come back in after only twenty minutes just to watch her the last ten minutes. There are a lot of kids lining up and jumping in one at a time. It looks like they’re doing one of their tests. The swim teacher has a clipboard and is writing. I look down the line and don’t see my daughter. I look at the clock and it should still be her lesson. I go into the really heavily chlorinated area. I can’t stand being right there near the pool. I catch her teacher’s attention and say, “Where’s my daughter?” She says, “Oh she’s in there, she’s in the pool.” I go back outside so I’m behind the glass and I’m waiting for her to surface out of the pool. A few minutes go by, I’m scanning the water, there’s no daughter. I’m starting to get scared and thinking, “Are they so busy testing everyone that they’re not noticing that somebody might be in trouble?” I know my daughter can hold her breath for a really long period of time. Then the feeling of unease just overtakes any of the things my brain is saying. I go back in there and instead of asking her teacher, I go right up to the edge of the pool and get down on my knees and look over. The lifeguard is blowing the whistle and the teacher is saying, “You’re not supposed to be in here! You can’t do that!” I say, “I’m looking for my daughter! She’s underneath the water. She’s not surfacing.” They look and she’s not in there. Now I’m really scared, like, “What the heck? Where is she?” The teacher is looking alarmed as well because she thought she was in the pool, too. People are starting to look for her. She’s definitely not in the pool. We’re not as anxious now. They continue on with their tests and I’m sitting there waiting. I see my daughter emerge with one of her friends. She’s coming from the back of the pool. They’re talking and giggling like teenagers. She says to me: “What?” I say, “What do you mean, what? You were supposed to be in your lesson and everyone has been running around looking for you. You should have let them know where you were. What were you doing?” She says, “ Oh I was just with my friend and we were doing something.” I tell her that she should have let someone know and besides that, she was supposed to be in her lesson not where she just was. I’m upset with her.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream2
1821,1493,,02/12/2020,12/02/2020 00:04,"“The Bar” I’m sitting outside on a patio outside of a bar that looks like the Central Hotel. I’m sitting with a few people, some are part of the employees that worked there before the current owner bought it and some of them belong to the new owner. There’s a conversation going around the table about ideas on what to keep from the old owner’s arrangement of things, how to blend them in with the new owner’s ideas and flushing out the ideas of the new owner. We’re outside. I think I’m about to work there and have definitely not worked there in the past. I’m not really sure what my role is here other than I’m part of this conversation. A couple of the old things that occurred there are live music and wedding receptions. The staff are discussing those. The new staff think that the kind of music that accompanied the wedding receptions is dated. They give a few examples of songs that came from the 1920s that they are quite certain people don’t really enjoy now and so that needs to be updated. There’s also the issue of the furniture in the establishment. It’s old and dated, but there’s the idea that they want to keep some of the 1920s architecture and design of the building and maybe instead of having it be plain because it’s not that it’s worn, it’s that if it were actually the 1920s and you had more money, then the furniture would look more art deco and be more stylish. But because whoever owned the bar then was economically impoverished the furniture actually represents that. We’re talking about if it’s possible to upcycle the current furniture to make it reflect something a little more lush and festive but still of the 1920s era or should all the tables, chairs and counters and everything be taken away and start fresh? The other conversation at the table is the style of music. I’m actually contributing the idea of having an open mic night to see what kind of local talent exists in the area, then waiting until the open mic has run for maybe six months or a year before deciding on a new house band because that might open up the options a little wider. Apparently during this conversation, or maybe I was already a part of the new staff team, I’m clear that I’m working here for a little while now. Our conversation turns into a work shift. We go inside the building. It’s really, really dark. I can hardly see where I’m going. I’m wondering if we’re going to be allowed to wear time period clothing during our shifts. The first thing I do is look to see if there are any closets. There are rooms upstairs as is typical of any bar type of establishment in the 1920s to have rooms overtop where people can sleep. I’m looking for the side stairs that go up because I’m on the hunt for clothing that’s been left behind from the 1920s. I have already found on a coat hook a wedding dress from that era. I’m looking for overcoats and men’s clothing and I’m hunting around. I’m looking in the closets, but it’s really dark, so I have to feel with my hands for hangers or hooks or fabric. I’ve collected a few things but now I realize that my efforts aren’t really efficient because I’m spending so much time trying to see where I’m going. I decide to go downstairs and see if there’s a spotlight I can use for this. I go down the stairs, through the room with tables and chairs for receptions, then into the area that has been more recently used for customers to have snacks and alcoholic beverages and watch a band. I come down. There’s a girl working, she’s a checker at the front door and bartender. There’s a counter in front of her. She takes people’s coats and hangs them up. That’s why I think there might be coats that people have never ever claimed. It’s also a bar, a very tiny bar. They have a very limited selection of alcoholic beverages, so she does both jobs. They just have basic liquors and pop to mix it with, it’s disgusting. I think they’ve got some kind of dusty old popcorn maker that you’d find in movie theaters of that same era. That’s the selection of things to eat and drink. She has some other things under the counter that have been left there for a long time. When I approach her I’m asking, “Do you know if there’s a flashlight or a big spotlight leftover from the stage somewhere? I need to create some light in the back room.” She says, “Hmm, I don’t know, I haven’t seen one but that doesn’t mean there isn’t one down here.” So she starts to pull things out from the shelf. There’s a wicker basket full of small items, so I take that and I’m looking through them. There’s a tiny pair of scissors that look like barber scissors. One of the waiters comes up and he says, “Hmm, that is a strange pair of scissors.” I say, “Yeah, isn’t it for men’s grooming, for hair?” He looks at it and opens and closes them a few times the way you would air cut with scissors and says, “No, I don’t think that’s what it’s for. I think it’s for ladies to do their cropping underneath.” I’m like, “Oh, that’s what it’s for?” Then they joke, “Yeah, you don’t want that hair to get too long.” Then he sets the scissors down. They’re still looking through stuff and enjoying themselves, figuring out what some of these old items are for. I’m still on the hunt for a light. There actually is a band playing in the back. I go towards the back where the equipment is kept. I’m looking for one of those big spotlights. I see that the band that’s playing has two drummers, one at the back of the little tiny stage and another at the front. I think that’s different and unusual. I’m standing there to listen to them for a bit. I actually know the drummer, it’s my son’s music teacher. I didn’t realize he played the drums. He’s singing and he also never sings, in fact he's really against his own singing. I’m waiting to hear what his voice sounds like and I want to hear the band because this is really unique having two drummers like this. He sees me and smiles in recognition. There are mics set up beside him so I know he’s going to sing but it also appears as though he’s stalling. I’m wondering if it’s because I’m standing there and he’s always made such a big fuss about not singing before. It looks like he’s delaying it.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream3

They are very appreciative, a female cook especially.  Later, I meet up with the female cook and am given a reward. Every night a guest received a gift of some kind. She though it was fitting that I have been randomly selected after having tipped so much.  I had a job interview coming up with the cook's brother. She called him and began praising me highly. She heard that an amazing 19 year old had come to her and that he would be perfect for the job. She said things about me being kind, and also a Christian though not like many Christians she had met. I was surprised that she thought I was 19 when I was 26. Do I really look that young?   She hands me the phone telling me to say my birth date.

1825,1266,,03/12/2020,12/03/2020 00:01,"A journey to a house. I’m coming to a house from somewhere else. This house is huge and it’s quite grand, almost like a mansion but not quite as big. It’s very spacious and there is a lot of open space. The house is a house that someone is letting me and other people stay in. i’m the original person that the house owner let stay and I don’t know if I’m paying a really reduced rent or what. I’m the person whose name is on the lease or rental agreement. I have a bunch of other people living there with me because it’s a huge house. I’ve been on vacation somewhere and have just come back to the house. Josh is with me. He’s dragging his feet and is not excited about being back in this house. He keeps complaining about it not feeling like home and being too big. He’s also the only male in the house. The other people I’ve let the house out to are all women. When we walk in the door, there’s a bunch of women, all blonde and middle aged, very nice. They’re doing the dishes and cleaning up the kitchen area with the concrete countertops. It’s very open with windows that look out. I realize I have some things to clean up and am looking through drawers trying to find towels to mop up the mess. Then my friend, Nani from high school who I haven’t seen since she left high school her Junior year to move to California. She’s wandering around and is not talking a lot, she doesn’t have a whole lot to say. I go and follow her to the space she’s occupying. She’s taken up the den or the parlor. She’s put a bed in it and it’s super cute, I love the way she decorated it. It’s open to the rest of the house but you do have to go around a corner set of stairs to get to it. I’m wondering how she feels about not having a lot of privacy. I say hi to her and go back into the kitchen. Josh is there moping and sitting on the steps. The stairs are kind of crazy, a really big set of stairs with no railing on one side. You go up the stairs and hit a landing then turn and go up a second set of stairs. The second set of stairs is between two walls so there are rooms on either side at that point. The first part has no railing at all. We go up and our bedroom is up there. He’s sitting on the stairs and I think he comes up the stairs with me. I’m noticing as I go up into what would be our bedroom how empty it feels and it doesn’t actually feel like home. There are other bedrooms where other people are staying as well. The house is so big and it seems like it keeps getting bigger or there are more doors. I come back down the stairs and walk back through the kitchen and dining room area. The dining room has a big dining table and a big chandelier over the top. Off the dining room is another hallway and there are more rooms back there. We walk back there. This is where the two blonde ladies are saying, they have a space back here. It’s pretty comfortable. I’m looking and I realize the panel has a door and I suddenly see it. Josh is still moping somewhere and he’s on his phone and complaining about how he wants to go home or he wants to go where people know him. All I can think is we have this great place and there’s an adventure to be had because I just realized there’s a doorway into something else and he’s not ready. The words that keep coming through my head are, “You’re just really immature and moping like a little boy so why don’t you do that because clearly you need to do that. I’m going in through this door to see what’s there.” I open up the door. Initially I just poke my head in to see what it is. I can see round hobbit doors and I’m like, “Oh, this is a portal into another realm, I can totally tell.” I look over my shoulder and see Josh being mopey and sad. I leave him and go in. it’s this hallway with all these doors off it and also a common area which is basically under where the stairs would be. The wood grain seems a bit shimmery and mirage-like. I walk in and run into all these women, but they’re not human. They’re all different kinds of fae. They’re talking to me and I’m like, “Hi, I didn’t know this was here. Where is this? What is this? How are you staying at this house?” They’re like, “Oh we just rent with you, too.” I’m like, “Okay.” They’re super happy to show me the place. There’s nor weirdness about me as a human being there. One of them has bronze skin and curly hair, one of them has a baby. The one with a baby is the one who talks with me the most. She keeps dropping her baby. She sets him down and he sits for a little bit but then his head gets heavy and he flops over backwards. He nails his head on the floor which is concrete but he doesn’t cry. She just picks him up and sets him up again in another precarious position. I’m like, “I don’t think you want to put him there, he’s going to flop over again.” Sure enough he falls again and smacks his head really hard and fusses a little bit, but she calms him. I don’t know if that’s good for him but she doesn’t seem concerned so I just leave it be. She’s the one who explains to me who they all are. She keeps calling herself and the other people/fae the name but I can’t pronounce it so I just forget. Then I start asking her, “What are you all doing here?” When I had walked from the dining into that back room the house started to feel weird and I told her, “Oh there’s an entity in this house and I need to smudge and clear it out.” Now that I’m talking to this woman beneath the stairs in fae land or wherever I am, and she’s like, “Oh yeah, we’re here because we keep that thing at bay. But you guys feel it more in that part of the house.” I’m like, “Oh well, how do I get rid of it? It doesn’t need to stay here and I know I can get rid of it. Whatever the dark pall that is hanging over the house just needs to go.” I think Josh is depressed and that’s part of why he’s depressed. She says, “Oh well, you can clean it out, but we mostly do the work of keeping it out in here.” I’m like, “Okay awesome. I’m still going to try and get rid of it because it’s not necessary and it doesn’t feel good and it makes the rest of the house feel really yucky and uncomfortable to be in.” Then the dream ends here because I don’t remember coming out of that part of the house, I think I just woke up. I have the sense that everything is okay and this part of the house is where I want to be and I don’t know if I want to return to the other side.",Rose,last_nights_dream
1826,1494,,03/12/2020,12/03/2020 00:02,"“Chalk Paint” I’m in a car and it’s winter. The roads are really slushy. You can feel it underneath the wheels of the car when the slush is so thick and heavy that it kind of pulls the car in the direction you’re not steering, so it’s a real struggle to let it go straight. I pull into a parallel parking space at the side of the street that looks very much like a street I recognize, which is supposedly the widest main street in Canada. I get out of the car and I’m standing on the sidewalk looking up. It’s an old railway town. The stores are made of the red clay brick and they go straight up because they’re tall and skinny and probably have three levels to the stores because they have to plus an attic full of old junk. I’m reading the names of the stores because I need some chalk paint. None look like they’re likely to have chalk paint, although one looks like a little bit of a possibility. I’m just about to walk over to it when I see someone I know from the old yoga studio I used to work at. She asks me what I’m doing standing there. I tell her I’m looking for chalk paint. I realize as I’m saying that she actually lives here. I add, “Do you know any place that would have some?” I briefly describe the project I’m doing and I tell her the look I want it to have because I don’t want just plain white chalk paint or anything like that. I want seafoam green and a chalky turquoise. She says, “Yes, I know the perfect place. It’s one block down that way and it’s called Moody’s.” I thank her and walk towards the direction she indicated. I’m standing in front of the store now and I have my son with me. He’s about ten in this dream. It doesn’t look like a place that would have chalk paint, although she said that it does and she goes there all the time and their selection is fantastic and she spent a few sentences endorsing it. So undaunted, I go in anyway. There are kids all in the front of the store and they’re unsupervised kids probably between the ages of six and eight, maybe nine. They’re throwing toys up in the air and boys are engaged in a cooperative game of something they just invented. There are a few younger kids just staying back out of the danger zone. I think this can’t be the right place so I go out of the store, read the sign and see that it’s spelled the same way, and so I re-enter. Now I’m looking for someone who is running the store. I see an elderly man and it kind of looks like he’s wearing a paint smock, so I make a bee-line for him. I ask him if he has chalk paint. He says, “Yes, I do. There’s a selection right over there,” and he points. I think, “How could I have missed this?” I’m looking and there’s a little shelf, probably about five feet tall by about two feet wide by about ten inches deep. It has three boxes in it that look like there might have been a small canister of paint in them at one point, but they’re all opened. I think, “Well that’s why I missed it because it also has a ramshackle assortment of kids toys on it. However, I walk the way he indicated thinking that maybe there’s something more here than what I’m seeing. But no. There’s one small pint of paint in one of the boxes and the other boxes, you can tell there used to be paint in them but they only have the accessories that would have come with the paint. Miraculously, the one little pint of paint is an antique white. I think, “Well this might work.” But I still need the other colors. I’m not really finished. I walk over to the counter with the paint and there’s a lineup of parents in front of me all asking him questions about their kids. My son is not in the room anymore, but he’s ten and I’m not worried. I think he must have found something to do while I’m doing this. I wander into the back room and there are more kids playing cooperative games. There’s a shelf full of kids blocks and he’s over there and helping some younger kids build something big out of blocks. We make eye contact and I shake my head like, “No we’re not ready to go yet.” But now I know where he is so I walk back out of that room and stand in the lineup of parents at the counter. When it’s my turn, I say, “Is this all the apint you have?” I’m wondering why would my friend tell me that this guy has a fantastic selection and it’s excellent. He says, “No, I’ve got a few more boxes behind the counter.” I look and they’re identical to the open ones that had been on the shelf and they’re also open. As he pulls one out I notice that the paint is not the color that it said on the box. I feel an internal eye roll happening in my own body. I think this is going to take forever. Instead I describe the two colors that I want: “I want a chalky turquoise and a chalky seafoam green.” He says, “Well I have this one called mint green.” I look at it and it’s far too candy-like. It looks like a wedding reception mint. I say, “No. That's got too much blue in it.” Then he pulls out another one and says, “How about this?” It’s an obvious blue. I say, “No, I’m sorry, that’s too dark.” Then he says, “Here, well I have these samples.” It’s a board that has a fingerprint of paint colors on it with the paint colors underneath. I think we’re making progress. I actually find the two colors I want and say, “Yes! It’s these two. Do you have these?” He says, “Just a minute.” He rummages underneath the counter. He’s gone and it’s like there are stairs leading down to the basement. He’s gone for about half an hour. I leave the room I’m standing in because I’m in danger of being pinged on the head by some flying toy. I go into the other room where my son is and I just sit there and watch the kids playing. About half an hour rolls by and then the man waves at me from the doorway and gives me the thumbs up. I tell my son it’s time to go. I go back to the counter and sure enough he has the two colors of paint. I pay him and we leave.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

In the breezeway I meet my neighbor Patrick and his son. I continue my way toward the woods but get  disoriented and find myself by the pool. The water is cloudy and overflowing slightly from previous rainfall. Patrick and his son are swimming together and I join them jumping into the water.

Our mom was worried but Dad told her we would he fine. William, Carson, and I were all carried out several hundred feet from the shore, but I was the farthest out. We decided to return to the shore. The swimming was difficult but we could make progress between waves when the sea was completely calm.  We got back to shore where we each got into kayaks. I wondered if I could catch the waves in my kayak and ride them out. The waves were coming in the wrong direction.   I felt something crawling on my foot and was sure it was a spider or scorpion. I wished someone had hosed out the kayak before our vacation.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

We were all seated in the dark blue cushioned metal chairs found in many modern churches. It felt like we were in a catholic church though we were outdoors. Toward the end of the show, children began a ceremony and all of the people had to move to the back rows. I was in a row where I wasn't sure if I needed to move. The rest of my family had moved back, but some strangers were still in my row. I moved back and watched the children. There was a whole row of them in front of us between the ages of 6 and 14.

1831,1495,,04/12/2020,12/04/2020 00:01,"“The Warpath” I’m living with a group of people outside on the plains, like a meadow but the earth is soft. We live and sleep outside. We’re on the way somewhere, we’re traveling. We’re tired and we need to stop and rest. We have adults as well as elderly people and some young kids in our group as well. I’d say when the dream starts there are probably about one hundred of us. We gather flower tops and berries and roots as well as small animals and that’s our food. I don’t get the small animals, but somebody does. We sleep on the grass, too. We’ve got wool blankets that we wrap ourselves in. There’s a group of indigenous people and the first time we come into contact with them, they have deep reddish brown horses that they’re riding. They just come in and they sweep through and it’s so quick and so violent that we’re in shock, we’re stunned, we don’t even react. Some of us just run and others are caught up by them or killed instantly. A couple of the women are carried off. We don’t know where to go to hide from them because there’s just more of this wide open plains area. So what we do instead is we’ve got these iron spikes, they’re like pegs that are about nine inches long. The next day we drive them into the ground around the outskirts of where we are so that the next time they come, they ones on foot will step on these and so will their horses and hopefully that will deter them from the mad sweep that they do really fast - they won’t be able to do that and that will give us a little bit more time to get away. All day long we spend driving these stakes into the ground so they stick up about six inches from the ground and about six feet apart, but they won’t be able to see them because they came at dusk last time and we know they’re going to do that again, probably at dusk. That night when we sit down to eat they don’t come, nothing happens. We eat, we sleep, we wake up again. A few nights pass like this. We’re pretty sure they’re going to come back. But during that period of time while we’re waiting, I have a few conversations with some of the kids, like the almost pubescent boys. There’s a group of three or four of them that sit there sullenly the way teenagers can be though they’re not yet teeangers. One of them in particular doesn’t like how the adults in the group are handling this at all. He’s becoming bitter and angry. I’m asking him how he thinks things should be done differently. He says that we should just get out of there. I say, “Okay, where would you have us go?” Then he doesn’t answer. There’s another one who is upset by his attitude and when I leave the conversation they get into a fist fight. Me and a few of the others go in and break it up. We know we need to do something differently and there’s that generally consensus starting to thread its way through our group. Now there’s not a hundred of us anymore, there’s about seventy because thirty were killed or taken the last time there was a raid. It’s that night that as soon as we finish eating, it’s just dusk when things are grey, when the natives come through again. They’re slowed down a little bit by the spikes but they quickly figure out they can go around them. More people do manage to get away and they only pick off about twenty this time. But this reduces us to fifty. The next day some of the men say they’re going to scout to see if there’s any other place we can go. They go into the forest. The forest is really thick and this is the issue. Do we keep moving forward on the plains or do we risk what’s in the forest? So that’s where a couple of men go to see if we can shelter there. But we also want to keep moving and we don’t want to just sit there hiding in fear which is where we might get stuck if we go into the forest. We’re thinking about what else we can do to defend ourselves from these raids. There’s also the elderly people who really aren’t capable of moving much farther at this point. We continue spending our days driving these iron spikes into the earth, trying to spread them around so we have a complete circle around us. That night when the men come back they say they’ve got good news and bad news. They tell us that they think there’s a different way of life moving forward from here, but we’ll have to change how we relate to each other as a group. One of them says, “Each woman has to pair up with a man and stay with him forever. The one man will be responsible for the survival of the one woman.” I think this is ridiculous. What’s going to happen to all these elderly people? There are no men for the elderly women, so who’s going to speak for them? I’m also disgusted and thinking, “Ew there’s not one of you in this group that I want to stay with forever.” I’m suspicious about where this idea came from. The two of them maybe cooked this up together when they went into the forest and I don’t think it’s a solution and won’t help the group survive as a group, it will just pick certain people out of it and leave the other ones to die. It really upsets me. That night the natives come through one more time. Only this time they only carry off one of the women. We’re sitting at a group of about forty-five people left. I’m avoiding picking any one of the men tonight. In fact, I’ve decided to stand up for the elderly and I will feed them at my table and give them seats there. The teeangers, the younger boys that I talked to the other night, also seem to agree with me and they moved their sleeping mats to where I’m sleeping with these eldelry people.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I had made my way to a room on the upper floor and was surrounded by other members who were sure that I had done something treasonous or heretical. I don't remember whether I was guilty of any such crime.  They were going to arrest me so I put my hands behind my back so that they could tie me up. I was showing weakness by doing this as I wasn't sure that they were planning on tying me up at all.  They did tie me up and took me to an empty holding cell with a stone floor. I had some friends who were on my side and planning to help me escape. We must have been part of a resistance group. Two men entered my cell, one was my friend trying to rescue me, and the other was my husband. I was apparently gay in this dream. My friend had convinced my husband and to help him but has somehow gotten him to admit that we were married which was against what the religious authorities approved of.

All these materials were set out at all these places and we had to find activities. A lot of it looks like low function activities that I might bring for a low function OT group at work. I was trying to navigate in between these rows and there was no room to get in between them. People kept commenting on that. Then at some point I took a break from that dream and went to another dream. I was with my ex Rory and the dogs and we were running around the park, then just walking. This lady let her dog loose. One of Rory’s dogs, Trevor, isn’t friendly, so we were trying to keep him from hurting the dog and all the dogs got loose so we were chasing them up and around and climbing trees and then going up a tree. There was this group of people and this lady I knew a long time ago (somebody I’ve cut cords with in the past) and she was being irresponsible and just laughing while we were trying to save the dogs. Then I returned back to the other dream and I was trying to collect the materials I might need. Someone told me I should take this one thing and it was a picture with a cross on it to take to work. I went to go get that and tried to make my flight on time but I kept leaving and trying to return because I forgot something and was busy and cramped walking against the tide of people in the other direction.

1836,1267,,05/12/2020,12/05/2020 00:02,"I’m at the shore and I’m with a couple of different people who keep coming and going, none of whom I know in this reality. There’s a little outcropping of lava that goes out into the ocean and the end of it is where people have done ritual or left offerings to the ocean and it seems to be a very common practice in this place because there are a lot of offerings there. I’m watching these two younger men in their late twenties or early thirties talking to each other in a brotherly way. They’re bashing each other and it’s getting a little bit heated but there’s obviously a bond between them. One of them is saying, “I said the prayer and I put the spell out there and i left the offering out there.” The other brother or whoever it is says, “I keep hearing that you just have to wait. You have to be patient.” I’m watching the waves and the waves are very frothy, where they keep hitting a lot of white water. The two brothers dive in no problem and I see them navigating, they’re not worried about rip tide or getting pulled out or getting smashed on the rocks that are all around. I think they clearly know these waters and this area and they’re navigating this just fine. Then I go somewhere else and I don’t know where. But I come back to this beach. Now the brothers or maybe they’re friends are arguing again. They’re arguing with a white woman with short curly hair cut to her jaw line, blonde. The brothers have darker skin and dark jet black hair. The one who put the spell and offering out at the end of the outcropping has a goatee. She’s kind of haranguing the one who put the offering out there. She’s like, “Why do you even believe in that shit? It’s total bullshit.” He looks at her and is like, “What are you talking about? We know that you’re one of the most powerful psychics in the town.” She’s like, “No I’m not. This is total bullhit. What you’re doing is bullshit. You’re being foolish.“ He asks, “Okay, what did the wizard say?” She stops and drops into a trance and goes, “Merlin says to wait.” She stops haranguing him and gets really quiet then turns around and leaves the beach. He’s like, “Yeah I know that’s what he said because that’s what he said last time, too. Have patience.” I’m watching all of this and I’m not interacting. I feel a little bit of disbelief because the woman was so adament about how spells are stupid and magic is dumb and it’s not real and there’s no such thing as intuition, but then she just drops in and reads what Merlin says to the young man. A little bit of time goes by and I’m still on the beach. The two friends/brothers are still there. There are a bunch of young kids, some moms and their babies, and it’s like a family beach day. The kids are amybe between three and eight. I’m watching the water. The waves are getting bigger. I’m watching the waves pull back and one of the times, they pull back really far and uncover a picnic table. So there’s a picnic table in this area between the rocks where you can get into the water if you want to. I’m like, “What? The water is high enough to cover a picnic table? That’s kind of weird.” The little ones go in. The two brothers are watching and kind of keeping an eye on them because it’s getting a little bit rough. I watch and see a sneaker wave come up. The brothers are watching these kids and I’m like, “Uh oh, this is not going to be good.” The sneaker wave comes and it breaks right over where the kids are. Now I’m like, “Oh shit, they’re all going to drown.” I see the same thoughts go through the one brother’s head. He’s like, “Everyone grab onto my hands, we’re going to go deeper in.” I’m like, “They’re going to drown, you can’t do that.“ He’s like, “They’re going to drown anyway.” I grab one of the kids’ hands and am like, “No they’re not. I’m going to grab them out.” He tells me that I can’t run against the pull of the water because it’s like a tidal wave. I’m like, “Yeah, watch me.” But I can see down the beach that there are moms and babies on the other side. The beach is actually backed by a cliff and there’s only one section where you can get down onto the beach and you have to go up and off to the right and climb up this somewhat steep hill to get up onto this grassy lawn area. The rest of the beach is an alcove with a bunch of cliffs. Moms and kids are nestled up against the cliff supposedly enjoying the beach. I’m like, “Oh no. Everyone is going to die.” I think I get one or two kids’ hands and for whatever reason I have superhuman strength and the pull of the water is not stopping me. I’m dragging them as fast as I can out of the water, up the beach, up this little embankment where it’s not as steep, then up to the top of the cliff. I’m looking down and I see the wave come and it just covers everyone and it splashes up on me because it hits the cliff and does one of those huge sprays. I’m horrified because I know everyone died. The water pulls back a little bit and comes rushing back in. But then it’s suddenly totally calm, there were only two waves. Now it’s completely calm but the water has filled up to almost halfway up the cliffs so the beach is completely gone. I look down and I can see the water is totally smooth, it’s crystal clear and I can see all the bodies. There’s a little girl in a pink sweats outfit and her sister laying on their sides but dead, drowned. I can see further off more bodies of the other children, a mom and her baby, and all these bodies under the water. There’s no sign of these brothers but I know that they somehow got out. Whatever happened to them, they didn’t end up in the water. I can see under the water the outcropping where the rituals were being done and the offerings were made. It’s just so eerie to see all this death. I don’t even know what happens to the two kids that I saved. I don’t know if they ran off or what. There’s so much water and it’s so eerie, there’s clearly magic stuff. It’s very Neptunian because it feels very unreal even in the dream. I turn around and turn my back on the whole thing. I walk across that grassy lawn and up into the little town. In the town, I see a bunch of guys in their late twenties, early thirties. They’re totally hoodlums, like street kids. I walk up to a building where you can get a meal. It’s shingled on the outside and it’s small. It kind of looks like a food truck but it’s actually a building. It’s run by a mom and her female partner, so lesbians. I order some food and I’m watching these guys hanging around and talking to shit to this woman and making her life miserable. They’re total punks and I’m expecting them to pull a gun at any moment. Then they start fighting with themselves. They leave and I start talking to that one brother again. I don’t remember what we’re talking about. Then he leaves and his brother, the one he was arguing with, shows up with one of those punk kids. They’re talking right outside this food place. They are suddenly like, “Fuck you and fuck everything.” One of them has a glass bottle and slams the glass bottle on the side of the shop and smashes it. The other one does the same thing. There are pieces of glass everywhere and crap all over the front of the building. A police officer comes and it’s a black female. She’s totally resigned and she’s not going to do anything. I’m like, “Why aren’t you stopping them?” She’s like, “To do what? Put them in this prison system that doesn’t help them? They’re not going to listen to me anyway. And I could possibly get in trouble for stopping him because one of those kid’s dad is high up.” I’m like, “What?!” The brother I’ve been talking to turns out to be her boyfriend and he’s like, “Yup, we’re just going to go home. I’m taking her home. She’s tired. She’s exhausted. She can’t keep doing what she’s doing. It’s a no-win situation for her.” I just look at them and I realize it’s true. I look back at the owners of this food shop and they’re like totally beat down, too. Even the kids being fucking punks, you can tell they’re so angry and they’re doing it because they feel like they have no future. I think this is such a fucked up dream! Everyone is completely oppressed in this dream except for me, but no one will hear me or listen to me and they’re not listening because they assume I don’t know what they’re talking about and also I’m just a woman who doesn’t know what she’s talking about. They think I don’t know what I’m talking about because I haven’t lived their experience but also I’m female. The whole dream is totally frustrating. But it ends with the one brother taking his police officer woman home and the words he says are: “Babe, let’s go take care of you, you need some self care.” He takes her home and she’s dragging her feet, she’s so fucking exhausted but also beat down and tired. I can see that at least they have ech other and they do as much as they can for each other just like the lesbian couple who owns the food shop. They’re a little bit resigned but they’re still doing what they can do.",Rose,last_nights_dream

We were walking down a street at night as we made our way to the venue. I carried two large jugs of alcohol, one whiskey and the other rum or something darker. I held a third object precariously as my hands were full. I tripped and fell and watched as the bottle of whiskey hit the pavement. By some miracle, it didn't break and I asked Carson if he would carry something for me since he only carried one item.  We got to the party early and deposited our food, drinks and gifts. I looked around but didn't recognize many people apart from the hosts and the Davidson family. I was glad that I did not see L. D.. I mingled a bit among the crowds.  A video began playing in which Stephen announced their nee baby and requested any financial support that we could provide. He said that despite what we might think they were really poor and needed money for the child. I remembered having given them money the two previous years and decided that I would again give $100.  I noticed that I was barefoot and was a little worried this wasn't acceptable, but we were in a carpeted room and many others wearing sandals and flip flops. We sat down at a table with Stephen and Sarene. My mom was there and spoke to Sarene.  Sarene looked a lot like Pam Beasley from The Office. The dream transitioned and I watched as a murderer took her dead body and arranged the arms and legs, folding them elegantly around the protruding stomach. Somehow the baby inside was allowed to develop though the mother was dead. Toward the end of the pregnancy the killer disemboweled the body and out rushed a torrent of blood and guts. It was horrible and I willed myself to wake up. Once awake, I wished that I had remained asleep so that the dream could finish its narrative.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

As part if the therapy that our mom was doing, she had a part of her self she called ""version b"" which was more attractive and confident. She told him that her b version would be willing to have sex with him. He paused thinking because this was quite the serious proposal. He told her that he would but only with her real self, not version b. Our mom hesitated but eventually agreed. Something was mentioned that if one wanted to, one could have sex on the coffee table if one first put down a towel. I was holding the folded towel.  They retreated to our mother's room where they shut the door and played loud classical music as they had sex. We tried not to listen.   I saw them lying in bed fully clothed which was odd as they had already finished. Everything was also in black and white and in cartoon style. They spoke to one another, then I saw the next page of the cartoon where they were pulling their pants off. It was all still frames, with the pants movement indicated by a comical ""shwoop"".   Then in color and at a cartoon village of these harmless, childish dwarf creatures. They lived on the water and needed their help to cross. It was like a TV series episode. We were at the river where a boat was destroying all of the bridges so that we couldn't cross easily and the story could continue.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

At the end, they stated that they had to put a new bag for catching debris on the back of the mower. We saw them zipping the bag shut. The lawnmower bag slowly grew into a larger container, almost like the covering over a fancy trailer.   My dad complained to the worker that he hadn't asked them to replace this part and that there hadn't been anything wrong with it. They tried to placate us by sending an attractive, blonde waitress out to flirt with me. She kissed me, but I wasn't going to let this strategy work. She kissed my dad as well, but he rebuffed her attempts. I was a little jealous that she had kissed him too as it made our kiss meaningless.

The weapons were helpful but the firing rate was very slow compared to the number of zombies and how quickly they moved.

1847,1268,,07/12/2020,12/07/2020 00:01,"I’m with a friend from the pole studio and we’re trying to do pole dancing. Wherever we are the ceilings are super low or the poles are all cut off at like three feet and you can barely get on them. My friend is tiny but the poles are even too short for her and it’s not even a possibility for me. We’re both running around looking for a pole to buy that’s longer or a studio to go where we can practice. It’s just not manifesting, the poles are not there and there’s no place to workout. We’re in a place with a lot of other people. I want to say it’s a marketplace and there are buildings with restaurants. We can’t find what we’re looking for. I dream some more but don’t remember what it was. Suddenly I’m with a Native American man. He’s wearing a hat and cowboy boots and a jean jacket and jeans. I’m wearing my cowboy boots and jeans and coat. There are a bunch of us but I don’t recognize anybody I’m with.He has a hawk that he nursed back to health. He has the hawk on his shoulder and is releasing it to fly. I get the sense that the hawk will be back as it flies off because they’ve bonded somehow. I’m walking with a staff and the others have staffs, too. We’re in the forest somewhere. He’s showing us how to be in the forest. I remember him saying, “You have to get a shovel with a long handle but the handle is two feet so when you lay it down you know your measurements by the length of your square hole the handle of the shovel.” I don’t know why that’s important but that’s what stuck in my mind. These people, poachers, see the hawk and try to shoot it. The Native American man stops them from shooting. I’m aware now that all of us in this group are protestors and we’re protesting capitalism, basically. We’re trying to re-establish connection with the land so we are all part of it and have our role. We leave the woods and head to an actual protest. We’re on city streets and there are stop lights. The protestors are there because of a parade. The parade is weird with all these children doing performances. As the people are talking you can hear the basic brainwashing that’s happening with these young kids and how they’re teaching them to look at people based on their skin color and judge who they are. I’m like, “Uh are we going to go in and stop them?” but the man is like, “Nope, we’re just going to listen and we’re going to make food.” We’re making food to bring. There’s a table with potluck dishes on it. We have our own and it’s all native foods - blue cornmeal tortillas that we made by hand. I’m stirring up a dish with rice and avocados and some other things and it looks delicious. We’re leaving the food there for people to sample and to give them an example of something that’s different from what’s being taught and told about at this parade. We’re doing a silent protest. I’m freaking out because it’s children that they’re brainwashing at this parade. I realize we can’t protest in a normal way because we would just scare the kids. It’s heartbreaking for me to see the brainwashing that’s happening. We were doing our food demonstration across the way from this glass building. The building goes up ten or twenty stories. I go into the glass building with the group. I am not sure why we go up into the building, who we’re seeing or if we’re still protesting. I kind of break away from the group. The group is showing people how to pick up trash and clean up after themselves. I can see in this room a doorway that I have to go through. I go through the door and there’s this younger dad who’s maybe in his mid-thirties and two little boys, toddlers. The dad spits some trash out onto the ground, some gum or something. I lose my shit because that’s what he is showing his kids, this throw away culture. I see him hit one of his kids. For whatever reason this is the absolute last straw for me. I walk through the doors and grab this dad by his head and I start yelling at him and shaming him. I have magic powers and am like, “You have magic powers. We all have magic powers and it doesn’t take very much energy to keep your space clean. You cannot do this.” I’m using my magic powers to make him pick up the trash and put it in the trash can. I finish yelling at him and tell him to take care of his kids. I walk back through the doors to head back to the group. Thi dad is like, “Oh, I have magic powers? I’m going to show you my magic powers.” All of a sudden he starts this sand storm. He pulls sand out of I don’t know where. The sand storm is blowing through the entire building and it’s hurting my people and other people. He’s just so enraged, he’s lost it. He doesn’t care who he hurts. I’m horrified because I’m the one who caused this and none of my powers are stopping the sand. I can’t get the sand to stop. I go back into the room and tell him to stop. He won’t stop. I finally go, “Okay wait. Tell me why did you hit your son? Why did you just throw that trash on the ground? What’s really going on?” He stops and starts to break down and talks about how he and his wife are having a hard time and she won’t talk to him and he hasn’t touched her in months. The reason he has the boys is he knows she’s stressed even though he has to work all the time and it’s stressing him out. I start to see his pain and the sand stops. I hug him even though I was so mad at him earlier. I tell him I understand and ask, “Are you two seeing counsellors? Is there a way that you can reconcile?” He’s in tears at this point. The little ones are nearby but they’re scared. I scoop them up. I talk him through it and he’s so hurt and wounded. We’re having an actual conversation. I have moved from rage and scorn and discontent to compassion in this process. While we’re conversing we’re still in this glass building and I see this man walk in. He’s an older man, he’s bald and he’s wearing all black. He says to me, “It’s nice to see you again, Rose. you better leave now.” For whatever reason I see him and am like, “Oh my god, oh no.” I just run out the glass door, leaving everyone and everything behind. I run down the stairs. People are taking the elevator and I skip the elevator to run down six or so flights of stairs in this glass place. I get out the front door and go across the street. I’m in a towel, I don’t have my clothes on and don’t know when my clothes came off. I turn around and look to see that I’m standing with a bunch of bystanders watching this building. It’s clear that something is happening. As we watch, something explodes and all the glass in the building shatters. Floors are dropping out from under people, the glass walls are shattering and the building is starting to collapse. All my people are still in there, I didn’t warn them and don’t know why. I just knew that when this man showed up it was time for me to get out and leave so I did. I watch for a little bit as everything collapses. I’m holding this towel around me and I leave. I realize I don’t have any support at this point. I think there is cash or something stuck on me or I found a shirt that wasn’t mine and there are credit or debit cards in the pocket. I know I need to get more clothes, that’s on the list of things to do. But the first thing I do is go and buy food. The only thing I buy is coffee ice cream with big coffee beans that aren’t even ground up. I’m eating in a safe place where this man can’t find me. This other homeless guy is hovering around me. I’m like, “Here, have some of this ice cream, I don't eat straight coffee beans, it will make me sick.” I need to get clothes but I’m so scared and so upset about leaving everyone. I don’t know what to do now. The dream ends with me in this alley trying to get the homeless man to share the ice cream with me. A man and his son walk up to me and ask me what I’m doing. I’m pretty incoherent. I haven’t seen them before in this dream but I know them from somewhere, they’re part of the oppressor group.",Rose,last_nights_dream

I was wearing only my pajama pants but everyone else was dressed similarly. I stopped an elf wearing a green kilt and asked him where I was. He told me I was in the land of the elves. I asked him what I should know and he said that I should find my purpose in being here but remain no longer. I walked for a ways making little progress. I asked another traveler what lay ahead. He told me a city. I asked what I'd find there and he told me he didn't know. He'd fulfilled his purpose there and no one could say what it was like now. I moved on. I saw a turn off to hot spring baths where one could be healed. The sign to the right read, ""Healing"" and the one to the left had a question mark. I stopped to rest in the one of the hot baths. A little silvery head was floating above the water. An animated spirit. ""You know these waters won't heal you, don't you?"" He asked cheerfully. ""Yes,"" I answered,  ""I'm only resting for a moment. Why are you here if you know?"" ""I know but I still can't stop myself from hoping.""  I left and saw candles lit along the path to guide travelers. I went on for a bit u till my path was blocked by a ghost. I asked him if I could pass but he made no answer. I put out the candle next to him and he vanished.   I walked onward until I saw a turtle waddling slowly ahead. I asked him if I could help him and he cheerfully accepted. I picked him up and hugged him to my chest. Surprisingly I was going faster carrying him.  How does this work? You see, speed here is additive! I may be slow but my speed still adds to yours and we go faster. Our spirits forces combine.  A small path diverged to the left amd I set him down and we went our own ways.  My foot became stuck in the mud and I could not keep going. I waited for a traveler to come but there was none. I called out quietly button answer. I tried to shout but could not raise my voice. I let out a scream for help and felt a womans hand on my shoulder. She pulled me free. I turned to her and asked why she hadn't helped me before. I felt ashamed for presuming so much from her and I tha jes her and carried on.  I came to an old man who stood by another portal this time leading home. I asked him if he was the ruler here. He said heavens no he was only the portal keeper. I knew it was time to come home but I asked him how I could go back with Doug. He said that I already knew the answer.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

There was a patient I’ve had dreams about before (about driving around in circles in a yellow van and another strapped down in makeshift restraints). In this dream I walked in and the attending was taking vitals - it wasn’t the one that works with them at all on the unit and it seemed off because attendings don’t take vitals. I could tell the attending was nervous and there was tension, like the attending just wanted to leave the room. I tried to engage with them and we went outside and there were big balls splattered with blue and red paint and we kicked them back and forth; and they liked it because it looked like blood. They were asking me personal questions that I was trying to avoid. Eventually I excused myself and went to sleep in the next room.",Vera,last_nights_dream1

We had lots of nursing assistants on the floor and different security guards. I didn’t know any of the patients but one of them asked me if I could do yoga nidra for the group. I thought about sharing with the patient. I have to do something that people can focus on and take into account all the different functional levels etc. (my clinical reasoning) and I didn’t end up saying that to them. I started designing a group that would meet all the functional needs including this person‘s preferences. It was like going inside the mind of an occupational therapist. All the staff wore masks and because there are so many staff which is kind of unheard of recently because people have had to call out sick we had to make sure we moved out of the nurses station so we could maintain our appropriate distance.,Vera,last_nights_dream2

I said there was a dolly built into it and she was like, “Oh you’re right but how are we going to get it up the stairs to the spa? Another person was there but I don’t know who.

1855,1269,,09/12/2020,12/09/2020 00:04,"I’m in a house or a school for children. It’s got a couple stories and is big, almost like a compound with multiple buildings. The kids are younger, between the ages of seven and ten maybe. I’m there to do some ghostbusting. The kids are pretty oblivious. Some of the teachers are a little shady - they’re doing their thing but know stuff is afoot. I’m in the cafeteria/kitchen and everyone is eating and I’m sitting in a chair. These cats keep climbing up into my lap. Inside of the school is kind of old-fashioned and a little dark, it doesn’t have good lighting. The kitchen is huge and open. On one wall is an old-fashioned stove you can heat with firewood like a bread oven. There’s a big apron sink against the wall and a huge wire candelabra that hangs from the ceiling. It’s a mix of medieval kitchen updated to early 1900’s and still totally functioning. So I’m sitting in a chair and watching a lot of these children. I think they might all be girls. They’re at this huge square table where they’re all eating. Maybe there are twenty of them if not more. I’m sitting in a rocking chair. Everything is okay and there’s nothing bothering the kids right now. There’s a pervasive feel that there are spirits of murdered children and their parents who’d gone to the school before, not the ones that are here now. They are causing mischief. There’s another entity and something needs to happen. So I’m sitting in this rocking chair and the cats are coming. One of the cats has fur that looks like it’s been crocheted. Another one comes and its fur looks like it’s been knitted. They’re all super soft and they act like regular cats, but every once in a while they stop and talk to me and tell me what’s going on. There’s a black cat that comes and a white cat that comes. This whole time the kitchen scene is happening and the kids are eating. I don’t know who’s feeding them but there’s somebody feeding them and clearing the table and bringing food. I’ve got an ear and eye on that. But the cats keep going in and out of being just cats and then talking to me. I cannot remember what they’re telling me. They’re warning me and trying to give me the backstory of what happened in this place so long ago that’s still there that needs to be cleared. The dream progresses. I’m looking at a painting. I’m with Oscar, a healer and medicine man I know from instagram. We’re looking at this painting. I don’t remember what the painting is, I think just a woman. He says, “Look deeper at this painting.” It’s like one of those magic-eye posters where if you stare long enough at it a picture emerges out of it. I’m looking at a ship on the ocean and clouds but as I’m staring at it, a picture of a woman emerges. She looks like Mother Mary with a cloth over her head and there’s something over her throat. She’s looking straight at me and is holding a hand up. Oscar says, “You have to look and see this. It’s really important that you know that everything in the world is like this. Whatever you’re seeing, there’s something else also that will be revealed.” I’m tripping out because it is showing up underneath the painting. With the painting I see in the first place, it’s really hard to imagine there would be anything underneath it and yet there is. My brain is like, “How am I seeing this?” It’s freaking me out. The dream shifts and I’m hanging out with my friends from high school - Brianna, Nani, Janet, Teresa, and Connie. We’re older now. They’re talking about what it was like to hang out when we were in middle school. They’re talking about the trips they used to go on. They would leave the islands and go places with each other. I’m totally surprised and am like, “When did you do that? When did you all go places? How come I wasn’t invited?” We were all hanging out together and going to school on the same schedule. I’m not asking from a place of hurt, I’m just super curious because they did all these things but didn’t invite me. I ask if there was a reason for that. I don’t think they answer my question. I do note in myself that I’m not hurt or upset about them doing stuff without me. I’m truly curious but not concerned.

I took one of the ropes and was doing a knot over, under, over, under, or over and I asked the people if I was getting it right and I pulled a ship on the shore. Mine was the last of three ropes. Then for some reason I was crammed in with a bunch of people somewhere and we were part of a retreat I think. It was like I was in a dressing room with red velvet and gold curtains. There were three other people I don’t know. This young guy was really upset and talking about “I have a kid, I just graduated Pasadena, I work at a grocery store” and he was saying this wife and kids are who he lives with (and he looked really young) and he said his kids just graduated from high school but they were 29 and I was so confused.

We’re going to a park where we can camp and there’s also a house and cabins you can rent. We’re celebrating something. It’s very chill. There’s a pond with a slide and a diving platform that are facing each other so there’s literally no room between the slide and the diving platform, so if you were to ride down the slide, you’d end up on the diving platform, or if you wanted to dive off the diving platform, you’d dive right onto the slide. It’s very bizarre and in the very center of the pond which is not even big enough for swimming. There are trees and it’s like a forest. There’s also an open area. We’re there celebrating and I’m actually starting to get concerned because I’m seeing that tons of people are showing up and it’s turning into a crazy mob, like a huge party of college kids. In my mind I'm going, “Uh, coronavirus is up and we’re all going to get coronavirus now, great. This is not okay.” When all the people show up, the pond gets bigger. I’m wading into the water. I’m wearing this one-piece swimsuit and it’s got an eighties vibe because the legs are super high cut and I have a crazy cameltoe going and it’s a shiny burnt orange color. I don’t wear one-piece swimsuits, only when I was on the swim team. My hair is down and I’m standing at the edge of the water pulling some playboy moves. People are watching and I’m getting uncomfortable because I’m there for myself. I came to this thing because it was going to be a small intimate gathering, but now there’s tons of people. There are shenanigans happening everywhere - bottles being broken on the grass, people rocking in their camper vans, loud music playing, people partying at the back of their trucks. It’s crazy. I keep focusing on the slide and diving platform because I want to go down the slide, but it’s too close to the diving platform. Eventually I go in the water and then come out. The water is pretty warm but when I come out, it’s cold, like about to start snowing cold. I bundle myself up and head back to the house that we rented. Now there are way more people in it. I’m crawling into a bed because I’m freezing. I’m first there by myself, but then all these other people show up and they crawl into the bed with me. The other people are older, like aunties and uncles and even grandmas. I’m like, “Nope.” The sun has gone down. I change clothes so I’m warm and I go out of the house. There’s this guy, I don’t know him, maybe in his thirties with short dark hair. I noticed him by the pond earlier because he was there doing some work and he had this bronze statue of himself that was animated. He had made a copy of himself that was helping him with a project down there. When I come out of the house, he’s by the house with his bronze copy of himself. But the copy is misbehaving, it won’t do what he tells it to do. He’s trying to kill it and chop off its head in pieces. I’m a little freaked out by the whole thing because I get this eerie feeling that if he doesn’t do something about that copy of himself it’s going to wreak havoc on everybody and just start killing everyone. At some point, he manages to get control of it and chops it into pieces and puts it on a tarp and wraps the tarp up. I’m kind of grossed out by the whole thing. I don’t know what he does with the tarp. He’s definitely a musician because i see him go from there to setting up a ritual space. He brings all the elements in. He has rings on his fingers. I’m wondering what he’s doing and what he’s setting up. The dream shifts. I end up traveling somewhere else. I’m traveling with Josh. he’s feeling super beat down and his self esteem is in the toilet. He’s picking at acne on his body so badly that it’s leaving holes in his skin. He’s super fucking depressed. I don’t know where we’re traveling to or from. I don’t even know what kind of vehicle we’re in but there are seats. I’m in a seat and he’s in a seat next to me. There’s seaglass, round and smooth, and some are pretty big like the size of the palm of my hand. They’re all different colors, red and purple and greens and blues. There are smaller pieces, too. It’s gorgeous and it’s his personal collection. I’m trying to hang onto this glass while we’re in this vehicle. At some point we’re flying because I look out the window and see clouds below us, but we’re also driving. I put the glass down and all of a sudden the vehicle accelerates and the glass falls off the shelf I put it on and shatters into so many tiny pieces on the metal of the floor of this vehicle. Josh is ambivalent about it and I’m like, “Oh my god, all of your glass!” I’m horrified because I put it there and it broke, but he’s like, “I don’t really care.” I’m super upset about it breaking and I feel bad. I’m also upset that he doesn’t care. I sweep up all the little shards and we put them in the trash. There are a few tiny pieces left and I gather those up and hang onto them. We get to where we’re going and we get out of this vehicle. We end up at a weird saloon bar place. It’s dark. We meet these two women who I think were our travel companions at one point. I don’t know who they are but they’re familiar to me in the dream. One of the women has a blond braid and the other has longer dark hair. They sit down at a table and ask the bartender for this type of alcohol that you usually need one shot of and you’re good. They’re like, “We’ll take the whole bottle.” The bartender is like, “No you won’t.” And they’re like, “Yeah, we will.” Josh is like, “Yeah, let them have it. I’ll take care of them.” I’m looking at him like, “No! They’re going to be obnoxious and terrible.” But by the time I look back, the two women have finished the bottle and the bartender is standing there with shoulders shrugged. I’m like, “Oh no.” Of course they get crazy. Josh starts feeding off of them energetically because he doesn’t drink at all. I’m looking at him like, “Uh oh, this is not going to be good, you’re going from depressed to manic.” They’re playing on a piano. It is like a saloon. There’s nobody else in there. The bartender is like, “And we’re closing.” I’m like, “What do you mean, you’re closing? You just got these two ladies wasted and there’s no place for us to go. We’re staying here.” The dream shifts. I’m not exactly sure where I’m at, maybe a Costco type area. There’s a guy, older man maybe in his fifties, pot-bellied white dude with short hair. He’s used his body his whole life to work, you can tell, his hands are super callused. He’s hungry and he’s trying to figure out what to eat that is healthy. I’m standing looking at everything in the freezer section and am like, “Okay, if you eat this, this and this, it doesn’t have any dairy.” I was trying to find food that met the restrictions he had. I say, “This pizza has a cauliflower crust and it’s non-dairy with fake cheese. It comes with these other items in the box, so you can buy the whole thing and that’s your meal.” There’s a microwave conveniently nearby. He heats it up and eats while we’re standing in the freezer section. He puts the tray down on his shopping cart, eats and enjoys it. The whole time he’s complaining about how expensive it is for him to eat this way even though he needs to because it’s becoming life or death. He needs to start eating in a more healthy way. I’m telling him, “You can complain about the money it costs to buy this food or you can complain about the money it costs for all the healthcare you’re going to need. There are ways to cut down because you can buy food at the beginning of the week and meal prep and that saves money. You have containers in the fridge you can eat.” I’m going through all this stuff I know from my nutrition degree to help him out and simplify things for him. But I don’t know who he is and I don’t know why I’m doing this for him. I don’t know if I’m getting paid for it or not. It seems like a lot of energy being put into this person who keeps saying over and over again, “This is really expensive.” Eventually I’m like, “Do you feel better?” He says yes. I’m like, “Okay, so it’s your choice. You can keep eating shit and keep feeling like shit or you can figure out how to do this. He doesn’t give me a response and I just wake up.",Rose,last_nights_dream

A friend offered to take me to his church. It was an hour away but I agreed just the once. It was good and after the service I stuck around to help clean up. I stacked some chairs but was called away to help move a set of heavy speakers. It was Samantha and Angelina who needed them in another room. They instructed me to hold the speakers carefully and at a low center of gravity. If I fell I was to use my body to protect the speakers. I picked one up and it wasn't as heavy as they had made it out. I walked between the two of them across the room through a doorway and to some stairs. The staircase was impossible and made no geometric sense. I almost walked off the edge to where the staircase was half a story below. I managed to get down the stairs but then had to go up a few steps to make a 180 turn to go back down. In the room, I asked if they were practicing music. They said no, that they were going to have a private discussion and wanted to play music.  I finished setting up the speakers and with some difficulty got everything plugged in and working.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

It’s sunning itself and they’re usually a bit preoccupied when they’re doing that so I’m not alarmed and I’m just watching it. It’s a big snake, it looks like a boa but it’s not six feet long, it’s [probably about four feet long. Maybe it’s a baby boa. It’s about three inches thick through the middle. It has a really attractive assortment of markings, pretty intricate with a lot of colors. That’s why I’m just standing there looking at it, I’m admiring it. All of a sudden it springs, it recoils, and it shoots itself maybe three or two feet away from me. It does this so quickly that I scream. As I’m screaming I see that it saw a rat and it just shot itself over to the rat. But I screamed so loud that I actually woke myself up.

1864,1498,,11/12/2020,12/11/2020 00:03,"“Snakes” I’m now in a place outside with snakes. Now I’m a little bit nervous in my dream. There are different colors and sizes of them and they’re all on the ground where I am. I’m trying to tippy toe around them. I’m not in the same place I was in the first dream. This place has a tropical lush feel. I’m trying to pick my way through the snakes. I’m scared and really want to run but I’m afraid quick movements will disturb the snakes. So I’m walking very slowly and carefully, tip-toeing. I make it through the forest without being attacked by snakes. I come out in someone’s backyard or a recreational area with an in-ground pool. I see some people I know - the Jones family. I know the mom and one of her sons. The mom sees me and waves me over. I go and sit with her as she indicates - in front of her. We’re sitting in outdoor lawn furniture and there’s an umbrella over our heads. She’s talking because this is her family reunion. She’s describing the relationships she has with everyone. She’s animated and enjoying this conversation. I certainly don’t mind listening to her describe her connections and her joy with her family. Then she asks me if I want to swim. I happen to be wearing a bathing suit underneath my dress and tell her, “Yeah, that would be great.” I get in the pool. I’m swimming around, just enjoying the water. There are a lot of other people in the pool. At one point I lean back against the edge of the pool and put my elbows on it and lean my head back a little, letting the rest of my body float up near the surface. I’m just lightly moving my feet to keep my lower body afloat. My mind kind of drifts away. I’m aware of other people there but I’m just enjoying the sun. There’s an intense blue sky above me. I’m in the water and it’s just nice. But then the laughing gets closer and becomes more sporadic so it disturbs my reverie. I open my eyes and let my feet float down towards the bottom of the pool. I notice that one guy is standing at the edge of the pool and he’s doubled over and holding his stomach because he’s laughing so hard. He’s barely wearing any bathing suit. It’s like the guys are wearing thongs. I realize from listening to the conversation that they’ve had a competition, I guess it’s an annual thing at the family reunion of who has the skimpiest bathing suit. It’s just the men doing this. I notice that I’m surrounded by the generation of men who are having this competition. I wish that I’d known that before I got in the pool and was lying there. I would have stayed out of it because I feel out of place here. The reason they are laughing so hard is because the guy standing beside me only has a small amount of bathing suit and it’s just over his dick, like a half applied condom. They’re laughing because he wins this year and no one thought of doing that. It’s a bathing suit because it’s technically made of bathing suit material. I can’t remember how I get out of the pool, but suddenly I am. I wrap my towel around my body and make my way back over to where the mom is sitting. Then, I turn around in my chair and see some of these snakes around the edge of the pool. When I look at the snakes and then back at the scene in front of me it’s not the Jones family reunion, it’s the Weber family reunion. The two matriarchs do not get along, but I think they did at one point. Now I’m talking to Mrs. Weber and I see the oldest Jones son standing there in her reunion. He doesn’t see me. I saw his face for a moment and then he turns around and walks towards the pool where the men are gathered. I think this isn’t good because that Jones son used to be married to the Weber daughter and Mrs. Jones is not going to be happy to discover that the son is actually a member of the other family as well. Then the dream shifts again. I’m sitting in front of the Jones matriarch talking to her. I ask her if she was aware that the Jones son is also a member of the other family, the one she doesn’t want him to associate with. She questions me and says, “How do you know that?” I tell her. Then I say, “And I think it’s true because if you stop for a moment and trace the lineage, you can see where the two families were once one family.” She says, “Oh no, you’re right. They are.” She gets really thoughtful and stops talking.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream2

1871,1499,,14/12/2020,12/14/2020 00:01,"“The Stairs” I’m in kind of like an office building, that’s what it feels like. Everything is that institutional color, white or grey. There are a lot of windows but no design or creativity to the architecture, it’s just put together. The dream begins on the bottom floor. There is one couch and a whole bunch of boxes of clothes. I’ve brought one of them here with my daughter’s clothes from where she was four and five. I brought them because her godparents at the time, their daughter is three and most of the clothes have only been worn a couple of times so they look brand new, including this pair of white girls shoes that you put on for special occasions. She only had them on for one two-hour thing, it was a funeral, and I carried her for most of it. The godparents are looking through their daughter’s own clothes trying to find a pair of shoes. I tell them that there’s a pair that I brought in the box of clothes. The godmother says nothing and continues to look through the boxes of clothes as though I haven’t spoken. Her husband says, “Oh thanks, that would be great! Where is the box that you brought?” I tell him, “I put it over there.” He goes that way and starts looking for it. In the meantime, I’m sitting on the couch with their daughter. She normally doesn’t laugh and I know this. She doesn’t express her emotions very well. I’m very careful not to pick her up and toss her around the way some adults do with the kids or disrespect her space. I just sit on the couch and if she wants to come over, she will. I look at her and talk to her. I notice that she has a really old face for a three year old. I find this compelling. I’m really paying attention because I think she has some wisdom that has perhaps been overlooked due to the fact that she’s in a three year old body. She eventually toddles over and sits on my lap. She’s facing me and she grabs my hands. You know how kids run up your body and then they somersault while they’re holding your hands? She does that. I’m a little surprised because I know she’s reputed to be standoffish; however, I’m quite familiar with this move so we do it. After the second one she starts to laugh and her parents look at me with some surprise. The mom looks annoyed and comes over and tries to grab her, but she says no to her mom and does the somersaults a few more times and is laughing. By this time, I’m uncomfortable. I ask the child if it’s okay if I set her down on the couch. She says she doesn’t want me to do that. I say, “Okay, how ‘bout we stand up and help look in the boxes?” She agrees to do this but wants to be carried. I shift her so she’s balanced on my left hip. We walk towards her dad who finds the shoes at that moment. He says, “Okay, let’s get you dressed.” I give her to her dad. Now I’m on some kind of rescue mission and am supposed to go up to the top floor of the building. I walk over to the stairwell. It’s like if you look at stairs from the side of the building and you can see that there’s a forty-five degree angle going up and then another one going up, and you can see all these angles, but you can also see the ones going down as if you’re right beside it and seeing through the glass. They look like this when I’m trying to go up them. The down-going stairs are mixed in with the up-going stairs. The first time, it’s quite clear to me and I can see the up-going stairs anyway. I go to the top floor where I’m supposed to be. There’s a woman and I have an appointment with her. I make it for the appointment. She talks to me but I don’t remember what we say to each other. She gives me some kind of assignment that I’m responsible for. I take it. I’m not sure if it’s something physical; it’s something in my mind. I accept it. I go back down the stairs. I realize that I have a question that I’m uncertain about. As soon as I get to the bottom I want to go back up the stairs. I do one flight and then the down-going stairs exerts itself in front of me. I go down one flight anyway because I have to in order to access the up-going stairs. But the access for the up-going stairs isn’t there, so I go down one more flight thinking I’ll find it but I don’t. Now I’m feeling concerned because I’ve gone down two flights of stairs and I don’t want to be down here. I see the door open and it’s really dark where that person has come from - it’s like an underground parking lot with that creepy kind of feel to it. I think if I watch what they’re doing then I can find the up-going stairs. But they’re running really quickly. I can hear their footsteps going up but I can’t see what path they’ve taken. I follow the up-going stairs anyway. It takes me back up the two flights that I mistakenly descended. Then I’m trying to continue going up back to the offices but the down-going stairs keeps mixing up. This time I’m smarter and I don’t take the down-going flights, I just keep trying to find the up-going ones. After a little while I realize I can’t and think I’ll have to go on the mission anyway with these questions in my mind.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I’m socializing with and having conversations with the people that I didn't know before I got there amongst what feels like to be an atmosphere of companionship and camaraderie. All of us leave the log cabin and go downtown to have something to eat. It looks like an old-fashioned ice cream parlor with those milkshake machines that are slim and have the metal cups. I scoop the ice cream into the metal cup and pour the milk in, then insert the cup onto the whisk. The cup stays there while the machine shakes the milk with the whisk then you have this cool frosty iced milkshake. While we’re in there, one of the guys and his friend begin talking to me. I feel an attraction to the guy that’s talking to me. I know he feels it, too. He reacts as though he does but he tells me that he has to leave in the morning, so he’s trying to fix me up with his friend who I do not feel any chemistry with. I’m telling him, “No, I’m not interested in your friend.” He’s trying to convince me and saying, “But my friend is a really nice guy and he’s single.” I’m saying, “Be that as it may, I feel nothing more than friends with him, so no.” The guy I’m talking to relents. We continue flirting, standing close with a little body contact. I do realize he’s leaving in the morning. We go back to the cabin. I’m really sleepy. It’s like 3:30 in the morning. A couple of my friends are going into the shadowy part of the cabin and I know that’s where their bed is. They just go to sleep. That’s what I’m trying to do. I go around the L-shape of the cabin to a bed that’s kind of tucked in the wall, it’s part of the design of the cabin. I lie down in one of the beds and close my eyes and go to sleep. But the guy I was flirting with, his friend, and another guy I can’t see because he’s in the stem of the L, and somebody who wasn’t there before and just arrived. I’m vaguely aware of this but I’m too tired to get up and I don’t really care and it’s 3:30. They’re all talking to each other and I can hear the low rumbling of their voices. I sleep again. Then when I wake up, I wake up to the sound of male voices and they’re chanting. The name they’re chanting is Joe. It’s like, “Joe, Joe, Joe Joe,” like a pub crawl bar room to get somebody to chug their beer. They’re saying it quietly, but it’s the feel of the chant and it’s woken me up. In that instant where I’m wondering what they’re doing I realize what they’re doing. Then I realize that I heard the guy I felt the energy with say in his subconscious: “Maybe Paige would like it.” I’m thinking, “Where did that girl come from?” Then I remember there was a younger girl in the cabin before I fell asleep. She was about 13 or 14. I’m thinking her name must be Paige. Out of the corner of my eye I realize that the other guy who also entered at about 3:30 has no pants on. Then my brain puts it together. I’m thinking, “Maybe Paige would like it?” And they’re chanting his name. He’s doing something to her! I get up out of the bed and I see him.

I just know I’m with other people and we’re all looking at houses together. There’s one property with three houses on it. All the houses are painted white and the insides are painted white. They kind of look like plantation homes that you’d see on Hawaii where the sugar and pineapple plantations are. They’re really open floor plans, a single wood wall, big windows, wood floors and interesting layouts. The grounds in between each house are pretty well manicured with short palms and hapu’u ferns so I must be in Hawaii. I’m looking and we decide not to buy it because it’s too much. Then I come back to this house later in the dream and later in my life. I think I'm with someone but I’m not sure. The house has been bought by friends. I come and look at the different houses. They’ve remodeled a bit and the houses aren’t white anymore. They’ve got red accents on the insides. Whoever I’m with, I’m not comfortable with them. I’m also here to see the daughter of the family that owns these homes now. I’m not sure who it is; it’s a female person and we’re not really friends.

1877,1501,,16/12/2020,12/16/2020 00:02,"“The Colourful Night” I’m with my first boyfriend. It feels like we’re in Mexico. There’s a beach and an ocean. It’s nighttime but there are so many colors of lights and festivities of people gathered together. The sounds of music and lights are all off in the distance. I’ve been to Mexico and it feels like that colorful joyous culture. We’re walking along the beach at night. He’s telling me that he’s only here for a little while. I feel a bit sad about that. I want him to stay longer. As we walk a little farther on, it’s really pretty. It’s a white sand beach and there’s a moon. You can tell the color of the sand because the moonlight is bright. We approach a path leading down to the beach from somewhere else, and I can see it in the darkness. We turn up it and start to move away from the beach. There’s a night market with crafts and people who have made crafts and set up a makeshift vendor tent out of a few simple poles and some canvas or fabric. There are a lot of these makeshift tables. There’s a camaraderie kind of atmosphere as we walk through. They’re background noise though because we’re in conversation with each other and we’re walking through the market, we’re not stopping at the vendors or looking at their crafts or what they have to offer. We come to another path. We turn up it, away from the vendor market. It’s like beach apartments, flat, one level and very simple, obviously places where people sleep because the sound from the market and ocean is reduced here. I suddenly realize that I don’t know where we’re sleeping - I don’t know where he’s sleeping or where I’m sleeping. I’m getting tired and want to lie down and rest. He says we can sleep here for the night and indicates a door on his right. He says it belongs to his brother. So we open the door and right inside the door is a bed. We lie down on the bed and I close my eyes for a few minutes. I wake up and feel like it’s not that much longer but he’s behind me and his arm is around me. It feels soothing even though I’m awake and listening to the sounds around me. In a little while, he wakes up. We both sit on the bed and have a conversation where I tell him that I want him to stay longer. He says he can but there are a few conditions. He wants to be able to work on his art and he wants his own space. There was something else he wanted, but I can't remember. I think, “Okay, these are easy to fulfill and he already does that anyway.” Without any second guessing or additional contemplation, I agree. He seems really happy about this and so am I. We leave the apartment and walk back through the marketplace. We go a little farther and there are some raw materials like clay and wood. He’s poking through those looking for something he can use. I’m doing the same thing but not with the same materials. Some other people start to infiltrate the environment where we’re doing this right now. They’re talking to me and asking me what I want to use these materials for. They’re asking what he wants to use these for, too. There’s the feeling that they are causing a disconnect between us. I don’t want to answer all these questions. It doesn't matter to me what they think. I just want to collect my materials and see if he’s ready to go.

1880,1502,,17/12/2020,12/17/2020 00:02,"“The Scar” I’m at Omar’s house. There’s a little skinny tiny stairway that goes down into the crawlspace which is the basement. It’s the kind of stairs that you pull up and hook so it forms a floor. When you want to go into the crawlspace, you unhook them, lower the stairs and then you can climb down. The washing machine and dryer are down there. I need to change my clothes because they’re wet. I’ve got a spare pair of jeans that are Omar’s. I’m holding them over my arm as I climb down these stairs. You have to hunch over to make yourself shorter in order to go through the crawlspace, but once you get over to the washing machine and dryer, you can stand up. I’ve done this and I’m there. I’ve taken off my own wet clothes and put them in the dryer. I’ve forgotten to be careful as I’m putting on the dry jeans. I hear a sound and stand up really quickly and turn around. There’s a light bulb screwed into the ceiling and my face meets it as I’m turning around. Because I’ve started and done it with such force, the light bulb breaks and it cuts my face and now it’s bleeding. I turn around and Omar is standing there. He says, “You’re bleeding. What happened?” He comes over and finds the cut which is on my nose. He tells me to sit down so he can pinch the two sides of skin together to stop the bleeding. He’s talking to me as he’s holding it. I still feel traumatized. I’m just listening to him. The sound of his voice is calming me down. I go to stand up because I want to clean my face and arms. He says, “Wait, it’s not ready.” I try to stand up anyway and of course it wasn’t ready and the skin breaks apart and the bleeding starts. This time when he puts my head back in his arms and squeezes the skin together, I decide I’ll just listen to him. Eventually he says, “There, I think that will hold now. It’s okay, you can get up.” I get up, climb back up the stairs and go to the sink in the kitchen and start to wash the blood off my arms. Blood is all over my wrists, my forearms, my hands. It’s crusted on a bit and I feel sticky. I want to change out of all of my clothes but I don’t have anything else there I can wear. I want to wash my face but am afraid the cut will open again. Now he’s climbed back up the stairs, too, and drawn them up and hooked them onto the surface of the floor. He comes over to the sink and starts taking some of the water from the tap in his hands and is trying to clean my hair. Someone else comes in at that point. I think it’s his ex-wife, it’s some woman I can’t picture. She starts questioning what’s happened. I just let him do the talking because I’m still trying to scrub myself off of the blood. Now it’s got a weird energy to it. I feel like I’ve done something I’m not supposed to have done. I think about going home.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

As we approached the water we could tell that it was going to be a high tide. There was something other worldly about this place. The tide coming in as high as it was, was an unusual event that we recognized as significant.  We saw the water lapping against the roots of the trees. I worried the forest would be destroyed. We decided to climb the cliff to get to higher ground. It was difficult and I worried that I would be swept away but I made it.   At the top there was a stone tomb.

I’m with my dad and we’re planning to go to Niagara Falls and spend the day at the amusement park. There are some other kids going, too, and I think they’re just friends of mine. I’m teenage me. I’m talking with my dad about what rides we’re going to go on. We discuss the fact that it’s cold and we’re going to need to wear extra clothes. So there are some conversations about what we’re going to bring because we don’t want to carry too much but we want the right things for the weather. I’m excited about going. My ex-best friend who I was still friends with when I was a teenager, calls on the phone and I tell her that we’re going. She says she’s going to meet us there because she’ll be in the area. She asks me what time we’ll arrive. I tell her we haven’t finished figuring that out yet and I’ll call her back when my dad lets me know. I hang up the phone and it suddenly dawns on me that the reason the amusement park is still open right now and not crowded is one of the reasons we decided to go. It’s not normally open this time of the year when it’s cold and near Christmas. We also wouldn’t go to an amusement park because it’s so crowded and the lineups are too long. I realize that these criteria are in existence because of COVID. It sinks in that we also should not be going. We can't bring all these people together, we can’t circulate through the park. I feel this moment of rebelliousness where I want to go anyway at the same time I know we can’t and we won’t. I voice this to my dad. He doesn’t say anything. He silently realizes the truth of this, too. I pick up the phone and call my friend back and tell her we won’t be going after all. She asks me what I’m going to do. I tell her I’m going to be home but we realized that the reason the amusement park is open later in the year and there’s hardly anyone there is because of COVID so we can’t go.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream1
1890,1504,,19/12/2020,12/19/2020 00:03,"“My Grandmother’s Shoes” I’m in the same bungalow as the first dream only the characters are different. I’m at the dining room table. There’s a crate beside me, made of plexiglass. There are a whole bunch of different pairs of shoes in it and it’s just sitting there. I glance at it, note that there are many pairs of shoes in it, then return my attention to the table. There are wooden bowls full of things, one has acorns in it and another has bits of yarn, some have other things. It’s an odd assortment of stuff that could possibly just be junk. It looks like things people would put in a daycare on a kids craft shelf so they can glue them on paper, like bits of macaroni, buttons and things like that. I’m sorting them out. I see my cousin and her husband come in. I see my other cousin and her husband, too, and another cousin, only she looks different and I can’t tell if it’s her or someone else. Maybe it’s her with someone else’s face but she’s not alive anymore. Here she is and she’s acting like Nancy but she doesn’t look like her. We’re deciding to go on a hike. The cousins are very animated and start taking the conversation into stories of things they’ve done themselves. I realize the decision is not going to be made anytime soon. I turn back around to the sorting of things in these little wooden bowls. I go into the next room for a moment and my grandmother is there, my dad’s mom. She tells me that I should try on the shoes from the crate. I tell her that they look really uncomfortable and are not shoes for hiking. She says, “No, no, go get them. Just try them on. See if they fit.” I pick the crate up and bring it into the room where she’s sitting. I start to unwrap the shoes - they’re in tissue paper. The first ones, I show her the soles. The heels are really high, the sole on the ball of the foot is quite tiny, like a triangle, and the spike at the end of the heel is made of something that curls rather than just a flat piece. I say, “These don’t look very comfortable!” She says, “You might be surprised. Try them on anyway.” So I do. I set the shoe down on the ground and I stand up. I start to slide my foot into it. I realize the whole shoe is made of plexiglass and my foot slides around in it. It’s too small and it’s bending my foot in an uncomfortable angle. I say, “Well these don’t fit.” I put it back in the crate. She says, “Try another pair.” I take another pair out of the box. The boxes are made of clear plexiglass and they’re all in this plexiglass crate. The shoes themselves are wrapped in tissue paper. I unwrap another pair and they’re made of candy apple red color and a bright canary yellow plexiglass. Again, there’s a curl to them, like someone has taken the plexiglass and shaped a shoe from it. The bottoms aren’t completely flat, they’re just the edges of the curves. Again, I stick my foot in. I feel how slippery the plexiglass feels and it’s also too small for my foot. I try one more pair on, but I say, “Grandma, I’m pretty sure these are all the same size and none of them are going to fit me.” They used to fit me because they used to be my shoes. I tell her, “Isn’t it strange that my feet have grown a little bit? I don’t think they’re a seven anymore. I believe I’m now an eight. But isn’t it strange because I thought your feet stayed the same size throughout your life?” She doesn’t say anything, but she says, “Hmm.” She watches me put on another pair and again they feel too tight, too small, and I can’t spread my toes out in them. I wrap them back up, put them back in their little box and put them back in the crate. She says, “Wait here one moment.” She leaves and comes back with a box. She says, “Try these ones on.” She takes them out of the box and hands me both shoes. I look at them and hope they fit because they look really comfortable and I think I could hike in them even though they have an open toe, they’re flat and they don’t look like hiking shoes. But in the dream, I think they would be good for this journey. I put them on and they fit perfectly and they’re comfortable. She says, “You can have them.” She tells me my feet were meant to fit in those. I give her a hug and say thank you. I go back into the room where my cousins are and say, “Are you guys ready to go yet?” They’re still laughing and talking with each other. One of them notices my shoes and says, “Oh, you’re wearing Grandma’s shoes.” I tell her, “Yes, she gave them to me.” She says, “I wonder why Grandma gave her shoes to you.” I don’t answer. I don’t think that’s something I can explain to them. So I'm waiting for them to get ready to leave, but in the dream, we never do.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream2

He was only slightly so. We continued and the captain left. We weren't sure where we were going and as the river took a bend, it simply ended. We were at the end of the river which turned into a path through a sparse forest in the midst of more open grasslands. We got out and began dragging the boat along the path assuming there would be more water on the other side. But we weren't sure where we were and worried about damaging the boat so we returned it to the river and made our way back.  The captain asked us where we had been and we explained the situation.

There were workers not wearing masks in the hallway and I yelled at them. They were putting a clear outer door over all the unit doors. It was a hallway that looked familiar but not mine (like the apartment). Pinto and I went to go see dog friends, Chuck and Trevor, and somehow Chuck was a small dog maybe a wiener mix.

One room is a barber shop, another is a restaurant, and there are other rooms and businesses, but these are the main ones I’m aware of. Our plan is to keep the restaurant going and revive it, then maybe turn the other rooms into living quarters for all of us. I don’t know who this collective is, though. Just after we close the deal a broker comes in and he’s upset because we signed the papers so quickly and overlooked some important limitations around the building and modifications. He points at the barber shop and says, “See these chairs? They are historically protected chairs so you won’t be able to change them.” We’re a little downhearted and then think maybe there’s a way to work with the chairs and fit them into the redesign, so we’re not too upset. Then the dream continues but shifts. I see a map and then am driving on one of the roads on the map near the building. I’m helping a woman buy a trailer to escape her crazy ex-husband. We find a place in a little neighborhood in the woods. It seems protected, isolated and hidden enough that he won’t find her. There are a series of winding roads, checkpoints and trees. The trees look like guardians. I can see in the bark of one tree, the design of a woman. We start to move her in. Across the dirt road is a sculpture - a bust of a white woman with big red lips and yellow blond hair. She looks out of place.

1898,1272,,20/12/2020,12/20/2020 00:05,"This dream is all over the place. I’m with some people, I’m not sure who. I’m showing them how to get over a barrier that looks a lot like the plastic plexiglass barriers that we have up now because of coronavirus, between cashiers and people. The barriers are really tall and kind of remind me of a hockey rink. The panels are skinny and narrow though, attached to a solid unbroken bottom foundation. The plexiglass panels bend a lot because I can pull them down almost in half and climb up over them. We climb over them. I don’t know where we’re going, I’m just showing them how to do this. We come to this lake and I’m having a psychic energy session with a psychic, but I don’t know who she is. It’s actually not just her, it’s a whole council of beings so I’m wondering if this is my own council. I know they do some energetic work, but I have one last question for them. I’m like, “Hey I haven’t bled in a while. What’s going on with that?” I’m thinking it’s menopause or something. The guide, a woman with short blond hair, says, “Oh let me look.” She looks and says, “That’s because you’re pregnant, kitten.” She calls me kitten! I’m like, “Oh god, nope. This isn’t good.” I’m not excited about this. I don’t see the other guides in front of me, they’re kind of like a voice in my head because I’m now back at this lake. It’s dark around me and the water is dark. I’m standing on an island. The people I’m with are constantly shifting and changing. I don’t see who they are and don’t recognize any of them. There’s a guy who looks a little like a Star Wars character, the guy who plays Hans Solo and Leia’s son. He is throwing things into the water. I see him pick up a baby by a foot and just wing it into the lake. I’m like, “Is that your child?” He’s like, “Yeah, but I don’t want it and I don’t need it.” I’m like, “If you do that, it’s going to die.” He’s like, “Yup.” I’m shocked and I watch the baby land in the water and never come back up again. I’m horrified. None of the other people say anything. I switch out of this part of the dream. Now I’m on a ship like a huge houseboat that kind of remind me of those big ships that go down the Mississippi with the big wheels in the back that push the water around. They were used in the early days of our country. But it’s rickety and looks like it’s an old house that is falling apart. It’s made of wood and doesn’t have an opening on the top for a sail. It’s enclosed like a house. There are a lot of us on it, but I don’t know anyone. The waves are crazy big and choppy. I notice the boat has a good engine because it’s going really fast. I don’t know who the boat captain is but I think this boat captain obviously knows what he’s doing because he’s keeping speed and he’s going up into the waves so we don’t get swamped. Part of me is like, “Oh my god, what are we doing?” and the other part of me has total trust. So there’s part of me that’s a bit panicked because the waves are huge and also I have no idea why I’m on this boat in the ocean or who I’m with. The other part of me is totally trusting because this boat captain has clearly got it and I’m not too worried. I’m watching as we go out into the waves out into open ocean. I can also see off of one side of the boat, houses on a shore that are also all rickety. We pass by junkyards. The land is torn up quite a bit. You can see jetties where they’ve built up the walls with big huge rocks to stop the surf. I also see broken down cars and broken down trucks that are old and rusty. The yards have buoys in them. Everything is very rundown and not taken care of. I don’t see any people out there. I also don’t see many people on the boat with me, I just know they’re there. We go out and then turn around and come back on this boat. I don’t know where we’re going or where we’ve come back to, but there’s purpose and again it’s me just trusting that the boat captain knows what they’re doing. Now I’m talking to this guy who looks a little like my next door neighbor. He’s like, “Oh I’m heading to the gym. You need to come to the gym with me. We need to get off this boat with me and go.” He’s kind of flirting with me and I’m not exactly sure what his intentions are or why I need to go with him. I’m like, “Okay, I’m not doing anything else and I actually really want to get off, so let’s go to this gym.” Suddenly we’re there and it’s more like a fitness spa with a lot of amenities. We’re walking down the hall towards the weight room. I see this family of a mom and three kids, I don’t see the dad, I hear someone in my head say, “Oh they’re half Japanese, half white.” I’m like, “Okay.” They show up and the mom is trying to herd the two girls and boy. It looks like they’ve been in a pool and now she’s trying to get them home and out of this fitness center. The two little girls and especially one of them, are taken with me and want to be with me. The one girl wants my towel. I give it to her. Their hair is all wet. She’s talking with me and I’m entertaining and indulging her. The mom says, “Okay, sweetie, it’s time to go.” She takes the kids and they disappear. The guy and I get back to our conversation. We were talking about something important, it was an ongoing conversation that started on the boat. We resume this conversation. The mom comes back with the towel. The towel is super thin and ratty, not very big, the size of a child’s towel, and I feel like it has Snoopy printed on it somewhere. It’s damp and she has it all wadded up. She hands it back to me and is like, “I see that my daughter took this from you. I’m so sorry, here you go.” I’m like, “Don’t worry about it. I gave it to her. Not a big deal. Thank you for bringing it back to me.” Then she disappears. That’s all I can remember from the dream.",Rose,last_nights_dream
1899,1505,,20/12/2020,12/20/2020 00:06,"“No-ga” (instead of “yoga”) The dream starts and I’m in a room with a cork floor and boxes piled up along the sides of the walls. It’s a weird shape, not a square, not a rectangle. It has three sides as though it’s trying to make itself into a square because it’s really big but they aren’t even a triangle. I’m thinking, “What is this room? What am I doing here?” I’m trying to formulate a context in my mind for what the room is. I close my eyes for a moment then I open them again. Now the room is a square and it’s arranged itself. There are panels. The boxes are gone but the cork floor is there. I’m thinking, “Am I in a hot yoga room?” There’s still one wall that’s open but there’s a hallway that leads out to it. Then a woman comes in. she’s wearing a fake wool sweater, one of those thready ones, and baggy corduroy pants and hard-soled shoes that lace up. I notice that she has really unproportionately small feet for the size of her body. Her hair is kind of dirty. She tells people to roll their mats out and get in rows. I am in a hot yoga room. I see that there are about twenty people, all dressed for hot yoga class. Suddenly I have a mat and it’s rolled out and I’m sitting on my mat. She walks across the floor and now it’s that spongy gym kind of floor. I notice she still hasn’t taken her shoes off and this kind of bugs me. However, I sit on my mat. She tells us to put our feet in front of us, bend our knees and roll back a little bit then forward a little bit, so you’re just rolling back and forth on your tailbone. I think, “Tailbone? Why aren’t we rolling all the way back so it goes through our spine? Maybe she has some kind of plan.” So I do it. Then she starts talking about something way off topic. A minute goes by and people are still doing this. She starts fussing with something in the corner of the room. Now another whole minute has gone by. I’ve stopped rolling on my tailbone because I think I’m going to get uncomfortable, but some people are still doing it. Then she starts talking about food. By this time I’m off of my pelvis and I’ve come onto my knees and I’m sitting there in a hero’s pose waiting for her to tell us what she wants us to do next. She starts lecturing about something, I don’t know what. I just realized that in the dream I thought it was a man that was leading the class but it’s not till the lecture starts that I realize it’s not a man, it’s a woman and it’s not because the appearance of him, it’s because I get a glimpse of the name tag pinned on her thready sweater that says, Stephanie. I’m thinking, “Oh. Ew.” Then, she pulls something out of her pocket, takes a bite out of it, wraps it back up and puts it back in her pocket. She’s talking with her mouth full and it’s gross. I’m really disgusted by this person. Now about fifteen minutes have gone by and she still has everybody in this rolling back and forth on the tailbone thing. I’m thinking, “Okay, shoes on, baggy corduroy pants, thready sweater, name tag, this isn’t even a yoga instructor!” They’ve pulled her off the desk from somewhere and told her to go in and teach a yoga class and she’s stalling. I lean over to the person beside me on the left and we make eye contact and I say out loud, “She’s just stalling for time.” Then the person on my right has moved their mat, which isn't a mat, but a flannel sheet that they’ve folded up into a mat shape, close to me so it’s one inch from mine yet there’s two feet of space between them and the mat next to them. I lean over and look down the row. The woman has got something going on at that side of the room so people shuffled to make room for it. But I know she’s not actually doing something, but staging to stall for more time. I tell the person beside me, “Can you please move about six inches that way because you’re in my space?” They do. They pick it up and move that way. Now I’m bored so I lie down on my stomach and put my head on my hands and think I’ll just close my eyes and rest until the hour is over. Then she tells people to get up onto their knees and put their hands together “as though you’re doing your prayers.” I think, “What’s the point of this? We’re going to be on our knees for like fifteen minutes.” I don’t do it. About five minutes go by. Now she’s at the back of the room and she’s doing something else. Suddenly there's a garbage can and she has things spread out all over from the garbage can. There are some people on their knees but most people aren’t doing it. Then there are two people with someone in between them and they’re supporting the person with their arms on either side and the person is limping. They’re carrying them out of the room. I think, “Really?” I say to the person in front of me, “How could you possibly hurt yourself in a class where nothing has happened?” The three people leave and I think that maybe they just staged this in order to escape this horrible yoga class. I realize I’ve said this out loud and the people immediately around me are laughing. The woman comes up that’s teaching but not teaching and she’s asking what’s so funny but no one will tell her. All of a sudden, a portal opens up and I’m in a different room. There’s someone with a camera and it’s me but I’m also watching. There’s this beautiful woman and she’s turning in a circle and moving her arms so that they look like they’re actually moving faster than they are. The way the light hits her body, at the moment the picture is taken, it looks misty and the light is hitting itself and refracting off the mist. It’s an absolutely gorgeous shot. I want to recreate this so that I can take a picture and have a picture. The person that has taken the picture, I turn to them and say, “If I give you my camera, will you take the picture at exactly the moment I tell you to?” The person agrees. I walk forward into the alcove and stand there. I start turning around in a circle, lifting one arm up, moving the other one to the side, and then when I get to the 180 point I switch arms and turn my body and switch arms. So I’m turning and I’ve turned enough times that I start to see that light, it’s circling around and coming back and I know when it hits my arms it’s going to expose the mist that’s already in the room. I say, “Okay, take it now!” They do. I leave the alcove and come back and look and there it is, it’s caught the light on the water droplets. I thank them. Then I’m back in that horrid yoga room again. It’s almost over. People are lying face down or are they just lying like that because that’s how I was lying when I left? Then I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream1
1900,1506,,20/12/2020,12/20/2020 00:07,"“Dinosaurs” I’m in a two-story building with my friend who owns a yoga studio and I teach for her. We’re walking around the studio which is completely empty and she’s telling me her plans are for creating things and developing a successful business. I do mentor her somewhat in real life so as she’s telling me these things, she’s asking me what I think. I’m giving her honest feedback and encouragement. The other thing I’m doing is I’m keeping track of her ideas, writing them down on a piece of paper for her that I will give to her once we’ve gone through the building. We complete the room to room itinerary. She has to leave first, so she rushes off. I say, “My coat and boots are downstairs so I need a minute to go collect them.” She says, “Oh, that’s okay. I have to leave, though, so just turn the lights off and press the alarm when you go.” She exits the building. I go downstairs and the lights are on in every single room because we turned them all on as we were going. I’ve left the lights on. I feel a little spooky being in the building by myself because it’s dark out. And because the lights are on inside and it’s dark out, all I see is the reflection of the empty rooms in the glass of the windows and it’s making me feel a little on edge. Instead of turning the lights out from room to room as I go downstairs, I choose to leave them on. My plan is to get my outdoor clothing on first and then retrace my steps, turning the lights off so I can dash out the door. However, when I reach the floor with my boots and coat I see what I think are two dogs that must have come in when my friend went out. They’re wrestling with each other but they’ve also twined their bodies around my boots. They’re wrestling so quickly and viciously that my boots are shredded to bits within a moment. I’m stunned. I’m standing there in shock. I want to grab my coat because it’s winter and it’s freezing. Now I don’t have any boots. I notice as they pause and untwine that one of them is a velociraptor. The other one is a similar kind of dinosaur but a little more muscular. They sense me looking at them but they’re also shocked for a moment. I run through one of the doors into a room and I slam and close the door. They don’t seem to see where I’ve gone. I wonder if I can sneak around through another room, come out a different door and if they might chase into the room where I’ve gone and try to get me through that door so I can slip back and grab my coat. I start to do this. I can see them through one of the interior windows as I start to go into the next room. They can sense me and they’re looking around but their bodies aren’t moving, They haven’t located where I am yet. They’ve moved away from my coat and what used to be my boots. I follow my plan. I enter into the same room they are, but now at the opposite end of it. I grab my coat and now I have my coat. I put it on and the door is closed. I’m just about to leave when I see that both of my cats are in the building. I can’t leave them in there! There’s no way. What can I do to get them out of the room where the cats are? I re-enter the room where they are. Now they’ve run back to the boots. They must have known I was in the room at the opposite side and took my coat, so they’re over there. I run back into that room and grab both of my cats but one is really wiggly and I know I can’t make it outside safely without dropping him. So I drop them back in the same room that I went into when I left the other room where the dinosaurs and my coat and boots were, only the problem is it doesn’t lead to the outside. But at least the cats are safe there. Now I have to distract the dinosaurs one more time by going back in there one more time so they stay at the opposite end, giving me time to open the other door and exit out the back door. I do this. I manage to get one cat out and put him outside. I hope he’ll stay. I run back in, get the other one, close both doors, and then shut them. Now the dinosaurs are throwing their bodies against the outside door. They know what I’m up to now and they’re really angry. I can hear their nails scratching against the door. I’m afraid they’re going to shred the door. I don’t have any boots and it’s freezing and my feet are on the ground. I’m wondering how I’m going to get home without my boots. And I have these two cats I have to carry. I don’t have a leash, there's nothing. All of a sudden my friend pulls back into the parking lot in her car. I’m waving to her and she sees me. She comes out and says, “What’s going on?” I tell her what happened. She’s strangely puzzled and doesn’t really comment on the dinosaurs. She just asks me if I want a ride home with the cats and I say, Yes, thanks.”",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream2

I went out to the waiting area and it was like a completely different hospital. I saw a guy and asked him if there’s anything else I could do - just to be nice. He said he wanted a map. I pointed him in the direction of the station for guest services and then I went over to the guest service station. But somebody cut me off and I had to wait to get them up and she told me it was because she had an appointment and she was a billion package. I was annoyed but I waited so I got him set up to leave the hospital. Then I went back on my unit to get ready and everyone was due to me, so I was trying to assess people and invite them down to group. People were on computers in the group room which is also not a thing that we have, but I had to manually turn them off. Somebody got physical with me and I had to put my arm out to protect myself.

I sit on a stool and ask for a cup and hot water so I can make my own tea. My husband comes in and walks behind the bar. He’s casually leaning back against the bar and talking with the people. We all seem to know each other. I’m wondering where my son is. He comes in and passes through. Then I don’t see him for a while. I assume he’s with somebody who’s watching him. The guy from behind the bar comes over to my cup because I’ve asked him for a tea strainer. Instead of giving me a tea strainer, he pours warm milk into my cup. Then he pours a huge amount of loose tea, so much so that it is overflowing from the cup. I’m surprised and ask him what he’s doing. He says, “Oh it’s really, really good tea. Just wait and see.” I think he’s ruined my cup of tea so I sit back and let it steep, whatever he’s done. I start to get worried because I haven’t seen my son in a while. I look around and see that he’s not in this room where I thought he was. I ask my husband if he’s seen him or knows who he’s with. He doesn’t know and he isn’t concerned. I’m looking around frantically and see a ladder to an upstairs loft. I think he might be up there. I climb up. On the upper floor are lots of beds separated by curtains, lots of cushions and pillows. I see a little girl curled up asleep. But I don’t see my son or anyone else. I’m getting more frantic and worried. I see a door that leads outside to this big grassy area. My husband comes up the ladder and asks me if I found him. We go out to the garden and are looking around. An older man comes strolling up to us. He asks us how we’re doing and wants to strike up a conversation. I’m not interested in pausing for a conversation because I need to find my son. My husband looks across the way and asks, “Where is the most likely place he could be?” I see a big climbing dome and a lot of kids playing on a playground. We go running over there. I’m looking all around and calling for him. Finally I see him and I’m so relieved to see him. I pull him to me tight and I’m both angry and happy. Then, there’s an overlap with another dream layered on top of it. I find out Hanna and Shelly are moving and selling their house. I’m over there and I’m sad that they’re moving. I enjoyed living in the same town. Hanna pulls me to the side and says, “We’re not actually moving from the town. We’re just selling the house and downsizing because we can get a really high price for it. We’ve found a smaller house.” Shelly is fixing up the well and has dug out a big hole beside it. I go inside to look around. I go into the bathroom and Hanna shows me some weights. She says, “Shelly lost it and got really angry and threw the weights around.” I ask if they’re all okay. She says, “Yes, we’re all fine. This just happens sometimes.” They are not planning on telling anyone about the details about their move because they don’t want that to lower the price that they can get for the house.",Ana,last_nights_dream
1905,1507,,21/12/2020,12/21/2020 00:04,"“The Coffee Pot” I’m standing on the sidewalk of an avenue that has wrought iron gas powered lamps. It’s snowing out. There’s already about a foot of snow on the ground and it’s still snowing. There’s a little shelf of snow overtop the tree branches and street lamp and on the railing of the porch where I live. The porch is a nice porch; you can walk up the stairs and there’s lots of space and you could comfortably sit there at a table and chairs if you wanted, but I don’t. The house is brick. It’s beautifully architected, two or maybe three stories with an attic at the top. The roof comes to a peak, it’s taller than it is wide. It’s old. I can tell it’s old because the glass isn’t flattened by a machine, it’s hand-hammered. I can feel all the care that went into the materials that created this house. I’m looking underneath the bench for my coffee pot. It’s a coffee pot that sits outside my front door. The bench is built right into the deck like a wood shelf, just a simple bench you might sit on to take your boots off or something. It likes to roll underneath there. I say ‘it likes” because it seems to have a mind of its own and I find it in various places around the house, sometimes it disappears but it always comes back. It’s about eighteen inches high, comes up to about my knee and it’s mostly black. It looks like it’s made of cast iron but it’s not because it’s light when you pick it up. I think it’s this material that allows it to flit in and out of this world. It’s long and skinny with a pointy lid. There’s a shinier tarnished silver around the rim of the lid, the point of the lid and a couple bands around the long slender spout that curls up and around at the top. It’s definitely a mischievous coffee pot. I give it space. When it disappears I’ll sometimes look for it. I’ll brush the snow off it then set it back down on the porch as though I like to tell it where its place is in a playful way because I know it’s going to disappear and come back again. This day it’s missing. I have a roommate. She’s more like a neighbor but she’s part of the house, too. She comes to the front window of her side of the house or her room. She sticks her head out because I’m tromping around on her porch. You know how you stomp your feet to shake the snow off? I’ve been crawling around looking for the coffee pot under the bench so I’m covered in snow and stomping to shake it off. She looks at me and raises her eyebrows. I say, “Have you seen the coffee pot?” She continues to look at me but doesn’t nod her head yes or no. I say, “Just in case you’re around the back of the house or somewhere or if you’re out walking and you see it, could you please bring it home?” She puts her hood back over her head and pulls her head back away from the window. I just stand there and recall all the other times the coffee pot has disappeared, gone on some kind of journey and come back, and I’m recalling that when it comes back, I pick it up and hold it. It’s like it’s trying to come back to the house but it lands in different places. I just sometimes have to help it make it back to the front door. It’s like once I set it down again by the front door, it vibrates a little like it’s happy. When it’s been gone for a little while on one of its journeys and I pick it up I can feel through the pot almost where it’s been. It’s like every time it comes back it’s a little bit different. Sometimes it’s been in a different country and time, or a different universe and a different time. It’s been used in a slightly different way. The metal that it’s made of has reacted to its environment because the environment is different - a different temperature and different composition. It reacts to all of that. When it first comes back and lands, I find it and can feel that through it. I know I would be really sad if it never came back because its journeys make me happy.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

There were normal laser guns, snipers, mounted gatling guns, and bombs.

At each end was a base which was a structure off to the side providing cover and more mounted guns.  The last fight was more difficult because they were using cover better. I was behind one of the gatling guns using mouth noises to indicate that I was firing at the giu camped directly outside of our base. At one point I ran out and found a green cone like Object and gave it to the other team. It was an item to make their gatling gun more powerful. He thanked me but barely gave me time to get back.

There are bugs and things that only move in the dark and webs. No one ever uses it. We have a few things stored down there. There’s no electricity in the whole place. The torch in the torch holder is lit and we each have torches that we hold beside the one in the holder so we each have a light of our own. The only thing we can see is what the torch lights up, so as soon as you move from that spot you can feel the heavy damp of the darkness behind you. I’m sticking pretty close to my brother. There are some old things from when we were babies - the high chair, a trunk, and some other things like that. Then there’s a passageway that leads off. It’s like a crawlspace and there’s no way I’m going in there. I turn around and my brother is gone. I can see his torch light and he’s in there looking around. How can he do that?! He’s in it for about ten minutes. I’m not freaking out, I know he’s okay. Nothing bad has ever happened to us in this place. I trust it, it’s just creepy. I don’t like all the slimy scuttling things and I don’t want them in my hair. I’m on edge. He pops out and I say, “What did you find?” I don’t know what he says. This isn’t the first time he’s been in there and he was checking on what he had in there. He says it’s good. Then we go back up the stairs which are really rickety, and up into the kitchen. There’s a dug out place beside the kitchen; it’s just dirt with big stones. My dad is standing there and he says, “Alright, let’s go take stock of what’s in the barn.” My brother and I still have our torches in our hands but we put them out when we came up the stairs. The torches are all made of wax and now they’re shorter with more wax drippings on the outside because of the time we spent in the basement. We go out the side opening. There aren’t any doors, just openings. The kitchen does have glass on the windows. We go over a meadow into this other place. The stones are piled up. They’ve been chipped away into roughly big square shapes and stacked on top of each other, sawed and stuffed into the cracks to keep the weather out. Grass and bits of organic matter and seeds have grown in the sod. This is what the whole thing is made of, every structure. Now we go into the structure my dad calls the barn. It has a side entrance made of this sod packed stone. We go in there. The whole thing is one big open space which is why my dad called it the barn, except we never had any animals. There had been animals at some other point. We look around. Again, we take our torches. But the torch in this structure has never been lit. My dad has the lit torch. When we get in there, my brother and I put ours on his. Mine won’t light. My brother’s did. I’m calling to them, “Wait, wait, my torch isn't lit!” He comes back. Mine is being really stubborn and takes a little while to light. It does but it's very dim, it’s like it’s wet and it won’t stay going very well. I’m not doing anything except trying to keep up with them. There’s nothing in there. There’s a place we didn’t explore, it’s another passageway off the barn. My dad turns around and says, “Okay that’s good.” I say, “Are you sure? Because there’s a lot of stuff in there. We need to organize this so that when the real estate agent comes, we have all the categories of all the places on this property written down and they’re evaluated separately or we won’t get the value we deserve.” My dad says, “I don’t care. I just want to sell it.” I think he makes some comment about his age and says it doesn’t matter due to his age. I’m arguing with him and say, “Well that’s precisely why you should get out of this property what you deserve. You’re not working anymore. This is what you have to support you through your age.” Now he’s thoughtful. He just doesn’t feel like doing it. My brother and I decide to finish it on our own. We leave the barn with my dad and walk around the outside. I see that there are so many different kinds of fruit growing around - wild cherries, peaches, quinces, pears and apples. I wish I had time to gather these and preserve them. Now we’re back in the kitchen and have a little bit to eat, just some bread and a wheel of cheese. I don’t eat any of it though, I just give it to my dad and brother. Some others who are part of our extended family come to the table that is handmade out of wood. There standing there. Some of them have fruit in their hands and are eating as they gather around. This is where I identify my daughter and her ex-boyfriend. I say, “We need to go back down into the basement and take more stock of what’s there.” We do this. My brother spends a lot more time in that one passageway. He’s growing something in it. I say, “You’re going to move that though. Whatever it is, you need to move it before the real estate agent comes.” He says, “Yes, I know.” Then he gets thoughtful and I can tell he’s thinking where he’s going to move it. He says, “Maybe I’ll just move it further back because no one is going to go in there.” I think he’s right. I worry about him because no one knows how far it goes. No one has gone far back including him. This makes me feel on edge again. Now we exit the side building. The real estate agent and lawyers will be here shortly. No one has gone through the barn yet. My brother, daughter, her ex-boyfriend and I light our torches and go into the barn. Mine is doing the same thing where it won’t stay lit but the barn is brighter because there are now four torches. I see the passage at one end actually connects to the house, but instead of going underground, it goes above ground and I find it odd that we haven’t noticed this before. The odd thing is that even though there’s nothing there and the barn is a lot dryer and there are no creepy crawlies and webs and spiders and night living things the way the basement had, I always feel a presence at my back like beings you can’t see that are in there. It’s thick with them and I can feel it. We go through the bends of the passage and we end up behind the house. I say, “Instead of entering the house through the side, my dad’s probably in there with legal people, we should go underneath so we’re quiet and don’t interrupt them.” We agree to do this, but the passage takes us into where they are. We’re sneaking around trying to be really quiet and all of a sudden my dad and the lawyers see us and we all start laughing. I say, “We didn’t think you would be here. We were deliberately trying to be quiet so we wouldn't interrupt you.” My dad remarks, “Well you never know where the passages in this house are going to lead.” Everybody thinks this is funny so it takes some of the tension off. However, I can’t shake the feeling that there are other people living in this house who we haven’t found. As I’m saying this, I look up and see the glow of a torch from inside the wall and it’s way up high in the place between the room off the kitchen and the kitchen, it’s in that wall. The wild cherry vines had covered it up but the cherries have gotten really ripe and they’re falling off because they’re so heavy and ripe, so I can see this crack in the stone. I get my dad to lift me up. I’m heavy, an adult size, so I can feel his arms shaking. He can’t hold me up for very long. I got a glimpse of people in there! There’s a dad and a mom. He puts me down. I say, “You need to lift me up again. I saw a man with a hat on.” Someone else lifts me up and this time the arms are steadier. I see a baby strapped onto the mom’s chest and a young boy the age of nine who has covered his face with the same kind of pointy hat his dad has. I notice the mom has one of those hats, too, but the point of hers is tipped over to the side. There’s a whole room we didn’t know about and they live in this room. He puts me down and I say, “We need to find the passageway that leads there to tell them the house is being sold.” I think the buyer is going to tear it all down and I’m worried about this family. We go through the passage again only this time we’re looking at the walls trying to find cracks. I know where this should be directionally. But once we’re in the passageway, it’s hard to keep your sense of direction. We’re in the barn again and I feel the presence. I turn around and this time it startles me and there’s the man with the hat and veil over his face. I say, “You’re the man from the room in the wall.” He says yes and I share with him that it’s going to be sold and I think it’s going to be torn down. He says he has nowhere else to go with his family. My brother says, “Well there is somewhere else.” He indicates the passageway where he has been growing things. The man says, “Oh we’ve come from there and I don’t know if I want to go back there with my wife and kids. I’ve considered it but my wife wants to stay where we are and take our chances.” The dream ends with us having this conversation of where there is to go after there and the sadness that someone would even think about tearing down this magical place that holds so much history. We’ve lived there and survived. The water is pumped from the ground with the handle. We have torches. We don’t need the electricity. We’ve been able to survive on the fruit around the house. I don’t want to leave and neither does the man with his family.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I was nervous about it and I wasn’t wearing a mask, but I was covering my face with a white tissue. We were all driving somewhere and then we pulled over to this big dusty parking lot. We were going to get in the shuttles and I got really nervous about going in the shuttle. This big group of kids on tricycles and other things came charging through the parking lot. They were all black kids on tricycles and some other things. It looked like they knew where they were going. The next thing that happened was everybody came down a tube-like thing, like a slide, and one at a time. My nieces came down. Then my sister had a guy there and I didn’t like him. I knew that it wasn’t my ex brother-in-law but he had a similar energy and he was trying to impress the family. I did not like him at all and my sister was nervous about him meeting the family. She took forever to come down on her slide turn. Then we were in this car and I was trying to put these credit card numbers in and take turns with other people I don’t know. We’re in really close quarters trying to get these credit cards to work before we got to the game. Then I was carrying the speaker box and the front of it had lights in a Christmas tree design.

The lady said, “you don’t have room to put a ball between you and another person so probably a large or an extra large, just go grab them.” So Dr. Donovan and I went to go find large and extra-large off the racks.

His dad is wanting to make it into an entertainment room. He buys a big futon and sets it up. He’s very childlike in his excitement about this futon. He’s showing it to me and wants to make sure it’s the right size and fits and is not too heavy or too stiff, and it’s comfortable and in the right place in the cul-de-sac. It’s so strange because it goes between being outside and being an actual room. As the dream progresses more and more furniture shows up and the room starts to be enclosed with walls on two sides and then sliding glass doors on the other side. Curtains show up. There’s a couch now and a piano and side tables etched in gold. It’s quite fancy, actually. Josh’s dad is asking me, “Is this how you want this room set up? What do you think about the placement of all the furniture? What about the tv? Is there a better place for everything?” I’m looking at it. They have the tv set up against the sliding glass doors and the curtains are drawn. I’m like, “No, I think there’s a better way than to block these doors with furniture.” I can feel myself standing there contemplating a better arrangement. But they’re so happy with how it is. They’re trying to convince me of why it’s good. I’m like, “Yeah, just leave it, let it be.” Then the dream ends and I’m in a car. We’re driving around this same cul-de-sac and trying to figure out how to get back to that room. His dad is like, “I think if we take this way, we’ll end up where we want to be.” I can see that there’s this gate in between that cul-de-sac and where we want to be. If we go right, it takes us up a hill and I keep going like, “I don’t think this will get us where we want to go.” It’s very interesting, I just know that even though we can see that cul-de-sac and I can actually see the futon he bought, we can’t get to it in the car we’re in. we do have to drive up and around.

1922,1509,,23/12/2020,12/23/2020 00:04,"“Decorating” I’m back in the house at W Square. My brother and my niece have come to visit. They’ve brought some things with them. Everything they bring has to hang from the ceiling. There’s a swing and a light fixture. My brother has brought so many things for the kitchen that he has built another cabinet that goes where the stove used to be. Now I don’t seem to have a stove anymore because there are cupboards there now. My niece’s dishes are in there and there are internal racks so the plates stack on their ends. I look to see what’s in there and the plates are plastic and made of ivy so they don’t hold anything. I question why these are so important that they need their own space. My niece replies that she likes how they look. I would rather have had my stove. I’m saying this out loud and asking my brother his plan for the stove and where he’s going to put that. He’s busy putting the new light fixture up on the ceiling. It’s about four feet long by one foot wide. There are three wire cages that have round discs on them. The last one is a really long dunce hat shaped cone and it’s just a bare bulb. It’s really, really bright. He’s installing it and he’s busy with his tools. I go out into the hallway. I’m putting up the swing in the living room archway. I’ve got a hook for it. I insert the hook into the stucco of the ceiling and I’m turning it around and around and around until I feel it grab. There’s not much hook left and I’m skeptical that it’s going to be able to hold any weight once the swing hangs from it. I hang the swing from it anyway with the intention to ask my brother once he’s done with the kitchen to come take a look and see if he concurs with my conclusion. While that time is passing, I’ve got two great big vases that they’ve brought and some flowers. I put one on the table that’s just inside the hall and another on a long skinny table in the hallway just before the living room. I arrange the flowers in it. I’m standing back and admiring; I like how these flowers look in the two vases. They make a nice diagonal line of flowers when you open the front door. In fact, they arrange in perspective, one behind the other so it looks like there’s one giant bouquet of flowers. I think this perspective is interesting. While I’m kind of lost in that perspective, my niece sits on the swing and is swinging on it. I notice that the hook is separating from the ceiling just as I suspected. I say, “Stop swinging!” and I grab the swing because I know one more swing would have taken the whole thing right out and some of the ceiling would have come out with it. I’ve caught it in time and she gets out of the swing. I take it off the hook and get some glue and some of the material that the ceiling is made out of and I put the glue around the hook. I’m sticking the material with the hook to the stucco ceiling and am repairing the hole. I have this idea as I’m screwing it back in that now it’s a permanent fixture and I didn’t know that they were going to stay forever and now I’ve made this swing forever. It’s done now. I go back into the kitchen and we’re setting up for somegames. My brother has made this big chart and they’ve gone out to get food. I’m in the kitchen by myself and looking at what he’s done and figuring out what everything is for. I still wonder at the practicality of taking up so much space for these plastic plate ivy underlays. I notice that I’m squinting because the light from the ceiling without a shade over that long cone shaped bulb is so bright. My niece comes in and says, “Oh look, this is supposed to go over the light.” It’s this beautiful cone shaped Tiffany lampshade. I put it over the light bulb. It not only makes the light comfortable, but it’s really pretty. I notice as I screw it over the light that you push it in so it accordion-pleats over itself, so now it’s no longer this long dunce cap shaped thing, it’s flush with the other two round plates on the ceiling. I’m relieved about this. My brother has returned with some games. He’s got a piece of bristle board that he’s going to use as a chart to keep track of the scores. He says, “Look what I’ve done. I’ve put your son right across from you on the chart and your daughter on the Y-axis and your daughter across from you on the X-axis. Here’s the point where you are and I’ve made it just a heart.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

1924,1276,,24/12/2020,12/24/2020 00:01,"I’m with Josh in a house. I’m in a living room that looks 70’s-ish with wood paneled walls. We’re babysitting or watching some younger kids, maybe. It feels more like we’re hanging out but these girls show up who are looking for a party and knew he was there and wanted to find him. I’m like, “Whatever, I don’t know what y’all want but you need to move along.” Most of them leave, but this one girl won’t. She’s young, maybe 17 or 20. She is coming on so hard to Josh and I’m like, “What are you doing?” I’m not jealous because we have an open relationship, but I’m like, “Girlfriend, what are you doing? You need to know what you’re looking for and asking for.” She says to Josh, “Can you fuck me?” He’s like, “No.” But she won’t stop. He’s like, “Okay, if that’s what you want.” At this point, she’s taken all her clothes off and doing the most to seduce him. They get down right here in the living room. I’m kind of watching but also on my way into the bathroom, so i’m seeing this out of the corner of my eye. He goes to put his dick in her and she starts screaming because his dick is too big for her, she’s small. She’s screaming, “Give it to me, daddy,” but also screaming in pain. I’m like, “Uh, nope, this isn’t okay.” He’s like, “Do you want this or not? What is going on? Make up your fucking mind. Nope. Uh uh.” I’m over here going, “She’s in the wrong. He’s in the wrong. This whole situation is fucked up. None of this should be happening at all.” The scene shifts and I don’t know what happens to the girl. Josh and I are together again and hanging out with some friends we’ve played with in the kink scene before. We’re at dinner and all coupled with their other person. There’s a sense that Josh is trying to make sure all my needs are met and I’m just being bitchy and making it kind of impossible. I’m watching the other couples and seeing how they’re interacting. Eventually he’s like, “Which seat do you want to sit in at the table?” I’m totally bitchy but finally sit down next to him. I’m ornery as fuck for this whole dinner and basically being a total brat. Internally I’m having this struggle because outwardly I’m being a total bitch, but inwardly I’m like, “Can you please just love me love me love? Please just see through this bullshit and just love me.” I’m acting this way in front of everybody and it’s so out of character for me. Then the dream shifts. I’m with Josh and our friends. There’s another woman who's dressed as a cop and has all these puppies. She’s like, “I have these puppies. You guys have got to take the puppies.” Me and our other friends are like, “Puppies, yay!” Some of the other friends are like, “I want to see the puppies.” I ask, “What type of puppies are they?” She says, “Mom is a dachshund and also a sheepdog. Dad is a pitbull.” These puppies are interesting looking and all dark grey like pitbulls. They’re cute. When you line them all up, some of them look like dad with bigger heads and jaws; some of them take after mom with longer bodies; some of them have super long ears; some of them are much smaller than others. For some reason they’re being kept in the freezer drawer. My alarm bells start to go off. Josh and the others are looking at the puppies. I’m like, “Take the fucking puppies out of the freezer! You’re going to kill them all.” I grab all the puppies. Mom is in the freezer, too, and I grab her out. I have no idea where this freezer shows up from because we’re outside and the puppies were in a box in someone’s truck then they were in the freezer. I pull them all out and am like, “I don’t want any of these puppies. I don’t want a dog or the responsibility. Yes, they’re cute, but I don’t like dachshunds.” But someone needs to take care of these puppies. Josh is like, “I want them all!” He’s very childlike in this. I’m looking at him and am like, “There’s no way! We don’t have time. That’s a commitment. No. I don’t want these puppies.” But I also don’t want them to freeze so we have the puppies. The dream shifts again. The woman who brought the puppies is now on a fucking rampage! She’s trying to kill people. I am now observing. There are multiple families and multiple homes who are afraid of her and they’re trying to make sure she doesn’t kill them. She’s got booby traps in houses and she’s super stealthy and trained in killing. I think she’s a cop because she’s still wearing this cop uniform. I’m watching Josh and other people protect these families. It’s really hard because she has booby traps and she’s really good at the killing piece. It’s all different kinds of families: moms and dads with kids as well as just couples. They all live in one neighborhood. She’s making the rounds. The dream shifts again. I’m going shopping for velvet clothes. I want a velvet jacket and velvet pants and a velvet dress shirt and a velvet dress. I think Josh is around. I’m in a dressing room trying the clothes on.",Rose,last_nights_dream
1925,1510,,24/12/2020,12/24/2020 00:02,"“The Firefighter” I have a new puppy. I’ve put him on a towel beside my bed. I’ve just set my teacup down on my bedside table and I’m debating whether or not to take him out one more time before I go to sleep. He’s not housebroken yet. I know I’ve just taken him out so I think I have a couple of hours to sleep and I’m really tired. I close my eyes and go to sleep. I wake up abruptly, something startled me, a noise. In that startle, my arm shoots out and knocks the teacup off the bedside table. It falls to the floor and smashes. I pick the pulley up from the towel and wiggle my feet into my shoes. I walk out of the bedroom, up about five stairs and outside. It’s still the middle of the night, though. I set the puppy down in the grass. He snuffles around a little bit and I hear him peeing. We walk a little farther so he can poop. I think that he does so we go back in the house after spending a little time outside. I put him back on the towel, take my shoes off and get into bed. Then I look down and there’s poop on the towel. I think, “Oh no, I didn’t stay out long enough, I thought he pooped.’ I get another small piece of towel and pick the poops up. I walk across the hall and flush them down the toilet. I pick up the two towels and am looking around for something to put them in. I notice I have a dog crate in the corner but it doesn’t have a tray in the bottom. I wonder if you can buy those separately. I’m trying to find another towel, a clean towel for the puppy to lie on. Then some people that I know from yoga start to file into the room. The room turns into a gym. I still have the puppy. People are wanting a yoga class now. They see the puppy and start talking about him instead. They ask me what kind he is and such questions. There’s a commotion at the side of the room and I see two firefighters. They’re both dressed in the fireproof coveralls and one of them has an axe. I wonder if there’s a fire going on and if we should be vacating the room. I pick up the puppy again, put him under my arm, and approach the two firefighters. One of them looks familiar and I feel like I know him from somewhere. They say there is a gas leak. The one that I think I know says I should come with him while he shows me the sight of the leak. We climb up a ladder, the kind you’d see in a submarine that goes straight up. There’s a small opening that also goes straight up. I give the puppy to my friend and climb up the ladder following the firefighter. When we get to the top, it’s like the landing on the upstairs part of my house. There’s a big wheel, like the kind in a submarine that you turn. It’s like a waterproof lock over doorways. He sits down beside it and says, “That’s where the leak is; it’s down there.” He indicates the other firefighter and says, “He went down to shut it off earlier but he left something down there and it could still be open, so he needs to go back down and turn it off.” He turns the big wheel, takes the hatch lid off so it’s open, and the other firefighter slowly descends down the stairs. We know it’s going to take a while. For some reason I think it’s about half an hour. The guy I know is now sitting and anxious and he keeps taking his hand to the side of his neck. We need to sit here and wait because we have to open the hatch back up. There’s also the possibility that it might explode. It is quite nerve racking. I ask the guy I know if he wants me to do a little thai massage on his neck. He says, “Oh yes, that would be great. Just a minute.” I can’t remember if he says he needs to wash his face or wash his face and hands. I wait. I go in the bathroom and also wash my face and hands. I wonder if I should brush my teeth but I don’t. He comes back down. He takes a lot longer than I think. It feels like it’s maybe twenty minutes and I’m thinking we don’t have much time left before we have to open the hatch up again. He does come back up though and sits down. I do the neck sequence and the back of the shoulder sequence - just the seated sequence - and then the time is up. I sit across from him again at the hatch. He looks at me. I guess it’s the thai massage afterglow and he says, “I’ve never seen you like this before.” He’s gazing at me with this look that is open and maybe unconditional love.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

This bridge was at least two-hundred feet up from the water, really high up. It was a paved road so cards could go over it. There’s a huge gathering of people, so many, and I’m seeing them in the water. I have to look through a pair of binoculars to see them because they’re that far away. I’m trying to take a picture and am zooming in a lot to try and see everyone. Some of the people are waiting for me to jump in. I'm like, “No you’re crazy, that’s way too much of a distance, that will kill me.” I do not know what happens after I try to take the picture, but I’m struggling to take it and refusing to jump in the water. Then dream happens. Then there’s another scene. I’m in a house that’s quite cute, like a studio house. The bedroom, living room, kitchen are all one area. It’s in Portland area. I think it's late summer because there are green leaves on the trees and they are just starting to turn and it’s warm. I’m standing in that house. The cabinets in the kitchen are painted white and it’s very bright and cheery, very airy, too. I don’t know who I’m with, they’re my partner though. I go out onto the porch and there’s a bunch of kids sitting on the porch. The kids have helmets on, like they’ve been riding their bikes or skateboards. I’m showing them how to do something, but I don’t know what it is. They’re playing video games and maybe they’re showing me how to play or I’m showing them.

Things are a little strained between us. I ask him if he wants to dress the salad. He goes to get the olive oil and he spills it everywhere on the floor. I’m extremely annoyed and upset about this. My reaction does not make sense for the mistake he made. He can see I’m made. I’m just like, “Clean it up.” He goes outside to get a hose. I’m like, “What the fuck is he doing? Get a rag to clean this up.” Somehow the oil is spreading. I watch him go outside. I can see a fig tree through the window. The window is the kind we have in Hawaii with the old panes of glass. There are all these huge gorgeous yummy figs on the tree and I’m like, “Oh my god, I want to go pick those figs.” He’s out there getting the hose but he’s fucking around. Meanwhile the oil keeps spreading more and more. I don’t want to go out because I’d step in the oil and spread it some more. I can see there are chickens out there and the chickens keep trying to eat the figs. I yell at him through the window: “Pick the figs!” He goes to pick them but he doesn’t have a basket to put them in. The chickens keep going after him. He’s still messing with the hose. Then he turns into my dad. He’s a bumbling idiot out there and I’m super frustrated with the whole thing. I leave the kitchen and all of a sudden I’m in a grocery store co-op. There are a ton of plants. Josh, who has turned into my dad, has the hose now and is trying to come into the house with it to clean up the oil and water the plants. I’m watching him walk through the kitchen into this back room that’s a co-op. In this backroom are tons of starts. He goes to water them, but he has the hose on super high pressure and he’s obliterating all the seedlings. I’m like, “What the fuck are you doing? Where’s your common sense?” I’m so irate. At this point I just ignore him and the whole thing. I go into my room, but I don’t want it to be my room because it’s a smaller room. My sister is there but it’s not actually my sister, it’s another little girl who is my sister in this dream. She’s talking non-stop and I just want some space. I’m especially annoyed because she has the bigger bedroom and I’m like, “Why do I have this little one?” She has this little piece of paper with a calendar on it. The calendar has been pulled out of a magazine and the magazine is the flyer or coupon book for the co-op. I don’t even know if the dates are right on the calendar, I think it’s last year. She’s pinned the calendar on the wall for me and I think that’s useful. But then I look at the dates and see that it’s not useful. She’s pinned it over the one window in my bedroom. I’m like, “Why have you pinned it over the window?” I go to pull it off and it has just regular blinds over the window. She goes, “Because it stares into my room.” I’m like, “What?!” Sure enough, I go and look and all I can see is her bedroom. I’m like, “Oh yeah, let’s put curtains over that.” She goes to put a curtain over it and the curtain is the same color as the walls. The walls are a very light bright bluish green. I’m hating all of it. I don’t like this wall color, I don’t like this curtain and the curtain doesn’t , I don’t like the size of this room and I don’t like that she’s in here. This is not what I would choose for my space at all. Why the hell am I here? My mom comes in and is trying to smooth things over. I go outside. She follows me outside. We go outside because there is a gorgeous sunset happening and I want to catch the sunset. But I didn’t bring my phone or camera. I tell my little sister to grab my phone. I’m in my twenties or thirties and she’s six or seven. She takes her fucking time but by the time she comes back the sunset is gone. It was a beautiful glorious sunset. I try to pick a few of the figs for myself. Now I look up and in the night sky and I can see the Earth and Jupiter and Saturn making this cluster in the sky. I start taking pictures. I can see the continents, clouds and oceans of the Earth from where I’m standing, which I thought was earth, but apparently it’s not. Then to see Saturn and Jupiter, I think, “Well of course I can see them close together, it was the Great Conjunction.” All of a sudden Earth becomes a meteor and Jupiter and Saturn go with it. They start to burn up like when a meteor goes through Earth’s atmosphere. I’m panicking. I’m in the yard with the kids. I’m looking down and can see buildings like in a city. These two kids are Indian from India. They start to laugh as the Earth travels through the atmosphere and starts burning up. I’m horrified but they’re laughing like it’s the greatest prank in the world. Then I realize that it’s a ball and they somehow managed with magic to make it look like Earth and Jupiter and Saturn. It is going to burn up as it comes through the atmosphere and it will land and make an explosion, but it’s a ball because it stays the same size. They’re laughing hysterically because they’ve just pulled off this prank. I’m horrified because this entire dream I’ve just had this sense of where am I, why am I here, what am I doing...I’m trying to find bits of beauty, but I miss the sunset. I do see Earth, Jupiter and Saturn, but they seem to be fake. I go back into the co-op and the manager of the co-op is there now. The co-op is filled out now. I see grocery store shelves stocked with fruits and vegetables, and aisles with alternative flowers. The co-op manager is trying to hire people. He gets on the PA to talk about the benefits of working at the co-op. He says something like, “You have at least one weekend day off.” I’m looking at him like, “No way! I would never work there.” I’m kind of laughing because he’s awkward on the PA system. But it does sound terrible the way he described it. The dream ends with me looking at him with a puzzled look on my face. My mom, dad and sister have all disappeared from the dream. There’s one other co-op employee hanging around and rolling his eyes as he hears the manager talk.",Rose,last_nights_dream

I played a few chords with difficulty, then realized that I needed to strum it. It sounded like something from a Spanish song.

There’s this big white fur rug in the middle of the floor. I think maybe this is home. The rug needs to be vacuumed, so I’m trying to vacuum it and make sure I don’t pull any fur out, but the vacuum isn’t working. I think maybe I’ll try to comb the whole thing out, but it’s tedious and taking a very long time. I try to come up with another way to clean this large white fur rug. He and I are talking about and while we’re talking, a mutual friend (again not anybody I recognize from real life) comes in. She is straight and has long dark hair. She’s practicing to be a wedding planner. This other woman is here in this room to see her. Me and the gay man are fussing with the rug. The two women are sitting at a table. The one who is learning to be a wedding planner or something is organizing something for the other woman. She has baked twelve different kinds of cake with different flavors and either buttercream frosting or fondant frosting. The cakes are all different colors. Some of them have gold foils, berries and flowers. They’re really gorgeous. Maybe there are twenty of them. There are so many that they don’t even fit on the table. It’s crazy because the woman who is going to be the planner is actually putting the fondant on the cake as she is having the other woman taste it. I want to have some cake and keep going, “Hey is that cake gluten-free or grain-free by any chance? Can I eat it? What’s in the fondant?” I love fondant icing and really want to try some of the cakes. I get a little leftover piece from one of the ones they’ve already tasted. They can’t decide and so far no decision has been made. I get a taste of one and don’t think I want to eat this because I’m pretty sure it’s not gluten-free. I do have a nibble of the fondant and it’s okay but kind of plain. I do end up having a crumb of the cake and it’s burnt. I’m like, “Oh god, all of her cakes are terrible, but they are beautiful.” But they taste like crap. The scene switches. I’m outside and heading to a doctor’s office. I see my friend Beth and her son at the doctor’s office. They’re ahead of me in line. I say hi to them and then am talking to a bunch of younger girls. I don’t know who any of these girls are. I don’t know why we’re at this doctor’s office. This is unusual because I would never go to a Western medicine doctor. But I’m there waiting and trying to talk to Beth who is kind of talking to me, kind of not.

1945,1511,,28/12/2020,12/28/2020 00:01,"“The Long Anxious Drive” I’m in a car. There are two people in the front seat and I’m in the back seat. The person on the driver’s side is male. He has dark hair and those sideburns that I think they call lamb chops or dog ears because they come down from the temples and into this ear-shape around the jaw line and towards the chin, and they’re a bit long because I can see them sticking out from his face. He has two cars and I’m saying to him: “Why would you pick this car instead of your other car? There’s only one car like this and it stands out. Now we’re going to be really obvious.” He doesn’t reply. We’re stuck with it now because if we go back to his house to switch cars, the police will know that we’re there. We’re trying to avoid being detected by the police. We’re trying to avoid being caught. I don’t know what we’ve done. There’s nothing in the car and it’s almost as though we didn’t do anything but we can’t prove our innocence. So we have to avoid detection. We’re also trying to get to a particular destination. This is also what’s adding to the anxiety. The driver is sticking to the main roads. I’ve told him several times that if he just goes off the main road there’s a whole grid of side roads that will take us the same direction, but the chances of getting caught on a side road are greatly reduced. First we’re on a highway. It looks like the old Number 7. Again, I’m saying, “Why are we on this highway? It’s the only main route that goes here and there are police on it all the time.” He finally agrees to go off on a side road, but it’s not the one I suggested, it’s the one that takes us in the opposite direction. I think at least that will shake the police for a little while because they’re going to be looking for us traveling the opposite way. We do this for an agonizingly long twenty minutes. It feels like hours where I notice every single little thing as I’m looking at the windows. I’m hypervigilant and looking out the back window to see if I can see a police car. My eyes are glued to the back window. Then I suggest again: “If we turn around and take one of the side roads going the other way, we’ll be getting closer to our destination instead of farther away from it.” We’re running out of gas so we have to stop at a gas station. This makes me even more anxious because what if there is an APB out on the license plate and the gas station attendants report us. It’s just horrible. We stop for the gas. I’m watching the attendants and ready to jump back in the car if it looks like one of them is going for a phone. I’m standing at the back of the car to try and cover up the license plate with my body. It goes well at the gas station. We get back in the car. No one has called the police. We start going the other way. Then the driver, when we get to the highway again, he turns left so we’re on the highway. Now the highway has stop lights on it and every two minutes there’s a red light. This is making me crazy with anxiety because now we’re going even more slowly. I finally convince him to turn right so that we’re on a side road. I can relax a little. I realize how unbelievably tired I am, yet I still can’t go to sleep. They’re driving. I’m looking out the back window and I can see some headlights. By now it’s dark and all I can see are the headlights and they’re really, really bright. I think this is it, we’re done for. But then the car behind us with the headlights turns off to the right. I feel a little bit relieved. Then there’s a stop sign and the car stops. I have my eyes peeled out the back, I don’t see any cars coming. We start driving again. The whole dream goes on and on like this, painstakingly slow and horrible. Then I’m aware that I’m dreaming and I’m aware I’m awake. I’m aware of the dream. My conscious mind says it’s had enough and doesn’t want to dream this anymore, so I just get up and turn on the lights.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream1

There’s a hallway with a niche off to one side with two couches facing each other. There’s a long room that’s empty. I’ve been teaching in the long room - meditation, it’s a yoga teacher training. It goes really well. I’m happy with the session. The studio owner I used to work for is sitting on the couch when I come out after the session and she says to me: “I have no further need of your services. How much do I owe you?” She gets out a checkbook. I tell her that she owes me for all the sessions she booked me for, not just the one I finished today. She says, “Oh I don’t have to pay you that.” I explain that she does because I turned down other work in order to hold those days open for her. Then she kind of freezes, the way they do in plays where one person freezes then the spotlight turns to something else. I see sitting on the couch across from us, a student of mine. He tells me that she has hired him to work for her. I say, “Oh.” I’m debating whether or not to share with him how she treats people, just to warn him. Before I can say anything, he says to me, “Yeah, she’s asked me to come in for the next couple of Sundays just to see how I do.” I say, “It sounds like you’re volunteering.” He says, “Well, she said that if I do a good job, she’ll pay me at some point.” I say, “Are you okay with this?” He says, “Eh well, I was going to be around anyways, so I don’t mind doing it.” He tells me the times and dates that she asked him to come by and teach her group. It’s the other two dates that she booked me for. I’m thinking that just figures, she’s found a way to get someone to teach for free. He seems really uplifted or excited by the idea that he’s just a new fresh grad and already teaching a teacher training. He’s confident and stuff and I don’t really want to take that away from him, but I’m also really disgusted by this kind of treatment of the sacred teachings of yoga. There’s no way anyone fresh out of a 200-hour teacher training is experienced enough to pass on any kind of wisdom. She’s just using it as a money maker.

There’s a husband and wife who live at this house. I don’t recognize them. I’m working for them, but I don’t know why or if I’m actually being paid. They’re having me paint something. The guy is like, “Here’s the roller, here’s the paint. Paint these things.” I’m painting but know I have to go somewhere. The wife and two daughters come out of the house. They’re all white people. One of the daughters is maybe a teenager or in her early twenties and the other one is around ten or so. They’re like, “Okay, it’s time to go.” I put my roller down and leave everything where it is. I get in the car with them. There’s an infant and my mom. My mom has the infant. We’re all trying to squeeze into this tiny Toyota Corolla that’s all beat up and doesn’t have seatbelts. There’s no car seat for the baby. They set the baby down in the backseat behind the driver. I’m so horrified and so mad. Their treatment of the baby this whole time has been so callous and uncaring. She’s a little baby girl all bundled up in blankets, maybe six months old. I’m really upset with the way they’ve been treating this baby. The older daughter, maybe it’s her baby, is driving. We’re driving through all this traffic. One of them is smoking. I think they’re heading to a daycare for the baby. I’m horrified and upset. We end up at a gym. I don’t know what happens to the baby, the daughters and my mom. My partner Josh is there and also my old weightlifting coach. I’m like, “Eh, why am I at this gym? I can’t lift anything. I’m super weak these days. Maybe I’ll watch you all spar.” There are punching bags and a ring for MMA fighting. He is doing olympic lifting. I see him go into a headstand and crash and tweak his neck. He gets up and just shrugs his shoulders and rocks his head side to side and says, “I’m fine.” I’m like, “Oh dude, you’re not fine. You just jacked up your neck. I saw it.” He says, “Yeah, it’s time to go.” I’m like, “Where?” The house with the yard is there all of a sudden. He just walks into the yard. It has this wooden fence all the way around it. The pieces of cedar are really close together, touching, and about six feet tall, so you can’t see into the yard. I get back in the yard and the husband, the owner of the house, is there. He’s like, “Hey you left without putting our paint stuff away.” I’m like, “You know I had to leave. I was just doing that until it was time for me to go. I didn’t have time to put it away.” He’s really upset with me. I’m like, “Okay, well, I’ll clean it up next time before I leave for my other job or wherever I have to go.” Now they’re cooking this gigantic barbecue and there’s still stuff for me to paint. I’m painting and they’re making food. They’ve got grills out and picnic tables set up and all kinds of condiments and food. All kinds of neighborhood people are coming and everyone is white trash. I’m done painting or at least the guy comes over and says, “You’re done painting. Go help clean up all the mess of the food and the party.” It’s feeling very Cindarella’ish at this point. I’m like, “Eh, am I getting paid for any of this?” I go to clean it up and there’s this lesbian woman who has been working the grills this whole time with the husband. She’s younger, maybe in her twenties or early thirties. She’s like, “Here, you do this, this and this. And this is where you clean everything up.” I’m picking up trash and moving things around. I am not living my best life and I’m not excited about what I’m doing. But I feel almost like an indentured servant and I don’t have a choice about what I’m doing and I need to finish cleaning up the hamburger. At some point there’s an area on the fence with all of my clothes hanging. I’m wanting to change my clothes to get into my work clothes so we can go to work where I get paid. As I’m looking at these clothes and trying to decide what to wear, the husband and other family members are ridiculing me about the clothes I’m wearing: “Oh you’re too fancy for us. Where are you going in all those clothes? You’re too good for us.” They’re poking at me and I sort of lose my confidence and desire to change my clothes and go out into the world. I’m also pissed off about cleaning messes that are mine because they’ve left and told me I have to clean up everything from the neighborhood barbecue that they hosted. I’m just feeling defeated by how much work there is and how I’m not getting to the things that I want to do.",Rose,last_nights_dream
1953,1513,,29/12/2020,12/29/2020 00:04,"“A. Street” I’m back on A. Street, which is a street I bought a house on with Omar and a couple of other friends. We bought it to flip. We took everything out of the house when we bought it, including the drywall, the plumbing, and the electricity. We created three apartments from it. I lived in one on the main floor for a little while until the basement was fixed up into an apartment, and then I moved out. I kind of supervised the building, collected the rents and did day-to-day jobs that a landlady would do. In this dream, I’ve returned after being absent for a long period of time. It’s because I want to sell the house and I want to move myself. It’s like I’m living far away from there like I do in waking life. In waking life I want to move and I’m trying to get the money I need to do this. I’ve got a couple houses picked out that I want to move to. They’re across the street from the Fairground. I just don’t know how much they are. I’ve contacted one of my friends who is a real estate agent to help me with this. She meets me at the house on A. Street. We enter. We start looking around. She’s doing it with her real estate agent’s eye. I’ve got a clipboard with paper and am going to write down the things she says to do to stage the house and what she arrives at as an estimated value. As we’re doing this, the tenant comes down from the upper floor apartment. She talks to us for a little while about mundane things. Then she says that she would like to move into the main floor apartment when the house sells. I tell her, “Well that’s a good idea except that you are on student welfare and they pay rent directly to us. This apartment is much more expensive than the smaller apartment that you have on the upper floor. How can you afford to pay for this? Are you working now?” She says she’s not working but she thinks she can budget so that her student welfare still covers the more expensive rent. I tell her that I don’t think this is realistic and I do some math with her. I say, “This is how much your rent is, here’s your utilities. You won’t have anything leftover for food after that.” She says, “I can make it work.” I say, “I’m really sorry but this isn’t realistic. I can’t sign off on this.” She walks away disappointed. The tenant that lives on the middle floor is not present, but I have a key to go through his apartment. In the dream, I’m thinking that he’s away. But at the same time my conscious mind acknowledges that he has passed on. His apartment has been vacant for some time. We go through it and note that it needs some paint and some cleaning. We go back down to my apartment. My cats, who I have brought with me, one has gotten out to the backyard. I’m wondering who left the back door open. I go into the backyard to pick it up and notice that the other one has got out. I don’t understand this because I brought them in a carrying cage which I set down in the kitchen while we did this walkabout with the real estate. It feels like things are starting to get out of hand already. I’m in the backyard and notice that there is a tenant in the basement and there wasn’t one there when I left. I can hear some loud music coming from it. I wonder how we’re going to get in. Now I’ve got both cats under my arms and go back up the back porch stairs. I put them back in the carrying cage and firmly latch the door. I tell my friend that there is a tenant in the basement and I’m not sure if we can look in that apartment. She’s already on it. She’s pushing the door to the apartment open and I tell her, “You can’t do that. That’s the door to the apartment. You have to knock first.” She thought it was just a walkway. So she pulls the door closed again and knocks. This guy comes to the door. He’s wearing jeans and no shirt and he smells like beer. I feel a little bit nervous, but she’s quite confident and asks if she can look around. I don’t go in but she does. I hope she’s okay. She comes back out and makes a few more notes then goes back up to the kitchen. We sit down on the couch and she starts going through the things that need to be done. The whole thing needs to be painted and it all needs to be cleaned. She has a few extra things like door latches and some fixtures. She says, “All in all, you should be able to get this ready for about $2,000.” I think, “Well, I don’t have it, but I can put it on credit. That’s not too much to come out of the equity.” Then she says, “But I have something else here we’re going to have to put on the windowsill when we have the open house.” I look at it and think, “What’s that?” It says, “Writ of Sale.” I say, “What’s that?” She says, “It’s a lien. The mortgage was not paid on the property. So the bank owns it.” I wonder how this could possibly have happened? I paid all the rents religiously every month they went in the account. Who has used this house as collateral for something and never paid it? I wonder if one of the other two partners has done something surreptitious. At that point I see Omar and he’s walking by the front of the house. I go out the door and am trying to talk to him but it’s like he isn’t really aware of me or the house, he’s just walking by. I can’t talk to him or get to him. Now I’m really disappointed and can feel that in my heart. I’m not going to be able to get the funds together to move. I don’t want to sell the house and disturb any of the process that was already in place before I start to try and sell it. The tenants have been paying the rent. Whichever one of the partners who have set this up to repay the debt, I need to leave that in place, or else I’ll end up being financially responsible for something I didn’t do. I ask her, “How do I reverse this? How do I stop this process that I’ve put in place?” Now she’s talking to her boyfriend who’s sitting on the couch and they’re talking about a concert that they’re going to. They’re going to see Teenage Head at an outdoor amphitheatre just on the edge of the reserve. I think, “Oh, I didn't realize Teenage Head was still alive or that they had done more than one album.” The boyfriend says, “No you’re right, they only ever did one.” I respond, “So, they’re just going to play all of those songs?” I wonder why people would go see a band that hasn’t been around for so long. I think maybe they have a strong local following and that’s when I wake up.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

Some structures have been built up here. The ritual is for the sun. i don’t know if the sun is setting or rising. It’s very dark. All I see at the horizon is an orange ball of light. There’s a change of plans. Now the ritual is happening in the pool. There are a lot of people. The only one I recognize is a mama friend. We talk on the steps leading into the pool. I don’t recall anything about the conversation or the ritual. I’m talking with Mary about human origins. She says something about the latest research and the shape of your legs. She says she can tell me about my origin by holding my breasts in her hands to weigh them and get a sense of them and me. I agree and shift my shirt and bra to the side. She does so. She says, “Oh you are a brigar peggis mortae.” She steps back and points to these flanks hanging up on hooks. They’re samples of different species. She points to the one that is my origin. I can see that each of the forms have differently shaped acetabuli. I think, “Oh! This shape is why I never could be a professional ballerina.” I see other shapes that would have allowed me a better turnout for ballet.",Ana,last_nights_dream
1955,1281,,30/12/2020,12/30/2020 00:01,"I’m in a house with my mom and my dad and some of my siblings. There’s a vague sense of people. My mom and I are in the kitchen. She’s cooking. I’m trying to load the dishwasher. It’s a very complicated dishwasher and I’m trying to get the dishes in. She’s standing right next to it and sort of in the way. There’s enough though. I’m standing in front of the sink and the dishwasher is to my left. I’m trying to get the dishes in but the dishes seem never ending because whoever’s cooking, her and someone else maybe my dad, are making a lot of dishes. At one point she stops me and hands me a bottle of beer and says, “Can you please open this?” I’m like, “Why? I don’t drink.” Even though it’s beer, it’s got a wine cork. She finds the wine opener and corkscrew and gives it to me. I open it but the whole time I’m like, “Why are you all drinking?” We’re at a gathering, maybe it’s Christmas or New Year’s, I don’t know, but there’s a celebration happening. Of course, it’s my family, so they’re all drinking and I’m the only one that doesn’t drink. I’m thinking, “Why am I opening this bottle for her?” I think she’s trying to give it to me, but I’m like, “No, here’s your bottle of beer-wine.” I put it down and leave. I sort of get tired of all this. I go out of the house. All I can see are impressions of mountains and the very classic Swiss Alps landscape. I’m looking down from a high vantage point, a bird’s eye view. I can see houses down below and the mountains and a river. This is where everything gets really fuzzy. I remember the frustration of getting the dishes in the dishwasher, especially the silverware, trying to get it so it doesn’t fall through the holes in the basket, and the weirdness around so much alcohol and my parents.",Rose,last_nights_dream
1956,1514,,30/12/2020,12/30/2020 00:02,"“Coconut Milk” I’m in a house. It feels like a potluck atmosphere with a lot of different people. One of my friends who is a dietician and her husband who is a physician are there. I’m not sure that I recognize anyone else. In the kitchen, there’s a woman. She’s brown and she’s helping me put together the food. There’s a long table and many different dishes on it that people have brought. I feel like the woman in the kitchen is teaching me how to make some things that I want to learn how to cook. She tells me to go get some coconut milk. I leave the kitchen and go into the pantry. It’s quite a vast pantry with lots of shelves and very well organized. I’m reading the labels and nothing is quite right. All the cans that I think are coconut milk aren’t. I’m in there a long time trying to find coconut milk and I think I’ve been gone too long. I come back out and tell her I couldn’t find any. She remains silent, she doesn’t reply. Then I leave the kitchen and go into another room. People are gathered and seem to be playing some kind of game. The atmosphere is one of levity. I sit down on the floor. I lie on my back then turn on my side and go immediately into child’s pose. I lift my torso away from the ground, roll over to my other side, and then onto my stomach. From my stomach, I roll onto my right side and immediately into child’s pose, then lift my torso and roll to the left and onto my back. I’m making the movements really smooth. Then I suddenly feel my friend’s husband, the physician’s leg touching my leg. In the middle of this movement I open one eye and I see that he’s also on the floor and sitting there. He says, “How can you do that so smoothly?” I say, “I don’t know. I just can.” I do it again, the movements. He’s trying to do it. He tries a couple of times but he’s not as fluid. I don’t really know how to help him so I close my eyes and continue the movement. It starts to feel like a sport where you do fluid movements and it doesn’t matter what they are as long as one part of your body is touching the other person. This starts happening. I’m not really looking at what he’s doing. I’m just continuing to do these movements. A little bit of time passes and now I’m just in child’s pose and stay there instead of moving through it. Then I remember about the coconut milk. I stand up and ask my dietician friend if she’s seen any coconut milk. She says, “Yes, I think I saw some.” She disappears into the pantry and I go back into the kitchen. The woman has got sweet potatoes but it could be squash cut into fairly big cubes. I’m curious about the dish that I’m going to make with the orange vegetables and coconut milk. I’m thinking about the spices to put in here. I’m thinking about turmeric and chili and maybe achiote or cinnamon.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream

I suspected there were terrible monsters inside. An order of religious warriors stood outside. They stood in formation carrying fully body wooden shields. If they had weapons it was only a staff or a shield. They didn't believe it was dangerous inside the church and were terribly unprepared. I was supposed to be one of them, but I wasn't going on their suicide mission. I went to where there were more of the warrior priests and donned my uniform. I would blend in but would not go inside. But once I entered the line of people going into the church, everyone shoved me to the front. I tried to get away but there was no escape. The doors opened and a monster came out before I could shut them. It was a mace lying on the ground threateningly. It had a wooden shaft and a large bulbous three pronged head of metal or stone. I pulled out my weapon, some sort of bolas and began hitting it repeatedly as it lay on the ground. Then I was in a minivan crashing through the doors. I climbed to the front of the car and out the open front which had folded out and below.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

We took an elevator to the top floor of what looks like the space needle in Seattle and we sat down at the end of this crescent shaped couch. I kind of had a bad view of the play or festivities, but then an unattractive guy sat down next to me. He was black and tall and wearing a gray sweater and jeans and boots. He was sitting with people that he knew. We all said hello and then we went around and said our names twice. The play started and I couldn’t see my family but I was okay and somehow the guy next to me put his arm around me and started kissing me. He was a really good kisser and in my dream I remember thinking it’s been so long and I was embarrassed because I felt like there was so much spit in my mouth! I eventually excused myself to use the restroom but before I did I looked down and my nipple was showing! I left Pinto there in the stroller while I went to the bathroom and I was gone for a while, maybe seven or eight minutes, and I was blowing my nose trying to get the last of everything out because my nose was running.

1961,1282,,31/12/2020,12/31/2020 00:02,"I’m with a ton of people I don’t know and we’re on a tour. The astrologer who I know from my studies is there and we’re in this huge area that reminds me of the Hawaiian Hilton where they have these big fake rocks by a pool and you can climb over and around them and there’s a slide you can go down. So we’re in this building with lots of rocks and water, but it’s also an old sewing shop. There are all these sewing patterns everywhere, still in their envelopes. The woman who owns the shop is showing us around. But it’s not a shop, it’s way bigger, and an open space. The tour is over. To get out of the building, you have to climb in a very specific pattern over these rocks. I watch somebody ahead of me. We get to this one section and it’s kind of like bouldering. Instead of taking hand and footholds, they decide to slide down the rock face, thinking it’s not so far. I watch them slide and am like, “Oh, that’s far.” They land in the pool beneath them, but the pool is not particularly deep.” I’m like, “Oh no, okay, I’m not going to do that.” Then the astrologer goes and she’s a much bigger woman. She shows me how to use the handholds and footholds. She misses and falls down the rock face. I’m like, “Oh no, this is not good.” I see some younger girls, like nine or ten years old and I watch where they put their hands. They manage to get down off this part where the others were sliding and slipping. I follow them and end up in this place where there are even more patterns lined up on a bench. I recognize some of them from my mom’s sewing patterns from when I was a kid. There are other ones that are new in their envelopes. I’m looking at them but not spending a lot of time because I know it’s time to go. I just kind of try to keep going. Then the dream switches. I’m in a house that I’m sharing with a bunch of people. We’re in the kitchen area. I think it’s mostly women and possibly my friends Shawna and Janet from high school, but I’m not sure. There are others I don’t recognize. I’m in the kitchen. There’s a double cupboard that goes from floor to ceiling. You can open these tall doors and get into the cupboard. The top cupboard has a bunch of glasses in it and I’m looking for my black nail polish. One of my gay flatmates has used it all up and I’m pissed up. I’m like, “Wait, I want my nail polish.” I’m looking in this cabinet for it. There are champagne flukes and port glasses and really heavy-bottomed cut crystal water glasses. They keep getting broken so there’s maybe one of each of them. I’m trying to move them around so I can look for the nail polish. I’m handing them to my roommates to put them in the trash. The trash is overflowing. I’m handling these pieces of glass and trying to be super careful, but I don’t know where to put all the pieces. I gather up the trash bag and head out to the trash, which is the dumpster area by the condo area that I live in in this reality. Then the scene changes. I’m with a younger version of Josh, he’s maybe in his mid-twenties, and all the people who were part of my kink family this year. There are some additions, girls I don’t recognize. We’re in a car going somewhere. We’re going through a town that reminds me a lot of Hawaii. I feel like we’re in Kona. Josh is on the lookout, scanning for other women to fuck. I’m with him and ignoring it. We’re driving by the ocean on the other side of the rock wall. We’re going past buildings. I can see surfers out in the water. I’m ignoring Josh and the constant scanning that he’s doing. Some of the kink family is in the background. He’s flirting with them like he usually does. I’m like, “I have this chiropractic appointment and so do you.” We’re on our way and end up at the chiropractor’s office. It’s an open office because I can see other people watching. Josh gets his adjustment and the chiropractor cracks him really good, not the way I would allow anyone to crack me. Then it’s my turn and the chiropractor is moving really slow with me, which I appreciate. He gets to my left shoulder and is like, “Oh, there’s something wrong with your rotator cuff.” All he did was put his hand on the back of my shoulder blade. I didn’t tell him it hurt, he didn’t move it or anything. He was just moving me around and as he put his hand on the back of my shoulder blade, he said, “Ooh, there’s something wrong with your rotator cuff.” He gets these weird hooks with rubber bands connected to them. He hooks them all together and wraps them around my wrist. He puts one hand on my shoulder and he goes to adjust my rotator cuff. He’s yanking on it. I’m expecting to hear some horrible pop, but he’s actually really gentle and just keeps pulling on it in different directions. I’m not sure he’s going to be able to do anything and don’t believe he is doing anything. But whatever, I let him do it because he’s not hurting me. Then I come out of the dream a little bit and I realize that my chin is tingling and I need to go put some helichrysum and ice on my chin to stop my cold sore from getting worse. That was somehow part of the dream, too. I’m on a cell phone and I can hear everybody on my council talking. I’m listening in like I normally would because we’ve been doing our council call on zoom because of all the things. I contribute my two cents to whatever is being spoken about. One of the other council ladies is like, “Rose, are you there?” I’m like, “Yeah, I called in.” I think it was Aila. She’s like, “I didn’t even know that my phone was on and you could hear me. Did you know we were meeting today?” I’m like, “Yeah, I knew. Although I didn’t know you were all meeting in person. Did you all plan that?” She’s like, “Yeah, we didn’t think you were coming so we’re all meeting here in person.” I’m like, “What?! Okay I’ll just come and find you.” I go find them, but there’s that yucky feeling of being left out. I go and see them. It’s fine. Everybody is there and we’re all talking. For some reason the topic of dicks comes up. Aila is like, “Yeah, you should see the one I got!” I don’t know what she’s talking about. Did she get a dildo? Is she talking about her partner? I have no idea. Beth chimes in and is like, “Yeah, look at mine.” I’m sitting on the ground and turn to the right and look up. She has her pants pulled down and she has a dick that’s half chub. I’m like, “Beth! Is that yours? Did you get a sex change?” She’s like, “No, it’s my partner’s. I just took it for a while.” I’m like, “I didn’t know you could just do that. Okay.”",Rose,last_nights_dream
1962,1515,,31/12/2020,12/31/2020 00:03,"“The Talent Show” I’m at a Yoga Studio where I used to teach but stopped because they basically tricked me into working for them by promising me a certain rate but refused to sign a contract I asked them to sign. I worked for them for a whole month without knowing what I would be paid. They figured I would just keep doing it because I had formed an attachment to the people in the class. I’m just standing inside the front door of the studio. My son is with me. I see the owner’s daughter but I don’t recognize her at first because she’s lost so much weight, she’s even about six inches shorter, and she’s wearing a lot of eye makeup. I deduce who she is because she’s behind the desk, not because I recognize her. There are a lot of people and families in there and in fact it’s packed, which surprises me. The owner walks in and he gives me a cold glance and keeps walking. My son has mingled with the people, although I didn’t intend to stay, I need to get him to go home. The only reason I’m there is to pick something up from the desk. The owner’s daughter is looking for it for me. The director is the main person that wouldn’t sign the contract and kept telling me she was going to the next day and the day and the next day until I started teaching. She delayed until they thought it was too difficult for me to back out. She’s behind me and gushing about being so happy to see me. I feel like it’s a performance for the people standing around. She’s got one of her hands on each of my shoulders and she’s standing behind me but to the side. I feel repulsed by the fact that she’s touching me and pretending to be this beaming friendly person when she’s a viper on the inside. Then, it’s like I’m being moved forward by the crowd. I move with the flow because I’m scanning for my son and I need him because I’m ready to go. The owner’s daughter is standing beside me and talking to me. We get into the actual practice room and there’s a stage at the front. There must be two-hundred people in there, families, sitting on blankets and towels. She asks me if I want to sit down beside her. I agree. Then I gradually take in what’s going on here. It’s set up for kids. All the kids are wearing costumes and there are three boys on the stage. They’re setting up for some kind of act. I finally catch up with my son and he says, “Mom, can we please stay? I want to sing two songs.” The owner’s daughter indicates that it would be okay if we stayed. I tell him, “Alright.” We sit down. For the first act, you can’t even figure out what the boys are doing. They’re on for about ten minutes. Nobody is stage directing. It’s just really laissez-faire. Other kids are running across the stage as these three are acting out something, but it’s not cohesive, it has no direction. At one point, one jumps down from the stage really slowly and pretends to fall. The other takes a run from the side and slides across the stage. It just goes on and on. I think, “Oh my god, we’re going to be here for hours and hours.” That’s how the dream ends, just sitting and waiting.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream1
1963,1516,,31/12/2020,12/31/2020 00:04,"“Main Duck” I’m in a really big boat. It feels like one giant room with smaller rooms off to the side. It’s a boat-shaped space because the kitchen is more like a triangle and the eating area is more like a reception room. There’s a door at the stern end that goes into a washroom. There are other beds just tucked to the side. There’s a niche bed with a mattress tucked off the side of the kitchen. There are other beds in the eating room that feels like a reception room. I know there’s another one further ahead towards the bow where the kitchen is. That’s where the owner and his wife sleep. The owner is my friend’s son who I’ve sailed with before. We’re having something to eat. I’m not very hungry. I’ve brought a few things to eat that I just don’t feel like eating right now, so I’m just waiting. People are deciding what we’re going to do for the day. We’ve sailed for a few days then tied up at this wall. I can see the wall out one of the portholes. It’s cement. I can see the lines from the ship tying us there. There’s a town and we’ve decided to go into the town for the day. I think I’ll just eat there when I’m hungry. The town has some kind of museum. People are really interested in doing this. They’ve planned for a twelve hour day there. I think to myself that from the description of the museum, I can’t see spending more than a half an hour in it. I wonder why it has to be so long. I’m hoping there’s something else for me to do in the town. I go pack a small backpack with a bathing suit and a towel. I go into the fridge to pack myself a little lunch snack. I open the fridge and there are twenty-four individual sized salads that someone has made up. There’s a ham that someone has sliced and set it directly on the shelf and the ham juice has leaked all over everything and it’s really messy. I’m deciding if I want to take one of these or not. There’s no other food. Also, there are about eight dozen eggs and I think, “Wow, they sure eat a lot of eggs! Well, maybe if I cook a couple of eggs and put them between two pieces of bread, that can be my lunch for the day.” I’m looking around for something to cook the eggs in. My sailing friend comes into the kitchen and she’s also organizing food for herself. I thought we were going to be here for a few weeks, but we’re just staying for three days. That’s okay because there’s not a lot to do here and I’d rather be on the water and moving anyway. I don’t remember leaving the ship and going to town for the day, but I think I have. We’re back in the reception room. The owner’s son comes in and is talking about casting off now. I wonder why he’s going to leave right now because it’s a strange time to go. There seems to be some urge to leave right away. I just follow the instructions he gives because he’s the captain. I pack up the things and tidy up. Then, my friend’s boyfriend tells me that we’re going to be stopping at Main Duck. I say, “Isn’t that the opposite direction?” He says, “Well, that’s the direction we’ve been going.” I say, “Really?” I indicate where we’ve left from and where we’ve tied up and I say, “This is south.” He says, “No here, I’ll show you on a map.” He takes out an electronic map like a GPS on a screen. He shows me the path the ship’s made and we’ve been going the opposite direction the whole time. We’ve been moving from the states up into Canada. This doesn’t make any sense to me.",Freya Co'LM,last_nights_dream2

It was in a small and cramped room and my only chair was to the left if the quizmaster in the answer judge's chair. I decided that this would be fine and that I might have to be both coach and answer judge. The quizmaster was P. M..,Bob,last_nights_dream2

As we walked, it grew cloudier and darker and when I looked up, I began to worry that it would rain. We decided that we would turn back before we got wet. I took Luna and began running.  Then I launched myself into the air and flew, spinning and becoming like a tornado. I wondered how Luna was going to keep up, but for some reason I was not worried.",Bob,last_nights_dream2
1966,1519,,31/12/2020,12/31/2020 00:07,"I and a group of friends led by T. R. were hanging out at a bar. It was a pretty rough place with lots of unruly drunks, a private room in the back where some gangster types played poker, and a group of girls who were clearly prostitutes, though they were too young for that profession.   I was waiting at the front of the bar. Eventually a group of us went up to order, but I couldn't read the menu and didn't want to ask what kind of beer they had. I could make out ""coffee"" on the menu but didn't want to order coffee in a bar. I instead ordered a large water along with some food and planned to find a menu to read.   A drunk man approached and sat down. He was massive and was thankful he seemed to be in a decent mood and was paying no attention to me. He had been playing poker and I thought about asking him how the game was going but decided against it.   One of the prostitutes, a girl of maybe 15, approached me and sat down offering to read the menu for me. I was uncomfortable but wanted to treat her well so accepted her help. Another girl walked over, a black girl of similar age and I quickly said, ""I'm not interested."" Everyone else in the bar reacted to this, laughing because of how I had dissed her. They had misunderstood my intentions.   Things must have gone poorly for T. R. because he told us that we all needed to leave. I left the fawning group of girls and made my way outside trying to look like I was out for a stroll to stretch my legs. But when I thought no one was looking, I dashed across the street and down a side road. I noticed a black sedan with chrome trim but wasn't sure that it was following me.  T. M. asked if I had been followed and I told him about the car but also that I was careful and no one had seen me. I did note that with my poor vision it was quite possible that someone had seen me who I didn't notice.  T. M. was worried and it became clear that we were being followed. We ran for it and made it to a small thicket of trees and bushes at the top of a tall hill overlooking the road. They had pulled up several cars below. They began throwing rocks at us and they pelted us like hail. We had an old RV for cover but their rocks were going to break its windows. We went on the offensive and started throwing the rocks back down aiming for their cars. We completely disfigured both of their cars before they got in their vehicles and tried to drive straight up into the air to get to the top of the cliff. Fortunately there was a car parked at the cliff edge and I was able to push it over. It fell and colliding with the hovering car below, knocked it back to the ground. We managed to get the other one back down as well.  The dream gets fuzzy, but I think we went down with guns and had some sort of confrontation.",Bob,last_nights_dream2

I distinctly remember having watched a similar move with Grandma O. which was in German. I wondered if they had translated ths film but changed it slightly for its English audience. There was a girl with dark blonde hair and open hills and meadows. The movie wove in and out of the dream reality. Sometimes we were watching, other times we were in the film.",Bob,last_nights_dream2
