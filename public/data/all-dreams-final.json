Not actively, but over time. It's close. I remark to someone that I wouldn't want to live there. It becomes necessary to, I'm up on top with the house, and it's necessary to jump back down to the bottom. Sand? A beach? A smaller, younger person (?) who also has to jump. I coach him.

    "text": "“The Mission” In this dream I am aware that there are other beings in the world that we live in. They don’t have a body or faces. We can’t see them, I don’t know what they look like but I do know they are there. They reveal other parts of the dimensions that we live in when the right people are gathered together. Some of the people are oblivious to the fact that they’re supposed to gather together and others are not. So the dream flips between scenes where people are gathering. There’s always one person that is aware that the gathering has occurred. In each house where this happens, the curtains are supposed to stay slightly open, and when everyone has arrived, the curtains are closed. And then some other kind of message will come through, left by these other beings. It changes every time. You have to look for it, too. For example, one of them was actually underneath a flyer on a telephone pole. I was looking for the message and kept expanding the search area outside of the house to wider areas until I thought, “The messages are never this far away from the actual home.” So I retraced my steps and went back and found it underneath the flyer. There’s some violence in it that I can’t just speak of. What I came away with from this dream is that there’s a frequency layer on the planet where people just don’t care about the lives of other beings - whether animals, peoples or plants - they are just completely removed from the heartbeats that make things live. The other thing is that when the right people are gathered, you can evolve through that and you move past it. Not past the violence, but past the frequency that’s your everyday existence. But if you lived in isolation and didn't come together in groups, none of these fantastical conversations would happen when you discover something new. The layer of other dimensional beings remained with me when I woke up and I couldn't go back to sleep - it was that other layer of detachment and being observed that I really didn’t  (...)",

    "text": "“The Old Rusty Car” (from when I finally went back to bed) In this dream I have a picture of an old rusty car and it’s got a flat back like the kind you can open - I think it’s called a hatchback - only it’s been sitting and not moving for quite some time. The metal has rusted to what I find is a quite beautiful terracotta red-brown color. It’s rusted in panels - the panels of the car are slightly different colors of this terracotta. On the back - the hatchback - it’s made up of 7 different panels and instead of being different shades of terracotta, one is a yellow ochre - an artist color where the ochre pigment has some of that terracotta color in it - and another is a turquoise blue. Some of the panels are those colors. The contrast is absolutely gorgeous. You can see the rough pigments of the metal as it’s coming apart and it’s just gorgeous. I realize that as the dream opens and I have a picture of it, this car is actually a portal. So I’m seeking the portal in the dream. Interestingly, there’s a person in it who I knew as a teenager growing up through my twenties, not a close friend, but someone in my friend group. They had a farm on the outside of town and I was there a couple of times, and one time was an eclipse party when we went out there to watch the eclipse. Anyway, he committed suicide about 5 years ago and I had lost touch - we were never that close - and he was in my dream as a guide. His name was Craig. So I figured out the place this portal is - it’s like I carbon dated the paint pigments (I guess it’s because I do actually paint, I use oil paints) and they can only come from this one possible place, and of course it’s not on a map. So I’m hiking through pathways sequentially and I’ll go back, hike through, I don’t find it, and return to my own home, and go back other times. So I repeatedly went back and each time I went back, he meets me, this Craig guy, except for one time. And that time my dad met me, which is interesting because he’s 80 now and  (...)",

So I did, and when I went there I was told, and several other people as well, that I had to give her the name of the woman who had administered the test. The woman who said that was rather slender, and had a pinched face, icky. I talk to her and describe the woman, but couldn't remember her name, if I ever knew it, so I don't get paid. I go back to the first location, and the first woman is very helpful, her name was either Pam or Jan Bruer, spelled like that. I tell her, this is illegal. You can't add new requirements to a job after the job has been completed according to the original terms. She agreed with me, and wrote her name down on a card when I asked her to. So I go back to the payment location, and as I'm walking, I realize I have a pouch containing several items of memorabilia pertaining to this Pam Bruer. Papers of some kind, family photos, and I am puzzled and concerned as to why I have it. And now, going back to the payment location involves visiting the White House. I'm walking down this street, no longer downtown Centerville, and I assume it's DC. I'm having trouble finding the White House. There's a youngish man, maybe 30, wearing a business suit. He's fairly pleasant. I explain the situation to him. He tells me politely that it's won't be possible to see the president. I tell him I don't need to see the president, just someone, who works in the building. I had the name of the person's position though not the person's name.

We are required to bring a dish with us and he doesn’t want to cook something, so we go to a facility where we can cook it at that facility. So we walk to it. We enter the premises and it’s run by a temperamental chef. There’s a counter that has all kinds of small compartments in it and some really interesting tools. I’m looking at all of these and I pick them up and examine them and try to figure out what on earth they’re all for. My lover is talking to the chef because they’re deciding what the creation will become. I realize that all of these little tools are for making wine, but they’re like juicers that you hold in one hand, and that’s why they’re so tiny. You take each grape and put the thing that brings the juice out inside the grape and then turn it until the pulp comes out and then the juice. You do one grape at a time. I think, wow, this is interesting, but it would take such a long time. And then I’m looking at the other, there must be 50 different compartments in this table and they each have a different tiny tool in them. So I’m absorbed in figuring out what each of these are all for and I realize there’s a bit of commotion behind me. I look and there’s this giant cake with icing on it and my lover’s daughter is on the premises - she just appeared. She’s about 10. And she’s trying to taste the cake, of course, and because this dream is also in multiple timelines, I realize she does. But she hasn’t done it yet. Even though she has not done this yet, I see the chunk of cake come out where she’s taken the bite and I see someone else, not the temperamental chef, but a third party who has stepped in and fixed it by mushing some other parts of the cake to fill the hole and with his finger puts the icing across and dabs it across so it doesn’t look like a chunk has been taken out o (...)",

There’s no path. There’s no space between the trees and the underbrush. So, there’s just a clearing. My stepmother makes sure that I understand I’m not allowed to sleep in the main cottage, so I have a cabana - a small one room that fits a single bed cot. There’s nothing else in it, just a cot. It’s made of wood and it has a roof and a door. This is where I sleep and I have a flying machine - it’s made of metal and taffeta - weather-proof material that tents are made out of and actually windsurfer sails are also made out of it. It’s like a parasailor. I think in real life, people are led up to gliders to a cliff and then they’re strapped in and then they glide all the way down. This is what it is, only it has a bottom, so I can actually cross my legs, sit in the stretched taffeta material and operate the lever that will lift the wings out so I can go higher or lower that one side of the wing down so I start to come back down towards the earth. So I’m wearing a dress and I walk from my cabana down to the shore, get in my flying machine, and the wind just takes me up. And it’s amazing. It’s so quiet up there - the quiet has texture to it and it just goes through my whole body and I orgasm. I fly around for a while and then I shift the gear and come back down and land the plane. I’ve done this before and I have a picture of me flying it with a friend in it. The friend is there on the shore, but she won’t come up with me in it, although the dream is in multiple timelines so I know she has. She just doesn’t during this particular dream. And then my stepmother creates some drama. She doesn’t want it on the dock and stuff, so I speak to a neighbor and the neighbor tells me it’s fine to leave it there.

I’m feeling it’s more Mediterranean or something closer to the Equator, though it’s not as hot climate wise. It’s very colorful. There’s a lot of curves to the architecture and extra pieces added on, too, and it’s not just a box structure. There’s artistic pieces added on so it looks pleasing to the eye. It’s very artsy in this community. People make everything by hand. There’s a lot of thought put into it first. There doesn’t seem to be hierarchy of economy either or social standing. So what you eat, what you wear and your craft are all socially equal. So when you go to have food, you pick each item from the person who has created it. Then you create your food together. You can also go to a cook who is making food for others. You don’t just go in there, order at a counter and buy it. You have a conversation and then the cook shares a dish with you that he/she/they think you would like. So it’s quite different and very beautiful. I am a representative of life.

Everyone was eating, so I filled a plate with food, mostly meat, and took my seat at a long, rectangular table at the head. It was one of the few seats remaining. As the table filled, I realized that this table was only for family members. No one said anything to me, but I felt a bit awkward. His mother was there as well as some older grandparents.  I wanted to talk to A., but he wasn't at the table and he didn't seem to want to approach me. Eventually I rose and mingled with the crowd. I saw many people who I knew and shook a few hands, including that of the Jamison's youngest son. He was positively terrified of me and said nothing while reluctantly shaking my hand. I assumed he was merely shy.   A. walked up to me and we began to converse. I realized that Asher was just as uncomfortable with the current environment as I was and he told me that we should leave so that we could talk more. He left and I ventured out to meet up with him at the location we had specified.  Upon leaving the party, I found that I was at UCF and that my dad was walking with me. I knew that I had to find A. as we walked from the right side of the Chapel toward the Gym. We were walking across the soccer field between the two buildings and all of a sudden I was in the midst of a group of children playing soccer. The ball was soaring around me as if we were playing keep-away. I may have hit the ball a few times, but didn't get seriously involved. When we had moved a little ways further, I saw that my younger brother was with them. We waited on the sidelines for the game to finish and then continued with my brother. We spoke for a minute but I don't remember what we said.   I was on the other side of campus with my dad when we saw A. walk or drive past. We were next to my dad's car, but I didn't want him to drive me to follow Asher though he offered. I wanted to do this on my own, (...)",

My dad then distributed amounts to each of us around the table but not to me; he shook the bottle towards me but only drops came out. I felt left out even though I didn’t want the drink really (I don’t drink a lot in real life). This dream was sad, tense, and confusing.

The water is in a gymnasium or a large building and it has filled the gymnasium, almost to the ceiling. In front of us, there is an opening or a wall that has been cut away and I can see this scene of a bowling alley in front of me. There’s this strange line of the water. I can stick my head above and be in the gymnasium and stick my head below the water and see it flip so that now my body is above me in the gym and my head is breathing below the line where the water was as I’m looking into this strange bowling alley scene. Then the scene shifts and I’m in a long passageway. It’s small shaped like a chute and we can only swim through it. My daughter is still with me and we’re swimming forward. My dad is behind me at the end of this passageway. He’s urging us to swim, but he feels gross - he’s watching as my legs move, opening to frog legs. I feel this predatory sexual energy that panics me and makes me urge my daughter onto faster swimming. I don’t want to swim in front of him because I know he’s looking at both of us and I’m grossed out and horrified all at the same time.Then the dream shifts and I cannot remember any more.",

I have a photo of myself completely naked. In the photo, my upper body is facing the camera. My breasts are prominently displayed. The photo itself is sepia-toned like it’s been dyed with onion skin. I don’t want to give it to the owners but they had asked me to come up with a campaign or a slogan or a logo or something for the building. I’m very hesitant because I know that the wife is going to be derogatory and I don’t want to hear what she has to say. When I hand it to them the husband just looks at it with the male gaze taking it in and making some comment about my body which I am irritated with. And then the wife cops an eyebrow and asks why I thought that was a good idea. The scene changes and the wife and I are folding clothes together like you fold clothes at a retail store. She’s showing me these tan pouches that are closed with a zipper and are about 4x6. She tells me that these pouches can help you swim if you put them on your head. And now we are out in a harbor or beach and there’s a swimming race going on. I’m watching mostly men with these pouches on their heads swim out to a buoy and back around. She tells me that I need to swim and I don’t want to because I know that I’m out of shape and I can’t swim and my shoulder hurts. But she says that if I put the pouch on my head, I’ll be fine. It seems silly to me, but I do it anyway, but I can’t see because the pouch is over my eyes. The water is foaming. I can’t see anything as I’m swimming out to the buoy mostly trying not to drown. Then I turn around and dive under the water and suddenly everything is better. I can breathe under the water. I don’t have a stupid pouch on my head. I can see. It is crystal clear.

I walk past a front yard with a bunch of my friends sitting at a picnic table - three women sitting there talking. One of the women has long long hair - it touches the bench she’s sitting on. She’s in the middle with two other women sitting on the side. I’m walking down the street with a friend who is gorgeous. I stop and introduce her to the women.

We sit and chat for a little bit, and then we leave, continuing to walk down the street towards a house I’m staying in.There are a lot of people out and about. There’s a lot of people in this house. This house feels packed, like I’m a roommate with many many others. The house itself has a lot of things in it. It’s a little bit dark. I go to the plants on a windowsill that need watering. I water these plants while my gorgeous friend wanders around. I watch as everybody watches her and tries to watch her and make her acquaintance. Then the scene changes and I’m no longer in the house.

We're in this house, and the people who lived there are also there. Also some girl that I don't remember meeting, but my friend did something at the conclusion of which he isn't there. He's spending time with this girl in some other part of the house, possibly a bedroom. I'm a little irked, not really irked, no rancor, but puzzled was to what I should do, Disappointed. Should I just wait for him, or what? But that's not acceptable to me. He didn't ask my leave or even inform me of how long he might be, so why should I assent to waiting like some underling? So maybe I should do what I want to and leave, so I do. The house is well above the street. Woods across the street. It's 50 to 80 feet above the street, and a big rockery tumbling down. I go out the front door, somehow causing it to beep. I mouth apologies through the glass panel in the door. There's a lot of glass in this house. Rather than walk down on the steep path, I just push off and float down. I hear someone who I assumed was in the house, say, “It's all very well to do that in spirit, but where's the physical body?” I hadn't thought of that. Didn't become lucid, but there was this moment of awareness that you can't do that with a physical body. You'd go splat. The house was quite large, contemporary in design. The dining room was like a dining hall, longer than wide, a high ceiling with big clerestory windows. Halloween decoration up in the rafters, that hadn't been taken down. In the dream it was early January, the same time of year as it is now in reality, though it wasn't wintry outside. I experienced a moment of envy, as the house was much nicer and larger than mine. The kitchen counter was wooden, and not in very good shape. Stained, the finish gone, so portions were unsealed, didn't look good at all. Forgotten bits.

I had just come back from a busy day and didn't have time to be involved with the packing for the trip. We left and made the drive to wherever it was we were going. I'm going to say it was NY since Grandma O. was at the house or cabin at which we arrived. I remember it being a spacious building with wooden floors. As soon as we began to unpack, I realized absolutely none of my luggage had made it. I hadn't had time to load the car and no one had thought to get my stuff for me. I didn't even have shoes to wear which was going to be a problem as we were planning on hiking.   I told everyone that I would drive the 8 hours back home to get my stuff and be back the next day but we ended up deciding against this.   The dream went a little wonky after this and I found myself preparing for a hike on the Appalachian Trail. I was on the trail and came to a clearing where some of my friends were. I didn't have anywhere to stay and didn't want to pay to sleep in the ship-like motel which was a little further on. It was a giant ship where people were spending the night before continuing their journey the next morning. i looked for another place to sleep. I found a circular hollow or depression beyond the edge of a hill where homeless people slept. In the hollow was a dog and I figured I could sleep next to it. Maybe it wasn't friendly or someone else showed up, but I wasn't able to do this.   I went to the ship where I found J. C. climbing up and down the side. I joked that with how in shape he was he could do this all day to which he agreed. I did go inside the ship to look for a restroom and found myself in a small kitchen in what looked like an RV.   The latter part of this dream was very vivid and detailed though I am a bit fuzzy on it now. I may have continued to spend the night on the ship but I can't remember.",

The dream starts and I’m talking to them about a repair that I need for my car. I describe the way that it’s driving, the way the car is responding. I tell them that the gas pedal feels kind of sticky when I press it down. Underneath the car I can feel some things clunking around when I drive, so I know there’s something wrong with it. It might be the universal. The brakes have a funny feel when I press on them, although they’re not making any sound, so I’m suspecting that it’s the bearings. I know that this is going to cost a lot of money and I don’t have that much money yet. I’m also concerned that the mechanics are going to take advantage of me because I don’t know them and this town is unfamiliar to me. So, the people that I’m telling this to kind of carry on with the mundane tasks that they're completing around the house. I’m sitting at the kitchen table. They’ve wandered off now and I’m by myself at the table. I close my eyes a little bit because I’m sensing another presence there that I can’t see. I realize that Omar is telling me what’s wrong with my car. He’s giving me the exact words to use to describe it when I go into the mechanic. So I get up and leave. I get in the car, drive it up the street to the mechanic’s and I tell them exactly what’s wrong with the fuel system, using the words that he gave me. So the mechanics fix it. They do what I tell them is wrong with it. They don’t do a whole bunch of extra things. It turns out what I thought was wrong with my car would have been unnecessary. Instead of it costing about $3,000, it ends up costing much less. I’ve got a couple thousand left as cash because I had cash for this in my pocket. So I go back to the house and I tell them, “Yay, I got my car fixed! I have this much leftover cash.” And they’re saying, “Oh wow, that’s fantastic.” And I s (...)",

She’s upset and having a tantrum. At one point she clears the dishes out of the bottom cabinet and climbs in and shuts the door to hide. I think gosh, she’s always playing the victim. Then I’m in a house - it’s close by my childhood home. There’s a man living in it who’s apparently my significant other, but it doesn’t feel that way. He has longer dark brown hair and a long beard. He smells like patchouli and looks like a typical hippie selling sort of drugs or something. People are coming in and out. There’s an ocean behind us and I can feel the waves crashing. I want to be near the ocean, but he is putting on some sort of fair and he’s offering all his pickled goods for people to eat. I’m helping him serve them, trying to find his mustard that he made. It all seems so strange, I have no idea why I’m there. The scene changes again and I can tell that I’m in a small town in Europe somewhere, it feels like Switzerland. There’s an opera house. It’s been snowing and the opera house/theatre is huge. I’m in it and in the gift shop, but the upper level where they keep all the things for the witches, they say. I’m pulling out these drawers that remind me of the file card drawers from libraries. There’s all kinds of magical things in them. It’s dark up in here and I’m looking through them. Then I decide it’s time to leave. Now I’m in my car, which looks like a Toyota Prius, and I’m driving down the road in front of the opera house. There’s so much snow and I’m not sure how the car is going to get through. As I’m driving down, there’s a group of older white men standing on the sidewalk and as I get close to them, I see that one of them is my ex-father-in-law. I stop the car and roll my window down to say hello, and he and all the other men stop and stare at me and ask why didn’t I stop to let them go  (...)",

It’s more like where you would go see a movie because there’s one wall where you take a number and you sit in some chairs like when you go get your driver’s license. So you’re sitting there and there’s a whole bunch of different windows. And you wait there until your number’s called and you go up to one window and receive your feedback. Then you’re allowed to take your feedback to tables that are set up more like round tables, some are rectangular and long though, they are different shapes. You can order food and you can meet people, you can talk to other people. It’s full of people. The atmosphere is very loud - it’s almost like there’s music going on, like satellite music being pumped in. There’s no point where anything is silent. It’s busy. It’s moving fast. There’s a service staff there that’s bringing people food and alcohol. And I’m finding that it’s overwhelming. I’m overstimulated. I don’t really want to be there anyway. I took a bus to get there. I left my peaceful quiet home to get on this bus to go get feedback which I’m a little excited to see, but I’m also dreading some because with feedback there’s always some that seems to be laced with people’s jealousies, base emotions. People that give feedback don’t really understand what the program was. As well as positive feedback. So it’s with mixed emotions that arrive at this place, the Feedback Centre, to receive my feedback. It’s not clear on what program I’m teaching or participating in. Some of the feedback is just on conversations that you’ve had with people or things that you’ve said. So it’s vast and at the same time really specific. So I line up.

I leave the classroom that I’m in and head outside. There’s a bunch of kids - they’re younger than me and they’re not particularly friendly. It’s definitely a clique and I’m just watching them. They’re showing off and I don’t really feel welcome, so I leave and head to this classroom where another young woman is teaching and I love what she’s teaching. It’s all new and I’ve never run into it before, but it makes perfect sense and it’s a type of sociology about the way humans interact and how we communicate and can have adult mature conversations. The kids in this clique are in there, kind of, but they’re acting like they’ve heard all of it even though it’s all new to me. I’m just noticing the difference between my classmates who I was teaching who are older and these younger kids who seem to already know a lot and are very aloof. I sit down and have a conversation with the teacher who is maybe a little bit younger than me but not by much. She tells me about this raincoat or jacket (I forget the name she called it), but she’s showing me this things she’s wearing and it looks like a snakeskin where she cut a slit through the side of the body and can fit her head into when she puts it on it actually expands out and her arms go - one side goes down into the tail and the other side goes down into the head and expands and lifts up and out. It covers her like a cape, but when she takes it off it goes back into its snakeskin size and she just curls it up and puts it in her bag. I’m totally fascinated and she very much loves it and likes talking about it. She says it’s a lot like the capes that the Scots used to wear. I don’t know what that means. I take her word for it.

There’s other people there doing the same thing, but they’re “greenhouse mates” - we’re not friends, they’re just there and we’re part of the greenhouse community. I occasionally speak to them. I ask them if they’ve ever tried growing this. One of them will comment that yes they have with success, or no they haven’t ever tried that, or they tried it without success. I’m growing an amazingly different number of lettuces and cabbages which look distinctly different from each other. I’ve never seen any other than two strains of cabbage in my waking life. But there’s all kinds of cabbage, some of it is beyond frilly to the point of being downright hairy, but they’re not hairs, they’re actually long and skinny cabbage fibers that grow from the head of the cabbage and you would cut off and eat. This appears to be one of my favorite ones because I’m growing a lot of it. In waking life I don’t eat wheat or gluten. So I’m growing this gluten free bread. You put the seeds in a bowl and it rises and turns into a bread, but it’s really made of vegetable fibers. So in the dream, there’s lots of me growing food and it’s a nice dream. Inside the greenhouse there’s the right amount of moisture. It’s a bit messy, but it’s nice. There’s hydroponics and actual seeds and dirt. Then as I begin to harvest some of the seeds I’ve been growing and put them in containers and compartments, the dream deconstructs into a townhouse that I actually used to live in, in a place called Wellington Square. I’m making tea. So I’m making it out of the things I’ve grown. I’m making apple tea out of apple leaves and actual apples. I pour it into the pot and the water is just the right temperature. I wait and let it steep. I remember it tasted really good, too. There was cinnamon in it. Then I decide to get out my grandmother’s fine china tea sets. I pour from the pot into the tea cups and sit for a minute and think, “Why have (...)",

I’m sitting on the grass in the front lawn and I see a person but it’s not clearly identified features. I’m just somehow in my dream saying it’s a man. The man is running and shouting angrily. I feel threatened so I start to back up. The person runs into my neighbor’s house on the right. I can’t go in my own house because I'm not safe there so I sneak around the side of my house and am hiding in the backyard. I hear screaming and yelling and commotion. The man comes out of my neighbor’s house and starts coming back up towards my house and goes in - nothing happens because no one’s in there - and comes out. I realize that he is sneaking or stalking around the perimeter of my own house. So I avoid him but he’s not far behind and I don’t know where to go that’s safe. I notice that my other neighbor’s side door is open a little bit and I’m feeling kind of bad about going into the house without knocking, but if I don’t run in and close the door and lock it, then that thing will get me. So I run in, close the door and lock it and the lady that owns the house looks at me and says, “Oh! What are you doing in here?” I say, “Quick! Lock the front door! There’s an angry person!” (but I don’t call it that in the dream. I’ve given it a name and the name escapes me). I warn her, so she does and we listen and it’s yelling angrily and pounding at the door and trying to get in, but it doesn’t. But while it’s trying, I tell her that it’s been chasing me for ages and I’m really sorry for invading your privacy, but I needed to come in here or it would kill me. She says that’s okay, it’s alright. She calmly looks at me and says, “Freya, what have you been doing? I never see you anymore.” So she’s talking to me and she’s kind of oblivious that this thing is out there. And then our small talk finishes. It’s quiet. It’s been quiet. I hov (...)",

So I decide to go over and see if I can find one of the neighbors. One of them is a guy in his late twenties. He’s sitting in a makeshift house, like a playhouse for kids, really simple with just cutouts for doors and windows and nothing else really.

My husband and I have rented a massage room upstairs and we’re trying to get out of the lease because it feels sinister. While I’m there, the reformers come. They are young men, probably in their twenties. They’ve been reformed themselves and have grown up in this system. They’re there to separate out the children and choose the ones who will be reformed. They separate them into red groups and orange groups. I think that it would be best for them to choose the ones who are already complacent and will go along with everything. But I notice that the young men are ones that I recognize from earlier in my life - I saw them at Esalen and they were really carefree spirits. So the children that they are not the complacent quiet well behaved ones, but of course the ones that are the most wild, free and expressive - the ones that have a sense of themselves from the very beginning, kind of like my son... One of those colors will be the group that will be reformed this time around. All of the little ones that will be taken away are on a bus and my husband is on the bus. He wants to take a ride down the hill to the gate. He encourages me and our son to get on the bus, too. I don’t feel great about it, but I get on the bus. The headmistress steps onto the bus, too.

I know that I can’t save the children that have already been chosen but I need to get out for myself and my son. They won’t stop the bus. So I push my way to the front doors of the bus and push the doors open. I’m holding my son and I look down at the ground, jump out and tumble to the ground. My son and I are safe. I don’t know what will happen to my husband, but I have a feeling he’ll be fine.",

We’re standing in the kid’s bedroom. It has a really low ceiling and it’s very dark in there. I see that there’s two sets of bunk beds and two regular beds in this bedroom and I don’t care if he takes them. There’s so many and he can take all of them. The kids and I would figure out some sort of way for them to have sleeping arrangements. I just want to get away from him because it feels like he keeps trying to mark his territory and take and control and dominate. I’m just tired of it. I walk out into the living room and I see that my godmother is standing there and my auntie. I explain to her that I’m tired of all of this. The kitchen is behind her and the refrigerator is there and an old piece of furniture that we used to have in my childhood home that was a bar is in between the two of us. I’m noticing that. Time has gone backwards. I’m now in a younger version of the house that I grew up in. I’m still a mother. I still have two children. They’re still with me. And my godmother says let’s just go. All of a sudden we’re in a car all together, but my ex is there, too, and I just do not want him there. We are driving down the road and I’m starting to get upset because I realize we didn’t pack anything. There’s no food. There’s no water. I don’t have my phone, my wallet, my keys. I don’t have anything. I turn to my godmother and I tell her we need to go back so that we can get some supplies. She asks me if I’m sure. I say, “yes, we don’t have any of the things we need.” She says okay and instead of pulling out into the turnout to the right, she goes a little further down the road to this place where there’s no turnout and where in fact either side of the road is covered in this marshy area.

I don’t think it’s Agrarian either. I get the feeling that it’s again post-apocalyptic, but much further along in the future than the dream when I was standing in a burnt world and started choking and woke up because I was choking. Everyone here, we are wearing ragged bits of eclectic pieces of clothing. There’s no real recognizable city structure. There’s ruined buildings with grass and vegetation growing up, in, around the building. People have settled there and built structures out of other scraps and things. It’s not unpleasant to look at. It has a settled, organized, civilized feel to it. However, there’s agrimony between groups of people who have settled around these places. Part of the group that I am settling with, we know we have to flee or we’re probably going to be killed. So we organize very quickly. We can’t bring all of our stuff. Our stuff is an eclectic variety of things that we use to feed ourselves and clothe ourselves with. Some people have backpacks and these are being dispersed among the group. I’d say there’s probably about 60 or 75 in my group, but for the purpose of traveling and feeding ourselves, we organize ourselves into four groups, so there’s about twelve to fifteen in each group. They are dividing people into groups by skill level, so if you have already shown some survival skill behavior, they don’t put all of those people in one group. They’re separating them so there’s at least one person who’s got some know-how in each group. I’m one of those people who has some survival skills. I’m separated from some of my closer friends because we can’t all travel together and this makes me sad. We also have people in the group who have babies. There’s one woman who’s carrying a baby.

We had burrowed our way through the school closing doors and blocking off access points behind us to make it difficult for anyone to follow us. Our hope was that we could escape without any further bloodshed.  We could at first hear people following us from around us and above but eventually those noises died down and we thought we were safe.  We did some kind of scanning to figure out where people were as we traveled through the underground tunnels. We came out into a more open area not too far from an exit which would allow us to escape to the surface.  We heard noises or sensed vibrations and when I put my head to the ground I could hear voices below us. The military was tunneling up to attack us. I came up with a plan. We'd either go for the exit or return the way we came, and we'd use printers (not sure how these were relevant) to pour molten lead down onto the military if they tried to surface. The whole time though, I didn't want to do anything to kill. We were only trying to escape and to avoid conflict. I don't believe we were an especially violent group.",

There’s tons of people out - the people who live there, the kids, all the neighbors and also the people who don’t and are milling about as well. The streets feel narrow and crowded. The atmosphere isn’t necessarily celebratory, but it’s not threatening either. I’m curious about all the houses. They’re so different in the way they’re put together and they’re even facing different directions - not lined up like you would usually see them. And now I’m walking through a little playground/play yard. It’s got the small slides for toddlers and bark chips on the ground. As I move through, I’m invited into someone’s house - a woman and one of her children invite me in and I walk into the house and notice that there are bright colors on all the walls and all of the walls are different color. As I’m walking through, I realize it’s one of the houses I remodeled when I was younger. It’s all the colors I had painted the walls in my house. I look at her and ask how did she come into possession of this house. I thought it was something I still owned or I just hadn’t seen it in such a long time that I almost forgot that it was part of my story. She says that she bought it. It had been a rental for a while and she and her family had bought the house. They renovated it a little - they added to it. So she walked around showing me these renovations like real wood paneling on some of the walls that looked absolutely beautiful. The back of the house had been extended out. She leads us into the backyard. I see that the backyard is actually huge. It has a fence around it and there’s still all the people all around. The neighborhood is so crowded. There’s so many people, but this backyard is this one area where it’s just huge and not a lot of people in it, although there’s a fence to keep the people out. There’s a mother-in-law cottage that they’ve built on it, but it’s only half built. It hasn’t been completed. It’s m (...)",

There’s water and electricity on each camp, and huts where they have table tennis and ping pong, a nice shower, the washing machine and dryer and stuff like that. So I’m in the campground in an RV - it’s mine - and I’m sitting in a chair watching the sunset and this really good looking guy comes up and asks if he can join me. So I say yes and he sits down in the chair beside me. We’re talking for a bit and there’s some chemistry. He asks if he could see me again and if I would like to share dinner with him the next night and I say yes. So instantly it’s the next night and he’s brought dinner over. It’s a box of triscuit crackers. I can’t even eat wheat and in the dream I don’t ask if they’re gluten-free, but I look at what he’s brough and think, hmm this was not quite my idea of dinner. I excuse myself and say just a moment. I’ve gone back into my RV to get plates, knives and forks. I put a plate, knife and fork in front of each of us. He pours the crackers onto the plate and he pours two on each plate. I’m thinking to myself, wow, there isn’t even anything to go on top of the crackers. So he cuts his into 4 pieces, each cracker into 4 pieces. He asks me if I would like him to cut my food. He’s being chivalrous and galant about it. I accept his offer, but say I would like mine cut into 5 pieces please. I think this is funny because the triscuits won’t cut nicely into five pieces. They’re breaking and crumbling. He’s trying to cut mine into 5 pieces and I’m giggling under my breath. As he is struggling with this, I have a journal and pen in front of me. I’m writing a song called, “Take Your Crackers and Go.” It’s got song lyrics to rhyme and I think these are terribly clever. I’m using a tune to a popular rock song and am humming along as I do it. In the next part of the dream, the good looking guy is still struggling with the crackers. (...)",

I fell asleep again with the intention of focusing on the music. I was in my bedroom, though it was much different than my current room. It was spacious with wooden floors and a black radio slightly off center on the right side. A country-rock song began to play on the radio and as it did I focused intensely on it and began to dance and sway to the music. I could make out the melody and instruments enough to tell that it was a complete song and that I had not heard it before as far as I could tell.   I could not make out much of the words. The song lasted for about 15 seconds before I woke up.  I drifted back asleep again with the same intention and this time found myself in the kitchen of my parents' house where the radio began to play a slow rock song. This time I could both make out the melody and hear every word. It was not a song that I had heard before but it combined some elements of Tears for Fears, Morten Harket, and something like CCR. I remember a phrase to the effect of: \"We all don't want to hang.\" and followed up by something pertaining to dying or not dying. It wasn't a dark song and the lyrics didn't have any emotional connection.   I wish that I could remember more of the lyrics because in the dream I was focusing on them intently so that I could remember them. I hope to develop this skill to the point where I could remember longer pieces of music.  In this second dream too, I was dancing to the music. I could feel very clearly the rhythmic movement of my body as I swayed like a pendulum to the music. This seemed to help keep the dream going.",

I approached him and in a fatherly tone began to explain to him in a cryptic way such that he would know what I was talking about but not be able to prove that I knew about how wrong some of the things that he had done at STU were.   Then I saw that two more people were approaching: the pastor from CFC and the real D. The person who I had been talking to was only a look-alike and had been very confused by my conversation. I briefly acknowledged Derek's presence and spoke to the pastor. The pastor told me that I would be a member at CFC in a month's time thinking that in this time I would reconsider my beliefs which had stopped me from becoming one previously. In the dream (and now) I thought that this was ridiculous.   I walked past the church and saw a raised brick enclosure where one would have plants or small trees. There were some loose bricks at the base of the enclosure and I could see that inside the hollow space were a family of cats. There was a mother cat with half a dozen kittens. One of the kittens had jumped out and was being friendly toward me, but the mother was not happy about this and made it come back inside. There was a kitten there who was very hurt and unable to breathe well. I could hear its labored breathing. I attempted to help it, but the mother didn't want to let it near me. I eventually won her trust and she let me help her. I made plans to take the kittens to the vet where they could be cured, given shots, and spayed/neutered before finally being returned to their mother.",

He wanted me to get everything ready but didn’t give me any idea as to the timing or numbers or theme. He was “busy” with work and so charming to everyone but wouldn’t tell me anything. This is very much like real life. I woke up feeling so pissed off at him with my heart beating fast. My older sister was there too (in real life she lives in another state across the country, but in the dream she was here). I didn’t learn until the end that some people were going to stay the night after the party and I was supposed to get the rooms ready.",

I’m sitting with a group of friends having a pleasant conversation when someone taps on my shoulder and says, “That woman over there would like to speak with you.” I’m a little annoyed that I’m being interrupted during something social to do something that feels like work. I look over that it’s Claire, a studio owner of someone I used to work with but I’ve parted ways due to her unethical practices. I refuse to go over there and just tell the messenger that I’m busy. I continue talking with my friends, but he’s persistent. He won’t leave me alone. He stalks me everywhere. So I finally go over there just to tell her to piss off. There’s a pile of documents on the table and I see they’re spread out a bit. I see sticking out from one of them, my name. So now I’m sucked into engaging with them because I want to know why my name is on a piece of paper. They should not have anything to do with me - we never signed a contract, though I always wanted to. So there’s nothing that has my signature on it. He sees me glance at it and my arm is reaching to pull it out from the bottom. He swipes it first. He is her representative - at some point he’s told me this or I’ve just assumed it from the conversation, but he’s definitely behaving like it now. So I say, “What is that with my name on it?” He says it’s a contract. I say it can’t be because I’ve never signed anything with Claire here or her studio. He says, “It says here that you release her from any responsibility for any shady interactions or any responsibility for her past actions. “ I’m a little bit outraged and refuse. I say, “I’m not signing anything like that. It’s a lie!” I also don’t think that she should escape accountability for her actions. At this point she speaks and says she’s applying for a new business and she needs all her past employees to sign this contract in order for her to have a pristine business record and move f (...)",

The family that I knew was my friend Margaret and her two kids. Her husband wasn’t there, in fact there was an issue that maybe the husband walked out on them previous to this camp. The other Family was all kiddos the eldest brother my age and the siblings all under 20 and he was basically like the father figure and took care of everyone. He was an old childhood friend of my friend Margaret. There was a vibe that maybe there was something developing between them. We were painting pottery and just talking and a childhood friend of mine came and sat next to me. I knew this friend had died when I was a kid, his name is Niko. I was feeling really sad for my friend Margaret and I asked him how he was since it had been so long since I’ve seen him and asked if he had a message for me to deliver to Margaret. And he said from who and I said her mother who has deceased. He said it was a message of hope that miracles happen when you believe. I didn’t wanna upset her but I told her the message and about my friend Niko and I gave her a deck of tarot cards and said that there are ways to receive messages from our ancestors, we just have to listen and know how to ask. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw my own family sitting at a table - my mom and aunt and cousins and I was not drawn to go sit with them. I went home to my childhood house and I had invited a bunch of people from the camp to come over. I was going to teach them flower arranging. There were two Women there that wanted to make that ordeal much more complicated than it had to be. I said that I could teach flower arranging sitting on the floor, I didn’t need to build an extra table or have all these extra things I just needed the flowers and scissors in an open space  (...)",

The scene changes really suddenly and there’s an impression that a lot of time has passed - weeks, months, perhaps. I’m really confused and don’t know how I’ve gotten to where I am. I feel like I’m waking up or seeing things that are really new and strange for me. My mom is there and she tells me that the car I had been traveling had crashed. My dad had been driving it and the accident was pretty bad. Everything is okay now. My body is fine. There’s nothing wrong with me. It seems so strange that there could have been an accident and I don’t remember it at all. She tells me it was pretty bad. I have no idea if my siblings or dad made it because it’s just me and my mom. The scene changes again and I’m with a bunch of friends from high school and some friends from now. We’re in a basement of a building. It has a huge storage unit and has all kinds of things in it from older times but also feels like a theatre costume room. We’re searching for a very specific item for one of my friends. As we go through all this stuff, it seems kind of weird - all these random bits of fabric and buttons. But we’re not finding what we’re looking for. Then the scene changes again. I’m on a soccer field and I’m really wanting to play, but I have these white shoes I need to put on and it’s taking me forever to put the shoes on and the laces are really long. My friend who is also a masseuse is there as well. He’s playing soccer and he’s playing really well. I want to go and play, but I also feel like maybe I’m not good enough and maybe that’s why it’s taking me so long to put my shoes on. Although he does keep trying to pass me the ball, but I’m still on the sidelines. It’s almost like I’m not allowed to be on the team. It’s a full size field and a full size ball, then it suddenly switches to a very small room. We’re all still trying to fit in and pl (...)",

The police showed up and attempted to stop him, but he refused and continued to dodge in and out of the group of officers. Once, one of the officers grappled him to the ground, but he managed to slip away.   I was annoyed that he would be so disrespectful and unruly and possibly I said something, because Ninja's younger brother came over to me and started harassing me. He would walk up to me and shove me or bump into me. I did nothing at first and was intent on remaining calm. He kept this up long enough though that I had no choice but to retaliate. I planned a specific sequence of moves where I would hit him in the stomach once or twice and them the head and possibly finish with a kick. I don't remember if I had to use these or not or if he ran away when I confronted him.  Ninja's brother had a Mohawk and looked a bit like a guy who was at LP who I only vaguely remember.",

The patio area has these huge columns like the Roman columns you see in ruins. It’s night time. It’s dark out. There’s a lot of people I don’t know at the party, but there’s a lot of my classmates from high school there, too. We’re hanging out but I have this feeling of being the outsider and not really welcomed or not included somehow. I’m watching what’s going on and I’m trying to get the attention of my classmates but I’m awkward about it and I don’t really know how. Then one of my classmates who I’ve known since we were 8 sees me and hangs out together and kinda takes me under his wing. He’s showing me around this party - just the outside perimeter part, we still haven’t gone into any of the building. He’s getting really comfortable with me. His arm is around me and there’s this air of ownership almost. I do not like it. I remember when we were in high school and flashing back to when he was a little more touchy feely than I liked. I’m not excited that he’s doing that, but I also wanted to see everyone. Eventually I peel myself away. Then some sort of time goes by and I’m walking around this party and I realize there’s this point on one side where it was the outside of the party and there’s grass fields and trees. Time is going on normally. But there’s a partition and on the other side of this line, everything has been frozen. The people there are asleep. I realize that if I cross over this line and walk into it, I can see them, I can see that they’re asleep or frozen and I can also bring them out of it. When I do, six years has passed on one side of the line and no time has passed on their side. It’s very odd. They’re still who they were and time has gone on on the other side.

We tried to go another way but there was a large stone gate covered in green moss. I told them to go ahead without me. Then, it was dark and I was in a city (maybe San Francisco) and trying to find my way home. I found a dog and tried to return it to this house and it was a dog rescue. They asked if I wanted cats, too. I am allergic but said I would meet them. They tried to get me to take three cats and I remember feeling scared that they weren’t declawed (in real life I don’t know enough about it but my sister has a cat and thinks declawing isn’t humane). In the dream there was a dog who came with us and we left the cats. I kept thinking about my ex’s dogs because I consider them mine and wondering if they would get along. I kept doing the math that it would be three dogs total (but it would be four). This dog was about 30-40 pounds with reddish golden hair like one of the goldens, Chuck. He came home with me and my dog Pinto. In my building we are only supposed to have one dog so I was worried about being caught, but knew my dog Pinto would be happier and wouldn’t howl when I left (he’s been doing that lately) because now he would have a friend. At the end of this dream we stopped at a Mexican restaurant and I couldn’t find the door in. Then I got a seat and had to get up to find the bathroom, but then woke up.",

It’s set up like a garage sale - the garage is open, there’s all kinds of stuff, tables going down the driveway and all kinds of eclectic assortment of things for sale. Then there’s some other bigger things like bicycles and whatnot and some furniture and other freestanding items. It’s dense with material items as well as a traffic of people going back and forth. This is not my house. This is my friend’s house. He’s currently playing his old drum set at the back of the garage. He’s facing out so he can see who comes and goes and be of assistance if someone asks a question. I’m just hanging out there chatting casually with him. One of the women that comes up is an attractive brunette and she’s wearing a mini skirt. I notice that her body is very svelte like she works out and I notice this and think, wow she’s really attractive. She starts asking my friend about some item that she’s interested in. As he is answering her, she turns around so her back is to him, and she bends over to pick something up. Then this explosion comes out of her butt and the whole garage is sprayed with shit! It’s all over everything. I’m incredulous. I’m astonished that she’s done this and she just stands up and acts like nothing’s happened. She doesn’t apologize and she just walks away. My friend has got some of this on him and instead of cleaning himself up, he goes over and starts wiping up the stuff that is on the floor around the yard sale items without seeming to notice that he’s got some of it on him and he needs to go wash his face. I’m just really disgusted. For some reason I’m mute. I’m not saying anything, but I’m in horror. Then the dream shifts from that scene. I’m in another friend’s house. She’s a person I know in real life, she’s a substitute mom to me. I’m in her house and I’m upstairs. I’m helping sort something out.

I can hear the ocean rolling in, the waves are not to be big and I’m listening to the all actors say their lines. There’s about five of them sitting around in chairs doing their scenes and one of the actors is Henry Cavill - the guy who plays Superman. I’m a little bit starstruck and awestruck, but I’m staying out of the way just watching him. I have no idea why I’m there. So I watch them for a little bit and he takes a while to come out onto the set to do his lines, but then he leaves. I have definitely got an eye on him - just watching everything he does.

The beach setting has changed to an outdoor weight room setting with weight machines. It’s like we’re playing musical chairs but we’re doing it with the weight machines and we all keep going from one to the next. Somehow I’m part of the crew even though it’s all the actors now and we take turns doing our sets and then we all rotate one and get moved to the next machines.

So, we actually have our swimming stuff and a change of clothes with us because the reason my son and I are at the mall is because we are picking up a few things for a picnic because we’re about to go swimming. So we do this - we pick up some things in a store and I pack them in a drawstring bag and we get into our car. It is really, really, really hot and I’m thirsty. We drive a little bit to the place where there’s swimming - it’s a man made thing. I get out of the car and I open the backdoor and realize that there’s no water. I always have water. I don’t even buy other things to drink, I just bring water. I look in the back with the picnic stuff and there’s cans - and I don’t even buy anything in cans - of something called Crush. There’s a rootbeer one and an orange flavor and a grape flavor. I say to my son, “Oh no, look! This is all we have to drink and I’m so thirsty!” He takes the orange one so I pick up the rootbeer one and I open it up and I lift it up like the way Popeye takes spinach where you can see the stream of spinach go from the can into his mouth and I’m pouring the rootbeer into my mouth. I’m simultaneously disgusted by this sugary gooky dark color and I’m surprised that this is actually quenching my thirst. I down the whole thing and then it’s gone but I’m still thirsty.

I didn’t know that.” And then I’m worried because my son has one, so I look for him. He’s already finished his and he looks fine - he’s not acting like there’s been any alcohol and I’m not feeling like there’s been any alcohol, so I suspect what the stranger has said to me is incorrect.

It’s long and narrow, although the rooms are plenty big enough - they’re just longer than they are wide. There're houses in New Orleans called shotgun houses because they’re long like that and the entrance to all the rooms are off the hallway, so if you’re driving by and shooting a gun, you could shoot a bullet in the front door and it goes all the way through the house and out the backdoor. So I guess it’s a shotgun house. We’re in the very back room of this house, which is my bedroom. We’re having a house discussion, so all the people that live there are having a conversation about pets. We have lots and I love pets. But one of them has a cow and I don’t want it lying on my bed because it runs around outside and in the backyard, too, where there’s poops lying around on the grass, so it’s got poops on its feet or it could have at any given time. I don’t want that on my bed. So I’m saying, “Animals, if they can be trained to stay on the floor, then that’s fine, they’re allowed in my room. But if they’re up on my bed, then I won’t also allow them in my room.” The cow is in the room while we’re saying this. As I’m talking, it’s doing this sad eyes and pouty mouth. First it puts its head in my lap and looks sad, then it rolls a little bit at a time, like a toddler does when they’re limp and you’re trying to get them to walk and they just turn into a blob. It’s doing this. Then it’s on the bed. So I push it off and it’s heavy - it’s got a great big belly and it’s bigger than I am and it’s head is the size of my torso. But I push it back onto the floor and it looks at me mournfully. But I’m saying, “No, get off my bed.” But the people I’m having this discussion with don’t even hear me. And they say, “Okay, so it’s alright if the cow is on your bed as long as your bed is made and the quilt is on.” I say, “No! I just finished saying, not on my bed under any circumstances!” T (...)",

I look up and I see across the way, two women heading my direction. One is tall and dark hair, pale skin. The other one is shorter with lighter skin and blonde hair. I recognize the tall dark one, she is a friend of mine, or we were friends but it ended strangely and abruptly and I still have feelings of sadness, frustration and hurt around it. So, I see them strolling through this open marketplace and pretend not to see them - I put my face down and go back to work and put my hand up over my face. However, they stop right in front of my table anyway and when I look up, the tall dark-haired one says hello and seems to be very happy to see me. I’m a little bit cautious and wary and say hello and ask how they are and what do they want? nicely but I don’t feel particularly warm towards them. However, they persist and the tall dark-haired one invites me to go with them just to continue wandering around outside. It is such a nice day. I actually say okay. Part of me is warming up to her, but part of me still wants to say, hey you ghosted me, why are you even talking to me now? We start wandering through the marketplace and we go into shops and out of shops. I think we both already had our coffee or beverages, but we wander around getting gelato and some other things. At one point, she hands me a ring. I look at the ring, it’s very simple, I think there’s just a couple of stones in it, and I don’t remember what the stones are. It fits on my finger, which is rare because I have larger fingers. It’s lovely and I love rings, so I wear the ring. We continue to walk around and at what point we walk past this group of my other high school friends who are out on a lawn doing a bootcamp style workout. I introduced my taller friend and my shorter friend to the friends of mine who are doing this bootcamp. For whatever  (...)",

    "text": "“Community” There’s a lot of mundane stuff that I won’t bother sharing. The dream setting is in a house. I’m back in the small town I lived in when I went to high school. There are at least fifty people in the dream and they’re all people I know. One is my ex-best friend. Part of my psyche recognizes her - she’s in the same house as everyone else - and my dream psyche says to my non-dream psyche, “Oh you’re not triggered that you see her.” And my non-dream psyche answers back, “No, hmm, I’m not.” But I still had some distance from her and in the dream we’re not friends. The setting: The house is in the town I grew up in and it’s full of people. I do know all of them. I go from room to room. We’re having casual conversations. It’s a potluck, so these conversations are over food. There’s catch up time. One guy is sitting by himself in the living room. He’s wearing a tuxedo without the jacket and he’s pulled the bib part of it over his face and he’s just sitting there so no one can talk to him, but we all know who it is, so it’s odd. I realize as I’m conversing and connecting with these people - I still keep in touch with a lot of these people, but I left that town because I couldn’t stand living there - one of the things I’ve missed is the sense of community. Aside from it being a potluck, there are renovations going on in the house. The house belongs to one of my friends. The backyard also has a large barn in it that’s empty. The place may have been a farm once, but the farmland would have been sold off. So there’s just a large backyard now with a barn in it. So he’s gathered all these people together. We’ve all brought our own food. He’s describing what he wants the finished product to look like. Everybody is offering something of their service - one of the skills they're good at. The purpose of the potluck is to make a decision as a community of who’s going to do what. And then the other thing that goes along with it is that the property’s big and all the people th (...)",

When we get there, we’re given the book that we are to select a song from and there’s someone else sitting with us that knows us, but I have no idea who it is - I don’t know them in real life, I don’t know them in dream life, they don’t say anything, they just sit there, but they carry the energy of a male that we know. My son passes me the song book and I look at it. I turn through every single page and I don’t know any of the songs. They’re all classical and I don't have a classical guitar, I have an acoustic guitar with me. My son indicates the song that we should play and it’s really really complicated. I start trying to practice it and of course my guitar is out of tune. It’s almost impossible to tune because there’s so much noise in this place. When there’s not noise, somebody else is on the stage playing so I can’t be tuning my guitar. They call numbers, like a lottery, for who plays next, so I never know if we’re going to be the next one to play and we’re unprepared. I ask my son if he’s ever sang this song before and he says no, he doesn’t even know the tune. I’m starting to get really anxious. I start walking around to see who else is there. I see another couple - I do know them in real life. They have prepared a piece as well. I just express: “Oh wow, I didn’t realize you played classical guitar” One of the couple says that she does - she’s been playing it since she was a kid. She pulls off a few riffs and I’m like, “Wow you’re so good!” Then I keep walking around and there’s no one on the stage for some time. So I walk up the stage and go off on stage left and there’s an office and my teacher from grade 4 is in there. I go in and talk to him for a little bit. Interesting that he also plays guitar - he played guitar for us every day in grade 4 in real life, and I suspect in my dream I may have brought him in because I need some  (...)",

    "text": "“Forgiveness” In my dream I’m at the studio I’m trying to leave because of their lack of integrity and their manipulative behavior. There’s people - it’s almost like something has happened in the outside world and there’s refugees, just people that are lying in cots, like hospital bed cot in the studio. The studio is full of people. They’re not practicing yoga or anything - well, not in the physical sense, but they are in the spiritual sense. People are nursing other people. I’m not even sure what the wounds are because they’re not really obvious. But some people are not able to get up off the cot and other people are. So the “nursing” seems to be more on a spiritual level. So I’m involved with this and I’m just circulating among the people, soothing, easing, doing what I can. At one point somebody needs something, so like in dreamtime consciousness, the studio is all of a sudden larger than it actually is in real life. Hallways appear and I’m going down these hallways into empty offices that have been abandoned and looking for supplies. There’s a bit of an adventure where I don’t meet anyone, I’m just going down this labyrinth of hallways and checking to see if I can find things that will help other people and then bringing them back in, leaving them with someone else who will take care of the person while I go off and then hunt down something else that might be of use to someone else. After one of these trips, the person who seems to have the most issues - none of them are visual, I can’t see them bandaging bleeding wounds or anything, it’s just trying to get this person things so that they are able to have mobility again and get up off the cot. So this is where I’m entering into the busy studio atmosphere again where I see the owner - the one who has been manipulative and lied. She’s tending to this person and she has a completely different approach to what mine has been - she’s changed the approach of treatment so that all the things I have gathered, she’s now s (...)",

    "text": "This dream is remembered in fragments. It’s a little disconnected in my memory. In one part, a group of us has set up a puja to Ganesh and the puja is set up outside of the temple because that’s where we’re supposed to do this particular service or worship. However, somebody has decided instead to take down this ceremony and move it to the inside of the temple and use the altar pieces, especially the altar cloth, that are meant for worship of Nataraj. To me it feels sacrilegious. There are people that live and work in the temple that are really not happy with this disrespect. The person who’s leading it doesn’t seem to really have any awareness of culture or tradition. Then there’s a girl next to this person who’s in charge of the ceremony and she’s wearing all white. This, too, is not correct. People are looking back and forth at each other commenting on it, and then she sort of stumbles over her words. So her mother, a few people down, tells her to have everybody turn around to face outside of the circle and take their pants off because it would be easier if they did that - easier for her to remember her words. So she tells everyone to do this and they do. I am looking at this nun and she’s a Buddhist nun and she’s really delightful. She has short hair and robes. I can see her face because it’s reflected in a mirror and she’s making all these delightful expressions - looking at people around her, lifting up her eyebrows and opening up her mouth in a big happy smile, then going back into a serious face. She seems a little bit odd to me. Then suddenly the scene shifts. She’s still there, but she’s the size of a fairy or gnome and she’s standing in the grass. She’s still making these delightful expressions. There’s another small person with her. Then, somebody finds a journal and it’s my journal. The last entry is from December 31, 2019. I start to fill it in. I write the date next to it, January 1, 2020. I can’t remember exactly what happened, but I’m trying to fill (...)",

There's orcas there. You don't see them, but periodically, you don't see a big sea mammal exhalation, but more substantial venting of steam, not forceful, just a bit of directionality to them, here and there. I never actually saw one, and at first I wasn't sure what they were. Then I'm talking to some guy in a pickup. He verifies that they're orcas. I start asking him questions, but he doesn't know. Because I'm fascinated. I want to know, how isolated is this population. I think of my experiences in Alaska in my late teens. I'm supposed to rendezvous with Baker. There's a dilapidated mall somewhere around Mt. Vernon, that we are to meet at. I've forgotten I was to meet her, but I'm there, and she comes walking out, and I give her a big hug. Before I meet her, I'm in some store, which seems rather odd. And I walk around the mall some. There' some young men. I'm super aware of their sexuality, their genitals. They're very appropriately clothed, but I feel it, which causes cogitation on our animal bodies. Yes we have minds, language, and tools, but.... Earlier, I was sitting talking to some guys, then lying down in the grass with them. Warm and summery. Before I met Baker I was in this very junky shop, quite large with very high ceilings, then went out and met Baker, and we go into some other part of the mall, and then she isn't there any more. That's when I have the mediations on sexuality. Very sunny. Something about my car, where is it?",

I have two other work engagements and I’m not as excited about either of those, but I know it’s time for me to move to my second job, so I leave this light and bright place.

She’s a mother and she has these two boys that aren’t hers but they’re in her care somehow. She also has a baby with her and at one point the baby is needing care and she has a fish she’s caught. The fish needs to be filleted and cooked and somehow I’m the one who knows how to do that. So I fillet the fish and I can see the individual muscles - the layers - the way a fish fillet is layered. The baby seems to be sickly and crying and is sitting in a carrier to my right. I fillet this fish and cook it and then take one of the layers off and give it to the baby to eat. This baby seems to be 5 or 6 months old, so it seems kind of strange that I’m giving it fish, but it seems to be what it needs. There’s this overall air of sadness and grief, like this baby is going to die anyway even if I give it this nourishing fish.

As I stared at the map though, I was visually transported to an areal view of each camping location and was pointing out different landmarks, houses, and features which made contributed to the quality of each place.  Eventually, we identified a place which was perfect and decided to camp there. It had something to do with the hilly/mountainous terrain and possible the location or distance of nearby houses.   I remember that we hiked to the top of one of the mountains at night, but this time with my brother William and our mother. When we got to the top, we looked out at a large lake with a city on the other side. It was a beautiful view but something about it was off.

We’re driving over the little bridge that used to grow across the stream - we called it the Y because the road splits into a Y right here. But the road was gone. It's just grass, then the stream and the road starts a little further ahead. I somehow manage to go fast enough to jump the little gap of stream and make it back onto the road. As I'm heading up I see that there’s a race or something going on and they actually have a place to just turn around. It seems like a lot of other cars have driven up this way, then realized they couldn’t continue. So we drive up to there and I turn around, but something about it feels uncomfortable like I should’ve known there was a race happening today or something. As I drive back and realize I have to go back over that little part of the stream where there’s no road, I’m getting worried because the gap seems much wider now and I don’t know if the van can make it across that gap. So I stop and get out and look. There’s a man sitting in a chair next to the road near the stream. He says, “You just have to go fast. You’ve got it.” But now somehow the van has turned into a bike maybe. I’m really nervous about jumping this gap, but I back up and do it anyway. It works, except when I land on the other side I notice my phone is gone and I can’t find it. The man in the chair says, “Oh it’s in the water.” Now I’m panicked because phones and water don't mix. But I pull it out of the water and it still seems to work, which makes me feel relieved. I take it, put it in my pocket, and instead of going home down the Y, we take the other path. It leads to a restaurant of sorts and we’re hungry and whoever’s with me wants to eat. We get to this restaurant and one of my highschool friends is there.

Someone dressed in red was there, and I think that it was a woman who had been killed by the murderer. As I was inspecting the crime scene, a police officer approached me and began questioning me as if I might be the murder. It was clear that I was one of their main suspects.  I left and planned to return to my house, but I realized that someone was after me and was going to prevent me from using my super power liquid which I had in a giant vat in my house.

I remember going up to the second floor of the complex where my house or apartment was and entered my living room. It was dingy and filled with a yellowish light with a giant metal vat filled with bluish liquid. I had to enter this to gain my powers, but for some reason it wasn't working and I had to go out across the road to an abandoned lot where my other vat or portal was which gave me powers.  I jumped out of the window and landed lightly on the ground without injuring myself as I still had exceptional strength as a super hero. I was still being chased, so as I approached the second vat/portal, I grabbed a large stone, probably weighing 300lb and threw it at my pursuers to block off their path to me. This would not have worked as I don't remember being in a tight space, but for the purposes of the dream, it was effective.  I jumped through the portal or into the vat and found myself swimming through an ocean. The water was blue and I slowly rose to the surface. When I did I began swimming using the breast stroke and I noticed that I my hands in front of me were translucent. I could barely see them and could see the water behind them. I realized that I was dreaming at some level, and as I looked down I saw a  (...)",

We asked for rooms, possibly to sleep with prostitutes, but they were out of one or the other so Jared and I ended up staying in the same room by ourselves. We then made the decision that since there was no one else around, that one of us would have to pretend to be female so that the other could either have sex with them or just sleep lying next to/against them. I think the latter is the case. In any case, I had either chose or was designated to be the female, lay down in the same bed as Jared, and allowed him to hug me from behind.   At some point, I think that we realized that this was just incredibly awkward for both of us and that it was never going to work so we discontinued.",

    "text": "I go to get an entrainment from John Amaral (an entrainment is a Network chiropractic adjustment). The room is so full, but the frontdesk person allows me to go in with my son and there’s a table available for me right there. It’s super crowded, but I lay down and he comes over to me soon. He gives me this wild entrainment. I feel my body levitating off the table, twisting and shifting and moving in an awesome way and it feels amazing - the best experience I’ve ever had on the chiropractic table. I get up and I walk around and then his shift is over. So people start leaving and I wait because I want to thank him. So I wait to talk to him. We walk out together. I ask him how many tables he had set up. 10? No, 30! Then I try to find the frontdesk again to pay and it’s a little difficult to find, but I do. When I get there, I don’t have cash and I can’t seem to find my credit card, so there’s a moment when I’m wondering how I’m going to do this. Somehow it resolves and I’ll be on an honor system and pay them when I can - when I remember my card or can go back and get cash. Then I step outside and I see a huge eagle flying in the sky. Then the eagle spreads its wings really wide and starts to fly backwards with its spine perpendicular to the Earth. Then the eagle lands on a stage-like platform and seems to stand with its wings spread. He starts to do this ritual towards the sun, where he’s taking some of his feathers off and laying them on the ground in this ritual dance. I see there are two other eagles standing in formation with the first one. They’re all standing with their wings fully stretched out. It’s awe-inspiring.",

There was a bathroom at the top of the stairs, and they'd changed the medicine cabinet out and screwed a mirror into the wall in place of it, all very haphazardly. All of my toiletries, and also, presumably, those of other people, were gone. A female director who I tracked down and told about it, at one point she's coming back from somewhere, and I hit her with it as soon as she comes through the door. Then I felt a little bad as it's really kind of trivial, although perhaps not. She says the appropriate things, but I never get my stuff back. Also couldn't find my suitcase? At the Institute, and many tomatoes there, growing along the eaves, above some ledge. I had to look up to see them. I was astonished to see them, as it was so early in the season. I thought how can that be? It's so early in the season. I want to talk to that gardener! Somehow in this, or perhaps a separate dream. I'd neglected my garden, and when I thought to look at it, there was an incredible abundance of unharvested fruit, tomatoes especially, were loaded with big, softball sized fruit. Hundreds of them.

So we’re ready to have yet another meal and I just to start throw out a tantrum essentially and say no. There's a box of mac and cheese on the counter and I pick it up and slam it down in front of the men who are just sitting around the table. I tell them to make their own dinner. I’m feeling not just mad but also guilty for not wanting to make the meal or contribute, but my dad picks up the mac and cheese, then he goes to the fridge and looks at all the leftovers. He starts making a meal which he is perfectly capable of and actually very good at. But I’m still feeling angry and frustrated that it took me blowing up at everyone for someone else to make the meal. Then the scene changes and I’m in a crowd. We’re indoor/outdoor. The dreamscape is like we’re in a restaurant then at a theatre but then outside. I keep moving through places, but I’m watching this group of people. There’s about 9 of them and they’re entertaining. They’re split into two groups because one is going to do a song and then the other group is doing a song. Actually there’s three groups because there’s a third that’s directing and narrating this performance. So the narrators are speaking and the groups are getting ready to sing. The group that’s supposed to sing first is in the wrong position - the wrong spot on the stage.

I have taken off my adornments and placed them at the top of the mat and they’re almost in Ursula's in space, so she gives me this look and so I in a really apologetic way move them over to the side and hide away in a bit of shame for that. Again I’m not able to stand in my true power and be myself in her presence. There's a direction from somewhere, someone telling us to remove our clothes. We are all wearing these beautiful silk flowing gowns. Nobody moves at first. It’s an odd direction and we don’t know where it’s coming from. Then Ursula who is across from me on a mat steps forward in this really seductive way starts to slip off her dress. Two women on either side who are studying with her are her attendants and they help her remove her gown and all of her underthings. Then everyone else proceeds to do so. I feel like, oh gosh I have to also and so I remove my outer gown, but I keep on my underwear because I haven’t waxed and I’m feeling pretty shameful about that. So I’m left wearing a black thong. Then I’m in a room and one of my husband’s friends is lying on a couch. He’s 7 feet tall - a really big guy - and he’s kind of joking around. He says something that agitates me. I climb up onto him and start to pound on him in a playful way. And I say, “You know I never really do this with anybody else, but you’re so big and it just seems okay to do this.” He’s laughing and he thinks it’s a funny thing, too.

We have a covered wagon that we’re getting ready to travel with. It’s a long journey and rather perilous on the one hand, and on the other hand, there’s still modern things available to us. In the dream I go through the whole journey but I can only remember the ending part where we have gone everywhere we need to go and are sitting at a kitchen table trying to weigh out sliced oranges and green beans to feed another child and the scale won’t work. One of my priestess sisters is on a couch behind me and she’s getting scolded by someone for saying that she wants to do a certain thing but then not doing it. She kept saying that she wanted to wear bright orange and red colors, but she doesn’t do it. In the dream, I feel like it is a metaphor for her expressing some part of herself or turning on some part of her magic that she knows she wants but she just doesn’t. I’m listening to the whole thing in a kitchen - it’s a kitchen that’s been part of the journey. I’m worrying that the person that’s scolding her is going to come scold me. The person scolding her sounds like James Earl Jones, he’s like a big black man with a lot of gravitas and authority and power. I’m nervous he’s going to come over and start telling me what I'm not doing right. Then the scene changes. We’re back on the covered wagon again and heading home, back to where we started from. We get there and there’s a huge barn (it reminds me of a barn raising, but the barn has already been built). Everyone’s getting ready to dance. It’s a weird mix of olden times where the women are wearing white caps on their heads and have these long full skirts and then some of them aren’t - some of them are dressed in club clothes, like they are going to a rave.

It's also possible that we were leaving to go on vacation from her house. We were packing a UPS truck filled with our belongings that we were going to take on the trip. I wasn't taking much, and was helping to push shopping carts out to the truck to help load it. I loaded up two carts, stock them together so that I could move them both at the same time, and began to wheel them toward the front door. William was in one of the carts, but he was much younger than he is today. He was only 5 or 6. I noticed that I was much stronger than normal as I made my way to the edge of the front door.

I left the carts near the UPS truck and went back inside. When I went back out to the truck, I found that there was a cop inspecting it. He was inside of the truck and looking around. I thought that this was unusual and that he should have gotten permission before entering the vehicle but it wasn't mine so I didn't say anything. I went to the driver's side door and saw that on the ground, a notice from the insurance company had fallen off. It had information about who rented the truck and was something legally required to be attached to the driver's side door. I assumed that the cop hadn't seen it and that's why he was inspecting. I silently reaffixed it to the door, said nothing to the cop, and left assuming he'd figure it out.",

    "text": "“The Wall” The second dream, I’m in the home of the people I lived in when I was in Grade 10 and 11. I’m in their basement. There were four kids in that family and one of them is my ex-best friend. The kids are hiding things from the parents. They go through this process of scurrying around and putting away stuff they’ve been using so that when the mom comes downstairs she won’t be aware of what they’ve actually been doing. I’m feeling uncomfortable with all of this and with some of the things they’re hiding, I’m thinking, “Why are you even hiding that? It’s just a book.” I didn’t understand the process of hiding, but it seems to be an integrative activity among the kids in the family. Then the dream shifts to a decade later. I’m still a teenager in it, though, and I’ve moved out of their house but I’ve gone back for a visit. There’s the daughter who is my ex-best friend. She has removed a piece of paneling from the wall and there’s stuff in it. I notice her going through it. I’m looking at what she’s brought out. I see a couple things and I’m like, “Oh! That was mine! I don’t remember hiding that and I didn’t even notice I was missing it.” So in the dream, we’re still not talking to each other and I go pick out my things that are in it. She takes her things away somewhere and she just kind of disappears. Then I don’t know what to do with mine. I guess I don’t have any pockets. I can’t seem to think in the dream, “Oh why don’t I just take them with me?” Now I’m encumbered with the idea that the mom can’t see it and I’ve come here to visit her. So I put them back in the wall and put the paneling over top of it. The mom comes downstairs and we have a visit. Then my ex-best friend reappears and she says, “Mom, Freya’s been hiding things in the wall.” Then the mom comes over and removes the piece of paneling and sees that and she’s really disappointed in me that I’ve hidden some things and meanwhile, my ex-best friend has already removed hers and completely set me up.

Everyone was lined up against a white cinder block wall and I told them to split up with boys on the left and girls on the right. I began to question whether this was a politically correct move to make, and all of a sudden, I was looking at a mental picture of little Anime-like male and female figures as they reorganized themselves against a blank white background. But there was at least one student who was transgender and looked neither male nor female and was flitting between one side and the other unsure of where to go.  I then picked a different system using tiles on the wall above the students. It was split from left to right with each side having 2 tiles vertically and 5 tiles horizontally. Each one had a picture of a student on it.  One of the students, I believe a female black student with long hair was being rebellious and not taking her place or moving to and fro within her apace. I spoke with another teacher about how to handler her and I think we were able to resolve the problem peaceably.",

As I passed them, I could hear that they were talking about me. When I came to the elementary school, I saw that they had more kids than usual and needed help. I wasn't sure if I was really qualified to help, but I ended up offering and they needed me, so I was assigned to watch over some kids, maybe 5 or 6 years old, who were playing in a fenced in area during recess. One of them tossed a ball over the fence on a section where the fence was mostly collapsed to the point where a kid could have easily gotten out and where I could have reached through to get the ball. I wasn't sure if I should jump over the fence and grab the ball, as this would set a bad example for the kids who needed to not go across the fence. I tried to reach through and my fingers scraped the ball but I only pushed it further away.   I can't remember for sure, but I may have retrieved the ball and then thrown it out myself and then decided whether or not to jump the fence.",

The track also turned frequently so that one would be constantly hitting up against the wooden rails on the sides of the track.   As I spun around, faster, and faster, it was clear that I had more experience than Harold at doing this as he was falling behind.  To our right, there was an old man with a white beard who was running the ride. We may have wanted him to stop the ride.",

I frequently dream where I’m in settings with some kind of academic flavor to them and they’re set near the water (that’s me being the academic bookwork that I am and also the ocean, lake loving Cancer/Scorpio combination that I am). Here we are in some kind of academic building. It’s packed, there’s lots of people around. I hang out mostly with these two guys. One of them I'm going to call J.C. and the other one I’m going to call him Brandon. They’re always in the vicinity of me, so we have lots of conversations. I think the conversations are platonic because they don’t hold any other kind of frequency for me. We talk a lot about politics and whatever is going on in the school in terms of administration and we analyze a lot of things, or we just have friendly banter. I also eat with them during breaks. So it’s not unusual for me to be asked to eat outside. So this one day, J.C. asks me if I want to take my lunch outside and I say, “Yeah sure, that would be great.” So we bring our lunches with us. We go down and sit on a bench by the lake. There's this large family of some kind of Asian culture because the language they’re speaking is unfamiliar and I think it sounds like it’s some kind of Asian dialect. Then I realize we are the only two people not speaking some other kind of dialect. I start to voice this to him and he’s looking at a baby who’s sitting. One of the parents has sat the baby wearing just a cloth diaper in two inches of water further up on the beach. There’s some beautifully colored shells that the baby is playing with and he’s just watching the baby. I go up and kneel on the sand by the baby and just feel the water around my legs and feet. I still remember the air smelled so good and so fresh. I’m just watching the baby, as well. Then lunch is over, so he reaches down to help me up because I’ve been kneeling.

In my dream, I do not go in the house. The dream occurs outside the house. Imagine standing on the front porch of that house looking forward and you’re surrounded by an arc of tables. The middle of the arc extends outwards from the house and the two ends wrap around the outside to where the beam for the house would be. The tables are eclectic - there’s all different kinds and shapes that create this arc. I am involved with arranging things on the tables. Each table tells its own story and so do the objects on it. The dream begins where I’ve already set up and created the stories on all tables except this one that I am struggling with to bring into the arc so that it doesn’t stick out in some unseemly way from the general shape the tables are creating together. I’m a little frazzled because I can’t get the table to move. It’s stuck somehow. I’m also under some kind of time crunch where I need to meet with someone else, a friend, A.T. We are to go to this other ceremony that’s a type of reunion. So it’s time to go and I have to leave the table where it is, standing off like an unabsorbed cell.

The ceremony is some kind of presentation of some kind of award, but I never pay attention to it because my interactions are on the outside of that.

I’m al ittle panicked because I don’t want to be sprayed. So I start walking away slowly so as not to startle it, but definitely to get away, and the skunk follows me. It’s interesting, instead of a white stripe on top of the skunk’s head, the white is in the shape of a heart. It keeps following me. I’m trying very calmly to get away from it, but it’s acting like a dog and really just wants my attention. So I slow down and let it sniff me, again trying not to move too quickly so it doesn’t spray me. I figure it’s done and begin to walk away. Again it follows me and goes up on its hind legs and puts its front legs on my leg like a dog would do just saying hi. Despite myself, I’m becoming quite fond of this skunk who seems to want my attention with the heart-shaped stripe on its head. But I’m still super concerned it’s going to spray on me. I actually see it lift its leg and I’m worried that it has and I just haven’t smelt it yet, but whether or not the skunk has sprayed I don't know because I can’t smell anything. The animal is just hanging around. I move on. I go to do some other thing, figuring it will follow me or not, and it does. It wanders off and goes and does its thing and then comes back. So it’s acting very much like a dog and there's still this thought in the back of my mind that it’s going to spray me, but it doesn’t. It’s very curious and it seems that now I have a skunk as a pet. And then the dream shifts. I’m in an outdoor place of some sort. There’s a lot of people gathered and my old olympic lifting coach is there and he’s juggling. He’s got a crowd around him and he’s doing these crazy moves with juggling pins including catching them while he’s upside down and then doing cartwheels.

So in this dream, I’m with A.G. and Daren. and we’re on our way to a concert. We stop at his parent’s place which isn’t where his parents actually lived. It’s in a city called Burlington and they’re living on Plains Rd. The house is really dense on the inside. It’s like a hoarder house where you can’t walk through the hallways. You can’t see what’s on the other end of the hallways. They have all these pets that they’re constantly looking for because they can’t find them in all this hoarding mess. So we arrive there and I guess we have to stay overnight. We’ve arrived late and the concert is the next day in the afternoon, so we’ve decided to go and sleep there because it’s closer to leave from his parents’ place. When we get there, his mom is looking for one of the pets - it’s this weird amalgamation of a dog and a cat. At first I think it’s a dog but when I look more closely at it, it has the body of a cat and the neck and head of a dog. We see it for a moment and then it’s gone again. So all of us are trying to squeeze our way through this house. It seems like in the dream I’m doing this without any contact from anyone else for what feels like hours. Then I come out into the kitchen and I see Daren and I ask him if he’s had any luck. He says, “Not yet, but there’s this whole other half of the house I haven’t checked.” I don’t say this outloud but I’m thinking, “Wow, this house is so much bigger than it appears to be because of all the stuff.” So we start off together into the doorway through the other side of the house. It’s like the air in there is colder - the way it would feel if you were going down in altitude into a cave where it just feels damper and colder, but it still has stuff in it. I can’t see anything.

She says yes, but it seems like her answer is a little bit reluctant. The coffee shop is very busy and it’s not very big, there’s not a lot of space. She’s rushing around quite a bit. So I take her reluctance as bad timing on my end because I’m asking her while she’s busy, and it’s not that she doesn’t want to hang out. The scene changes and I’m in a residential area of a town and I’m walking to meet this friend. The houses are cute - they look like Victorian era houses with wrought-iron fences and gates and lots of English style gardens with roses. I’m walking up a hill and she’s standing halfway up the hill outside a house that has an archway with roses growing over it - like a trellis. I meet her but that reluctance on her end is actually still there and now I’m thinking that she actually did not want to meet with me. She’s just doing it to be nice, which makes me feel awkward. But I go along with it anyway and say hello. It’s dark. It’s not quite nighttime, but the sun is not out. It’s twilight heading into the dark. She turns up the hill and I follow her. We head towards a river or a canal. We actually get into a boat - like those boats in Venice - and start paddling a little bit. There is a boat in front of us and it has a bunch of people in it. I don’t know them, but she seems to know them and she wants to keep up with them. These are her friends that she would rather be with. For whatever reason, instead of calling to them or following them in our boat, we get out of our boat, into the water, and try to swim towards them. They’re moving way faster than we are and I see that the canal up ahead has a turn in it and I see the boat with all the people in it go around that turn and disappear and we are still swimming, trying to catch up with them.

Towards the end I'm a waiter, sort of, but not really. I'm up near the top. The place climbs the hill, and is below the road, rustic, wooden, surrounded by woods. A little outdoor bar or cafe near where the busses come in. I'm talking to some guy, a guest, and I'm going to take his drink order. As I'm talking to him I start to float upwards, and he and his friends are not used to seeing flying people, and they are bothered by it. I talk to them about it. He says, we had a drink, it was brought in by a, he didn't say a drone, but quad-copter, perhaps. But I start to float upwards, and am holding something connected to the table he's at, more like a bench and a long rail facing outwards. This thing I'm holding is connected by a white cord to the table he's at, and I say, yeah, sometimes the drinks come that way, and sometimes the waiter just flies them in himself. They're looking at me, and I say, people are scared of it because they don't understand, but it's really completely harmless. I start to leave, and float upwards and away, and add, you're just walking, because you don't have to. He responds with something, forget what. I leave, and descend 100 feet or so the valley floor. Very pleasantly rural, woods on the hill, farms on the flat in the distance. I'm trying to get back to where I had left my dream recorder, because I had taken it out to record some earlier incidents, in this dream. Then I'd gotten distracted.... I'm outside, scooting around, wondering if people will be amazed, but they don't react much. I wanted them to be amazed. There were two resort/schools. I much preferred the one described above. The other was a hotel restaurant sort of thing, that was a little (...)",

Around the point and tucked into a mountainside above the sea is an abandoned lodge. I walk around it, inside an old bedroom, a little creepy and musty. Nobody had slept there for decades. Much forgotten. Another lodge? Or another part of the same lodge. People that are staying there. All white, well to do, quite pleasant. A lobby with couches and people sitting there, and a little chit chat. Then it's time to eat. Meal time. I go to another room? A woman comes out. Your name's on a list if you're a registered guest. People start going up to be seated. I think, this is my cue to leave, so I do. I almost go out through a window, but go out through the front door, instead. A road, so I follow that by flying. Raining, thick clouds,wisps of fog climbing the mountainsides. Really atmospheric. I fly down this wide, graded, good dirt road. I come to a settlement. Another guy who is also flying. He is going faster than I am, and seems to have better control, doing loop-de-loops just for fun. This turns into something quite explicitly sexual in a building with several guys. The cutest and most forward of them puts his cock and balls over the edge of a sort of bench, and then lowered a crosspiece over them, to trap them there. Very hot. This other guy starts to blow him. I imagine that I am blowing him, and it's quite realistic, but I'm not actually doing it. Then he's not there and it's another guy, and then I'm not too sure who I'm blowing. He had a long skinny penis, and short black hair. Not unpleasant, but not great, sort of average. He's totally hard, and I ask him if he wants to get off and he says yes, so I jack him till he comes. It's not entirely real, sort of cartoonish. Something about West Centerville, riding a bus. There's a lot of decrepit houses, and it's the 40's or early '50's. I wished I had my camera.

It’s a place I have gone to many times in my dream world in the past, so it’s very familiar to me. Every time I go, I also notice how they’ve done some construction - they’ve built a new building or there are different garden features, farm features, whatnot. The way we get there is my husband is driving the RV and we have picked up another person in the RV. She’s a woman, probably in her late 60’s or early 70’s. We are coming up with a route and my husband has the map out. He's drawing all these different possibilities and trying to figure out how to get the RV to our destination. It’s difficult because the RV is big and there are narrow roads and some deadends, turnarounds and other things that make it more challenging to drive this 40 foot vehicle. We end up at Esalen and drive off the side of the road and park with half of our wheels in the farm dirt. A man comes up and he says, “That’s fine, don’t worry about it.” We leave the RV, get out and start walking. I end up leaving everybody else and going to the food hall. They’ve just finished serving lunch, so there’s leftovers. We haven’t paid to be there, so I sneak in and see there are basketfuls of platefuls of bannocks, buttery oat savory and sweet cakes. I start stuffing my face because they are so good and there are so many different flavors. I want one of everything. Other people are coming around and eating one or two. I’m thoroughly enjoying it, but also worried that somebody is going to come up to me and say, hey, you need to pay or you're not a registered guest, and because you have eaten these without paying, now you have to pay this huge fee. But nobody does. So I walk out and apparently my husband has been looking for me. We go up to our room, so I guess we have a room. It’s on the third story. My son is playing in the sink, but there’s something wrong with the sink so it starts filling up with water. W (...)",

    "text": "“The Sandbox'' In this odd mix of imagery and people, I find myself in a large two-story house with various people that I know from my extended family and where I currently work. The dream begins with C.R. from work and she’s been given the responsibility of taking care of two babies - one is about 10 months, almost ready to walk but not ready walking independently, and one can’t be anymore than 9 months older, not even two and he’s male. Later on in the dream when I ask what the children’s names are, someone tells me that the younger one is named Stacey and the older one is Alexander. So she’s taking care of them and I see her bring the babies out of a room and wonder if maybe they’ve just been bathed because they’re naked. She lays the younger one down on the rug beside the railing. The older one is standing. She tells them to stay there while she goes into a different room and gets diapers. I’m coming out of another room and I see them there and think, “Why is she laying them there? It’s really close to the stairs.” I’m thinking that the younger one can roll and fall down the stairs. I start to move towards that child and at the same time, she rolls and goes all the way down the stairs face first! I’m just horrified and thinking, “Oh my god!” She lands at the bottom and C.R. comes out of the room carrying the diapers, picks her up, and she’s okay! She carries her back upstairs and says, “Here can you hold her?” So, I do. I’m standing there with a naked baby on my hip. I’m looking at her and thinking, “Don’t you pee on me!” And that’s when I ask, “Whose children are these and what are their names?” Someone comes up to me and says the younger one is Stacey, the older one is Alexander. They belong to someone, but the name is muffled so I can’t understand what it is. That person isn’t there right now. Now the scenery that evolves around me is a kitchen. I’m standing there and there's people at the table. I see my stepmom’s brother and sister-in-law who’ve been very k (...)",

I pass increasingly interesting and complex ... things …. I come out near the water and there are boats and ships, that also get bigger as I go along. Not having any problems with altitude or control, and I float along taking in all in. I come down to a street, and there's people walking on pedestrian-only street. Awninged shops to the left, docks to the right. We are under some kind of extended covering. It all gets progressively weirder. People dressed in fancy 19th century garb are riding in carriages pulled by fantastic beasts. One struck me as rather camelid, but six legs that sloped outwards to the knees, then down, the knees were extremely large. Head also like a camel, but not quite, and large. Coat the color of a camel. I come to passage that goes into I dunno what. I follow it, and it goes some distance down some steps. At the bottom a very close, little space, and some kind of obstruction protruding from the ceiling. You can get by it by crouching down. It's scuzzy. The walls had been painted cream years ago, but now there is rust colored crud on the walls, an exudation, perhaps. Doesn't smell very good.

Someone is carrying me because I have an injured leg - I can’t tell if it’s my ankle or foot, but I don’t walk very well. Someone has been carrying me and they’ve set me down on this bench and I’m facing what looks like a really big store that reminds me of a Dollar Store or Big Lots warehouse type building. There’s all kinds of weird things in it, definitely nothing I would buy. It’s all plastic and seems like junk. There’s this young woman who’s working. She actually reminds me of a very feisty astrologer I know and I’m surprised she’s working at this place because she also does not approve of plastica and crap. But she’s there and I get up and hobble over. I still can’t tell what’s wrong and am not even sure what foot it is. I don’t seem to be in a lot of pain, I just don’t walk normally. I start to wander around and it smells kind of musty in this place. I walk through the glass doors and it’s dim inside. I wander through and there’s a section of Easter things - stuff you’d put in Easter baskets. She points out these little hologram hanging mobiles that I’ve seen in stores like Joann’s before. The one she shows me is a cartoon character of a fairy. She says, “Oh I think your kids would like that.” I get up and look at it. It’s cute, it’s interesting, but I’m not going to buy anything that’s plastic, even if it’s from the Dollar Store. I tell her, “Yeah, but I think my kids are too old for fairies.” Then the scene around me shifts and I’m still in a really big warehouse, but now it’s empty and the floor is dirt - it’s not a concrete floor.

There’s multiple stops and there’s some stops I need to get off of, but then I get back on the train. I get off and then I get back on. Now I’ve gotten off at this one particular spot and my kids are with me - I think I was picking them up. We don’t get back on the train at this same stop. We all get together and we go to a friend’s house and the friend's house is tiny. It’s in a more run down part of town. We’re there and her kids are there. The kids are all playing together and we’re talking. She’s telling me about how she’s ended a couple of habits she didn’t like. She stopped doing things the way she had been doing it and now she’s cleaning her house. Things look less cluttered in her space and she clearly felt better about all of it. Then I realize it’s time for us to go. It’s time for the kids to get back on the train. Before we go, another woman shows up. It’s a different friend who reminds me of my old hula teacher. She’s giving me some advice about how to parent because my daughter is definitely talking back and is resisting us getting on the train. I lose my temper in front of everyone and my daughter gets really pissed off and stomps off. Then both my friends are telling me how I could do it differently with her.

I’m in a long room and there are a few random tables set up with champagne and little bits of finger food. There’s small groups of people standing around and talking, mostly the artist’s family and friends. I see my first boyfriend and his parents, and I walk over and join their group. We’re chatting. The dream doesn’t expose the small talk we’re having. We break away from his parents - they’ve wandered off and I believe our conversation has finished. We say goodbye. There’s a partition at the back of this long room and we lie down together and cover up and embrace. I feel him. He’s getting hard and I want to bring him inside me. Then he buries his head in my chest and says something. I can’t hear what he’s saying but I just hug him. Then he says, “Let’s get up, I want to show you something.” So I do. We’re suddenly dressed. He takes my hand and we go outside and everywhere you can see is covered with water. He puts these shoes on and starts running across the water. I’m wondering how that is even possible, but I do the same thing and it is possible! I’m kind of scared as this is happening because what if I sink down into the ocean and I can’t swim. He’s running and he has purpose to his run, so I’m trying to keep up. He’s enough ahead of me that when he talks to a couple of people along the way I can’t hear what they’re saying. I start to notice that there’s buildings partially surfaced, so you can see the title of what the building is but the rest of it is underwater. I start to put together that this is an actual city. So as we go skating along the surface of the water, we stop at a particular place and he’s talking to three people and it’s technical stuff having to do with his music.

As we waited we watched as an extremely beautiful crystalline ice globe sort of condensed and formed out of midair right on the side of the shed but floating slightly away from it so that it was not actually touching the shed. As we stared at this bubble that formed it grew taller and smaller bubbles formed on top as I looked underneath it it was actually hollow from the inside in through it one could see the moons in the night sky.

I was woken up (in the dream) to several neighbor kids rollerblading down my driveway and into my backyard. I thought it was interesting that they were able to do this in the grass with no apparent issue. I saw them as I looked out my window and noted that they shouldn't be rollerblading in other people's yard. However, they were kids, and I decided that it was fine if they wanted to play in my yard as this created a more friendly neighborhood.  Later, I went outside and ran into the older of the two boys. He was somewhere around 10 years old, and and had short to medium length blond hair. He was skittish and acted very cat-like in how he would let me approach him and then run away. I was walking to the right down the sidewalk and he was tagging along and talking to me. Doug was walking with me, as were Jared, and maybe another friend.   As we walked, the boy began to tell me about how much he hated his life at home and how evil his parents were. I think he specifically used the word \"evil\". He told me that his parents were involved in demonic rituals, potentially said that he was possessed, and used holy water to try to purify the children or themselves. I wasn't quite sure at the time if he was being serious or if he just was mad at his parents for some reason and making up stories. He went on ahead a little ways and I discussed the matter with Doug who also wasn't sure what was going on.  The next day, the older boy came over to our house and hung out with us for a bit. He really seemed to like it with us, but I was a bit worried. I asked him if his parents knew he was at our place, as I wanted to make sure that they were aware that he was hanging around with \"strangers\" and that it was okay with them. He hadn't told them, and I suggested that he let them know, or that we go and speak with them together so that it wouldn't be weird. He seemed hesitant to do t (...)",

The city looked like I was walking around in Roman times - it was the architecture. Things were made of stone, there were carvings everywhere. It was very lush, actually, with Mediterranean type plants (not Amazon). As I walked through the city, I was kind of leaving the cosmopolitan area of it and walking to a place that was quiet. In this place, too, I felt like a lot of time had lapsed since I had been there the time before. Things were not the way they were the last time I had seen them. There were stones in the garden that instead of being upright, they were lying down and I couldn’t see what had been carved on them. I knew that something was carved on them and they’d all been turned down so that you couldn’t see what was on them. So I was making my way past them. No one else was there, just me. The plants had grown around them so they’d been turned down for some time. Eventually I came to a well. This well had stonework built up around it so there was about a 4 foot ledge around the well. I was leaning on it with my forearms and gazing downwards into its darkness. I could hear the sounds of water. I could smell it, too. I just stood there for a little bit with the well. Then I left an offering. I had something in my hand. I left it there. Then I got up and continued to make my way through the garden. But something caused me to turn back. I did and one of the stones shifted - it was a large one. All these stones I’m describing are at least as tall as a person. When I turned back and looked, I walk toward this stone that was now upright. It’s Minerva. I sat there beside her for a little bit and wondered what cataclysmic event has caused all the gods and goddesses to be turned away. As I was mulling that through my mind, I was also happy that something had happened that was allowing them to turn back up - to return.",

They told me that since they were closing and didn't have any cups that I could take, that they couldn't make me a milkshake.

We entered a room with white floors and chairs spread throughout which was difficult to navigate through with a wheelchair. We got to the other side and realized that we were a bit lost. We went back and found an elevator, but we weren't sure if it would work. The elevator didn't have any walls, but was a metalic gridded platform at the top of a set of stairs. It was hardly  large enough for both of us, and my assumption was that once you got onto it, the walls would come down and then it would move.  We did get onto the platform, but when I looked at the buttons, I didn't know which one to press. There were so many different buttons on the black panel, and I couldn't figure out what any of them meant. We got off of the elevator and went up to some offices where nurses in white gowns were bustling to and fro. I think I manage to catch one of them as she was leaving the busier area and she told me that I wanted to go up stairs and enter through an archway numbered 108. I went that way and two doctors met me before we got there. We were then both lying on the ground and one of the doctors was scanning William, saying, \"We have to make sure that there aren't any tubules such as pencils which you might have swallowed and would have come back up into your throat to cause stomach pain.\" The other doctor came over to me and was also testing something though I do not know what.  We got up and were still in the hospital, but the dream had changed. I was now with (or was) Elliot McGabbhan and was trying to find help for some issues he was having. He ended up running into his therapist, Dr. Oliver Sacks, who was willing to speak with him briefly though he had another client in 40 minutes.

It has a case and the case is not on it, so I put the case on like it’s supposed to be. There’s also a vase of flowers in the room - I don’t know if somebody gave them to me, or if they’re just there. I put them next to the bed on this tall nightstand. This whole time I feel simultaneously trapped and nostalgic. This old radio stereo makes me nostalgic for my childhood and yet I feel trapped in this room and want to get out of it, especially since it looks like my ex is in there with me.

Now I’m really not wanting to because it’s a gross schmoozy dinner that I do not want to be a part of. He walks out the door and gets on a bike and starts pedaling through a crowd. I’ve followed him out and am watching him go.

There’s windows along one side and then at 90 degree angles from the wall of windows, there’s a series of four rooms sided by a brick wall on the other side. The wall of windows ends with a door that goes out into another hallway. So you can actually go out one door, down the hallway, back in a different door and back through all the rooms that are sided by the windows. In one of these rooms, I find Omar. He’s in bed with my sister. I think what an odd place for a bedroom. I wonder what they’re doing even though in the back of my mind I’m also thinking, “Oh my god, they’re in bed together.” In real life, they didn’t even know each other. It’s not like this is possible. So I walk over slowly and I thought maybe I should ask questions before jumping to conclusions. So when I approach them, Omar is talking about something very philosophical and I look at him strangely and he says, “What?” I say, “Well, you don’t usually get like that unless you’ve just had sex.” He looks at me as if he was betrayed. Then I add, “Or just finished some kind of meditation or something else relaxing.” Then I also notice other things about their body language. His leg is draped over hers. She hasn’t said anything yet. The bed clothes are also twisted and wrapped around them. So at this point he gets up and he’s upset and he’s kind of swallowed by a group of other people. I want to talk to him more, but each time he goes to another group of people, I get swallowed by them and another activity occurs. The first one I’m taken out of this building and into an outdoor area that has a campfire and people standing around talking in small groups. I look for him there but he’s not there. Then I go back through that realm into the observation area. I get a quick glimpse of him as he walks from that doorway into another one.I follow and I’m taken again into a different realm where people are in conversation, so I’m just floating around them.

There’s log tables with people sitting at them and food. The point of this part of it is I’m surrounded by people I do not want to be surrounded by. I love dancing but i can’t find anybody I want to dance with. And the people at this wedding are people I don’t want to share a meal with, so it’s not very much fun. The scene immediately shifts and I’m in a farmhouse in a completely different era. I'm participating in making and preserving food. So various people are doing various things. There’s some people who are actually churning butter. There are people that are milking cows and bringing the milk in pails to the people that are churning the butter. I am aware that there’s a smokehouse and there’s people building the fires and curing and smoking meats. It's outside though. Both of these are outside - the smokehouse is further away. Of course the cows are further away than that. The churning butter is closer to the house and I’m actually in the farmhouse. I’m in the kitchen. I’ve been chopping and making what appears to be kimchi which is odd given the historical setting. I’m putting it all in mason jars and sealing them. I can still smell the aroma of boiling vinegar in my nose. When I finish this, I turn around and Omar is there again. He’s distanced from me again, so he doesn’t really know me. It’s like it’s Omar’s body but not his spirit in it. He sort of doesn’t know who I am. He tells me that he’s been aging Scotch. He tells me what he did with it. I ask him, “Well, did it work?” He says, “No.” Then the time speeds up and all of a sudden it’s today’s time and I have the two kids that I have. I’m telling Omar that I have to leave to take my son to his dance lesson. I ask him if he wants to come. He says, no he can’t. So I’m disappointed, but I have to go.

People are living on top of it as though there’s platforms built up at the edges of the stream and they hold 50-100 people, each one of these and there’s buildings on top of them. So the stream is magnified tens of thousands of times of what a stream would be - it’s more like a river, but it’s not deep, it’s like a mountain stream. I live on one of these platforms. My kids are there, too. We’re busy collecting food and doing things to prepare it. It’s very rustic. There’s no technology or anything like that. One day, I need to climb up the stream. So I'm doing this. My feet are touching the bottom of it. It’s hard work because this stream is fast flowing. At one point, I can’t move anymore. I’m struggling and still trying to move. Then there’s a blank in the dream and I’m simply aware that I’m lying in the stream face up and it’s flowing over me and I can’t move any of my limbs or my body and my head. I’ve been cut open. There’s various parts of me that have actually been harvested. I don’t feel any pain. Then I leave my body and I circulate around the community. I come back to my body at certain times and every time I come back to my body I’m starting to forget that it’s mine. One day when I leave it, I go with my kids down to the ocean. You get there by exiting the stream through one of these platforms, walking through the forested area down to the beach and then to the ocean. They’re digging a hole - the way you would dig for a sand castle - and then just sitting on the sides of it. They’ve made a tunnel through one side of it that goes through the hole they’ve made, down to the water. Every time a wave comes up it goes through this little tunnel, fills the hole and then washes back out again. They’re just  (...)",

She’s wearing a pink gown, her hair is done just right, her makeup is done just right. She’s this archetype of a “perfect” woman advertised in magazines. He’s being a gentleman - pulling her chair out, pouring wine into her glass, and being really attentive to all her needs. She’s responding to him. I’m aware that she’s intentionally being mean to me in showing her feelings towards my husband. I get livid. This is not unusual in my dreams. I’m punching and kicking and making a huge display. Then I have to retire to another room and rest for the night. Everybody has to lie down on floors and go to sleep. Then the next part of the dream, there’s an assembly of people sitting in chairs like in a college auditorium. There’s been a rebellion. Every year we base our family celebration (something like Thanksgiving) on multidimensional geometry. But this year, there’s a rebellion. This big guy who looks like he used to play football but is now heavy from beer and nachos stands up and draws a single dimension triangle with squiggles around it. He says we’re doing it this way this year. So he makes it really flat and simple. There are grumbles throughout - some people are really upset but can’t do anything about it, others are more supportive and happy it will be easier for them to understand. I am forced to join this new celebration. Everyone around me is heavy - they drink a lot of beer and eat a lot of processed food - they’re like your typical American. They’re making the feast. I am participating in making the feast. They give me a sip of this walnut liquor and I find it unusual that they have a taste for this liquor because it seems quite refined. Then somebody is talking about the walnut flooring they were able to purchase for their new home because somebody else maybe their girlfriend lent them $50 (...)",

The section of this dream that stood out the most was towards the end when I was in a dorm room. I was so exhausted from everything I’d been doing and I just wanted to lay down and sleep until the graduation ceremony I was to go to. I laid down on what looked like a chaise lounge in a bedroom in a dorm room. There was another bed across from me. The entrance to the bathroom was in between the two beds. Although I was exhausted, I was aware, not awake, but aware, that a young man had come into the room and was also getting ready for the graduation. I’m also young - we’re both college aged. He’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen, like from a different realm beautiful. That was the consensus all around, it wasn’t just my thoughts, the other women who were around thought the same. He’s being very considerate of the fact that I'm so tired and has not woken me at all, although I am still aware that he’s there, I’m still sleeping because I can feel the exhaustion dragging at my bones. There’s some sort of conversation he’s having with some other young women in the room about the plants, the flowers, that he has gathered for lies. He has a very magical quality about him - he seems very wise and ancient, like he knows a lot. So he’s explaining a little bit about why he’s picked plants for the leis for this graduation. He actually comes in and sits near me on my little bed, chaise-lounge, and is explaining one of the plants to some of the other women in the room, but I wake up at this point and as he’s explaining it, I’m looking at the plant. In the meantime, this beautiful young man creature is trying to get me to hurry because it’s time to get to this graduation. We haven’t been, but I’m just so mesmerized by all the different leis and necklaces in this box - there’s kukui nut leis and necklaces made of seed beds  (...)",

I’m heading up into this friend’s house and we are going through the home and into her backyard which looks like an obstacle course. There’s people training and it looks like she has been working out or coaching. Her husband is there with their baby. I know both of them, but what’s fascinating is I go up to her and she’s always been shorter than me, but in this dream maybe she’s standing on a stair or something. So when I go to hug her, I can tuck my head under her chin and my face is pressed against the top of her chest and I can feel her heartbeat. There’s something in this hug that’s a little bit more than friendly because there’s literal heat between the two of us that I can feel on my face and I can feel it radiating off her chest right above her heart. The history between this friend and I was not healthy in any way, but this seems like a forgive and forget situation with this hug and we are both very happy to see each other. She’s almost like a little kid. She really wants to show me all the things in her home and obstacle course/training area. I can tell she’s been training because my arm brushes against her arm and the muscles in her arm are so hard, they feel like a rock. I can tell she’s so happy to see me. She’s not reaching out to touch me or hold me on purpose, but I can feel that she wants to, which is fascinating because her husband is standing behind her with their baby. We decide to go somewhere. She wants to show me some other things. I’ve already said hello to the husband and the baby is so cute and adorable. So we all head out to the garage to get into her car. Her car is a Jeep which she used to have and sold in real life. This Jeep is even bigger and the husband and baby get in the back and I sit up in the front seat with her. She goes to pull out of the driveway, bu (...)",

The hostess continually seats people one after another in my section. As soon as I take a drink order from one table, she seats someone else. When I go to fulfill the drink order, there’s four more, and my section keeps expanding. So instead of ending at eight tables, there’s four more that I didn’t know about. I try to talk to her about this and tell her other servers need tables in theirs and ask her why she keeps seating me. The hostess stand is now miles and miles away from my section which is now miles and miles wide. People are angry with me. They’re like, “Where’s my drink?

But there were three beautiful white Lily bushes growing outside of it. It’s a house I’ve seen before in a dream. I knew the guy was there but I couldn’t explain how I knew, I just felt it. No one believed me. I went out one day to confirm my suspicions. I saw the reflection in the window of someone behind me and I turned and no one was there. A tall cowboy western looking guy in a blue flannel. I looked in the window and saw him again and when I turned around he was there with his wife and daughter and they walked away together really floaty and turned around to look at me once. They were ghosts. I was nervous but I went into the house and I saw someone sleeping. I got scared and ran all the way home and he was running behind me. I got inside and closed the door and he stood there begging to talk. So I talked to him and he was actually really nice and asked if he could help fix it up in exchange for living there for a year. I thought that seemed fair. He had a job and was saving all his money to marry his girlfriend. I agreed but didn’t tell anyone that lived with me about the arrangements. I went out to the pool and my kitties were swimming in it. There was a baby pony near the pool. I swam with the kitties. There was a swing set on the hill above the pool. And there was an eerie feeling about it. My niece was playing on it. I called her over to swim with the kitties and to look at the pony. I don’t think she listened.",

Even though some of the houses are older, they are quite well tended. They vary in size - shorter ranch style 2 and 3 bedrooms to taller, 2-story houses. As I’m walking through the neighborhood. I see what looks like an ilima tree - a small flower native to Hawaii, orange with a red center. But then it morphs and sometimes it looks like a hibiscus and sometimes it looks like a plumeria. This is all 1 tree that changes every time I try to get a closer look. I pluck one flower and put it behind my ear. I’m in a robe or maybe a lavalava (sarong) wrapped around me. It’s warm so I don’t need a lot of clothes. I continue walking down this street. I’m headed back towards whatever home I came from. There was some sort of celebration happening and I think I’ve left friends and family there. I just needed to go out for a walk and I’m headed back in their direction. As I’m walking down the street, I’m walking past this tall house with a wrought-iron fence and stone pillars. There’s vines growing up it and an entrance with stone steps up to a gate that would let you in. I can see there’s a pond in part of the front yard. I can see there’s very tall windows - they’re tall and arched square window panes except for the top half where the arch happens with quarters of a circle and it’s grey stone. You can see into the house. I see all of this and immediately think how exhausted I am. I fall asleep right there on the sidewalk. Whatever I’m wearing turns into a fuzzy blanket and I wrap it around myself. I curl up right there on the sidewalk and fall asleep. I keep thinking how exhausted I am. Yet while I’m asleep, part of me is still awake and listening. I can hear from the other side of the stone wall the voice of a woman who used to be my teacher. She’s talking to her daughter.

I was walking across a lawn near the house of someone I knew who had several daughters playing outside on two tree swings. I came in front of the swings and had to duck down to avoid being hit by the besandaled feet of the two girls. I may have not ducked down low enough and their shoes scraped my side.   As I kept going, a man showed up who called himself \"The Dream Master\" and revealed to me by some means that my entire reality had been a lie and that the world I knew was under his control. He had long, blond hair and reminded me a bit of some TV character that I have seen. He proceeded to destroy my world and then reset me to another point on my timeline such that I had no recollection that he had been there.  I was going about my day to day life with no suspicion that anything was wrong, when as I walked down the road, I found myself in a car with the Dream Master who turned and smiled at me and as I realized that once again my reality wasn't what I had thought it was. He drove me to a building where he let me out. To my left was a shiny metallic building and as I watched, he began to destroy it. It disintegrated and I ran in the opposite direction. I entered the building to my right which was an extremely large multi-story complex. As soon as I was inside, it too began to crumble. I ran further and further into it, with the floors falling to pieces behind me. I was trying to go far enough into it or up in it that I would be safe.  The dream transitioned into my staring at the Dream Master. I tried to attack him and managed to bite of several long shreds of flesh on his arm but they turned to some kind of chicken or beef in my mouth as I hadn't really hurt him and he was still in control and only messing with me. It was then that I realized that while my previous reality may have been fake, what was happening  (...)",

There’s a function, so it’s quite crowded and there’s a lot of people, most of whom I don’t know. I see the artist who is an old boyfriend. We’re talking for a bit and he now lives overseas. We have a conversation. The conversation is over. I circulate more around with people. The scene quickly deconstructs. I’m sitting on a couch across from another person on the couch in a studio style flat. There’s a large screen TV elevated above a hearth, but there’s no fire. The person sitting there is not anyone I know. I feel like I had a relationship with him, but it’s over and it’s been over for some time. He’s grilling me over a letter I just received in the mail from my friend the artist. I’m reading the letter, it’s two pages long and there’s a lot of information in it. First I scan it. Then the person on the other side of the couch says, “Did he say anything to you personally?” I say, “No, it’s just news.” Then I’m reading it again. There’s a story about his cat named Lima. I’m thinking, “Oh no, what’s happened to him?” because he has two of them and he’s really quite attached to them. So I zero in on that story. I’m reading that the cat is missing. He’s written that he was working outside painting and as is its habit, the cat came with him. There was a group of kids, an insurgence, playing in the street. They captured the cat and took it. He started looking for it. He tells me in another paragraph that the cat has disappeared for a few days before. The city is surrounded by farmland so the cat has spent some time in the barn. Then my dream scene changes to that actual farm. I see the actual cat in the barn.

Aliens come, that look like people, but everything about them is in shades of brown, clothing, hair, skin, almost but not quite monochromatic. A medium shade of brown. I only see them once, relaxing on chaise longues on the deck of a small ship (?) in the presence of normal humans who pay them no regard. Earlier, before the aliens come, there's a lot about some old pulp sci-fi paperbacks that I have picked up in a street bookstall. I see the covers, author's names and titles very clearly. I had three of them. One is something I remember from my high school years. Then a lot about trying to find who to pay for them. A bit like an antique mall, but instead of a central till, each stall or booth has its own, but I can't find anybody to pay. And then of course I lose those books, and can't find them, but find some others. Then the aliens come and start to take over. The small ship we're on, they're trying to work it free. There's water moving, the water we're floating in, is moving intermittently, at times a great cascade to the left, at other times still.

At one point I'm on the deck of this ship, port afterquarter, and we bump against some barrier, causing some superficial damage to the boat, but nothing actually serious. A female captain?

    "text": "We were in a GTA 5 like computer game and were witnessing a car chase in which fancy yellow sports car was easily outstripping a cop. He was toying with him knowing that he couldn't be caught. We thought this was odd because the game was single player and yet the driver was acting like a real person with a sense of humor. We weren't sure how someone else had gotten into the game.  In any event, we got too close to the chase and the cops came after us. We had to smash one of the cop cars and get away. It was as if we were our life-size selves but also in the video game such that the cars were like toys and we could easily destroy them or move them with our hands.  We left this scene and found ourselves on the top of a tall telescoping or terraced hill. It was very green and surrounded by mist. There was some sort of conflict nearby. As we approached, we saw that there was an army and maybe some skirmish which had been resolved. Possibly a civil war even. I found that I had a gun on my person and as a group of soldiers were approaching me I hid it under my shirt by my stomach. But as they drew closer and were going to question me, I carefully withdrew it and set it down on the ground slowly to make sure that there could be no misinterpreting my motives.  I thought that this was successful, but they surrounded me and I found that they were preparing to execute my by firing squad. I managed to cause a diversion, maybe by pulling out a gun, and dove headlong off the side of the terraced hill. I flew or fell all the way to the bottom where I landed and was able to escape into the mist avoiding the bullets which were coming after me. I may have felt one of them hit or graze me but it did no significant damage.",

I have an odd conversation with a woman, sales staff or proprietor. I can't seem to get out of her how much she wants for these three candles. But then, after the longest time, it is ten dollars, or perhaps nine. So she takes them to the register at the front, where things are again odd. She has black hair, and wears some kind of little gift shop outfit. I get to the counter, and am standing right where the woman deposited me. I'm at the end of a table, and the cashier is at the other end. People come up and she waits on several other people before she waits on me. Then I realize there is an informal line, and I wasn't in it, so I am the clueless one. But it wasn't easy to discern what was what. When I finally get up to the cash, the candles are not on the table. They had been, and I left the table just for a moment and when I returned, they were gone. There are bunches of smaller ones. I point out that the candles I wanted were gone. They were rather squat, possibly bell-shaped. The woman points sot the other, shorter ones, but they turn out to be tomatoes. I don't buy anything. With some older female, possibly a relative. She's got two very large, oblong boxes. She's doing something with them. She says, she doubts I have any powers. I say, well, I use my powers judiciously. It's takes a great deal of mental effort, but I raise one end of the box she's working on up a few feet, using mental energy alone. She just carries on, doesn't even notice. I'm not interested in trying to impress her, so leave off. I'm looking at a Longview newspaper. I was a radio announcer? Or loudspeaker announcer of some sort? I'm looking at the want ads.

    "text": "“Whose Room Will Be Whose?” In my dream last night, I am part of a family that’s moving in with another family. I guess there are parents in the dream because I’m a teenager, but we never see the parents that belong to us. So, the family that lived there before we lived there still have some of their stuff in some of the rooms. We are going through the whole house deciding whose room will be whose. There's two boys in the other family we're going to be blended with. I have at least one sister, although it’s never quite clear the extent of our family because there’s more bodies in that house looking at rooms than just two boys and two girls. The house was originally an older house and the family before us added on other things and made it into a very big house. So in the kitchen, which I’m thinking the original one would have actually been quite beautiful - we go upstairs and then there’s a landing. The stairs open up with three stairs that go to one side and three stairs that go straight and three stairs that go to the other side. So the original kitchen would have been three sides and then open on the fourth side. But now there’s two rooms that go off - one straight ahead and one to the side, so there’s been two walls that have been put up. Now the kitchen is very tiny. It’s long. There’s a counter, a sink, a stove and some cupboards above that. One room that the family before us has put up a wall so there’s no doorway left, so you have to turn your body sideways to get in. It looks like the father of the previous family has made it into a computer room, but what blows my hair back when I walk into the room sideways is the number of intricacies of all these different parts and different computers. There’s 4 monitors and all these tools and it’s like he builds computers. There’s stuff stashed literally everywhere from floor to ceiling. Then somebody from the other family is in there and I'm surprised because I didn’t realize they had this other kid, but she’s sittin (...)",

We’re talking about our time as dancers and I’m asking her if she ever comes back and takes classes. She answers, “Occasionally.” Then we go in and it’s like it always was - a big open space with tall windows and curtains from floor to ceiling. It brings back a lot of good memories. There’s a baker who has set up a little stand. She is a famous baker (though I don’t know about her in waking life). She’s known for her scones. I stand in line and see this delicious cake. I order a slice and am thinking of what to get for my son. I want something that’s not very sweet. I’m trying to tell her that I want the least sweet thing she has. She can’t hear me because there’s a lot of construction sounds in the background. I end up yelling, “Least sweet! Least sweet! The not sweet one.” She finally understands me. She’s looking down at me from a platform and says, “Well, everything is sweet here.” Then she pulls a chunk of brown bread of the wall and gives it to me. She also gives me brown bread for me, too, so I don’t get the piece of pie I thought I ordered. I thank her and nipple on it. People have cleared out of the space now. There’s a threat - like a terrorist. But I’m not concerned yet. I see an empty Valentine’s Day card and write on it. It’s a lacy card that goes in a sheer lacy bag.

People are in cots in little recessed areas, two by two. A guy, I was in his zone. We shared a big double bed? Or two separate cots. I come back from something, forgotten, and things are rearranged. I now have an area to myself that's away from everyone, separated. Separated by a hanging, at least across the front, a big tarp or blanket. I go in there, and it's warmer than the outside. When I first see it, it's open. Like a hospital, and there are various supplies piled on the bed, like it t wasn't intended to be used, but now they are going to give it to me. At first I say, I don't need all that. But then I think, I'm actually just as glad to be away from everyone as they are to have me away. There was a reason for this, perhaps more than one. Something about coming back from somewhere. I had this stick-on label. First I put it where I first entered this corridor of beds, and then realized I'd put it in the wrong place, so try to take it off to put it on my place. But it's quite noisy, the sticking on and peeling off, noisy, crinkly plastic, and I feel like a fool.

This ball/balloon is floating up so high we can see the Earth and all the continents and oceans. But the ball is slowly losing air and we’re getting lower and lower. It’s getting smaller and we keep readjusting our grip - grabbing more of the ball to pull ourselves back up because it’s getting smaller and our position is not as stable on it. While the ball is getting lower, we’re going over some parts of the land where I can see castle ruins in some places and they look like medieval castles and some look like those gorgeous buildings in Russia. They’re different styles of castles, but it’s all ruins and no humans have been there in a long time. Then we’re floating over the ocean and the ball is getting closer to the ocean. I look down and begin to panic because I can see the ocean is vast and incredibly deep. Both my brother and I do not want to land in that ocean with this balloon. So I manage to adjust the balloon so the part where you blow the air in is near my mouth. I start to blow air into it all while hanging on and floating through the sky. I get the balloon a little bit bigger and before when we were up at space-height we were able to direct which way the balloon was going, but once we got further down, we couldn’t direct it until I blew more air into it. It gives us enough time to have control over its direction long enough to land someplace where there’s water, more land and ruins. These ruins look like metal buildings that are all rusted. We land on a metal ledge and there are huge elephants with really long tusks and they’re essentially killer elephants who are not so happy to see two humans in their territory. It’s very clearly their territory. So now my brother and I have left the balloon and we’re trying to run away. There’s parts we have to (...)",

There's a medium amount of people, not too crowded but certainly not sparsely populated by people walking around enjoying the fresh air. It’s a large body of water. It feels more like the Great Lakes as opposed to the ocean. I am there with a woman and a man. The man, although I seemed to know him in an arm’s length traveling companion kind of way, I don’t energetically feel like I know him very well. We don’t speak to each other in the dream, we just travel together. The woman feels like my daughter, although she doesn not know how to drive or own a motorcycle either. I suspect she’d be a little scared to do that. We all three have motorcycles. My motorcycle has a tray on the back - it’s quite wide, a little wider than the bike, I’d say it’s about 18 inches wide. There’s cutlery on it - knives, spoons and forks. There’s probably 60 pieces of cutlery on this, it’s quite thick and they fill the tray. We talk about it being time to leave and I realize that I need to get ready. So I gather the few things together I have for this trip. I start my motorcycle, so do the other two people and we begin to travel. We leave the pier and drive down a street, through the city, onto the highway. All the while, this cutlery is shifting around and rattling on the back of my motorcycle. I am a little worried it’s going to slide off the try and onto my body. It doesn’t, however. We travel through the day. I’m not wearing a helmet and it actually feels kind of nice. I’m navigating driving this bike rather well. Now I realize we are heading to a campground. I did not know this when we left the pier and I don’t have any camping equipment with me. It’s supposed to rain and I feel like I need to have something that will protect the motorcycle while it’s raining. So I tell my two traveling companions this.

I tell them that it begins at a facility and the setting is beyond high ceilings. There's painted brick walls, stainless steel appliances and really long tables - stretched picnic tables with benches along either side that would seat 40 people. I’m seated at one of these. There’s hooks beside the bench that have years hanging on them and lifetimes hanging from another one. They’re stretched out like husks of people but they’ve been elongated, like really, really long jumpsuits. There’s a guest speaker here. She’s there either to reset someone’s year or their entire lifetime. I’m telling her which person is there for what - either their year or their lifetime. Someone continually asks me what I’m there and every time someone asks me, I’m finding it hard to remember. I have to pause and think about it again. Then in the setting, I’m a participant again. As I’m telling her my story, she’s interrupting me like she doesn’t believe me. In the retelling of it, she’s speaking it again. She’s mixing up the facts on her own. At the same time, she’s telling me that she doesn’t believe me. I’m both questioning her credibility and getting frustrated by not being able to retell my own story. So l leave the room with the long benches and the stainless steel appliances and the hooks. I walk down the hallway and I go somewhere else in the building. The hallway after I left the facility was Central Senior school hallways. While I’m doing that, I meet another person who says, “What were you doing here today?” I say, “I was here in the dream room to reset my life and the guest speaker is a liar.” As I’m retelling that, the scenery changes and I’m in my great grandmother’s house, my Great Grandma Mac.

The view from it looks like the view from my house which is looking out onto a lava rock desert that’s got dried grasses and smaller shrubs growing. The grasses are all golden in color, too. I’m aware of my protectors’ presence. I do see them fly off on occasion, go take care of things and come back. I’m just observing the whole time, trying to figure out how to fly, myself. I’m aware that they are going off to fight things, then they come back. I’m a little concerned because I don’t want them to get hurt, but they seem to be fine every time. Then the dream shifts a little bit to another spot where I’m walking across and open space - kind of a grassy space, but I can feel there are other things around me like maybe trees and possibly houses, but I’m not completely aware of what is around me. I just know there is enough space for me to practice my flying and I’m in human form for this. I start walking a (...)",

Very pleasant, end of school year function thing. I think to myself, I spent so much time with these people, and it's been pleasant and good. Then it goes in another direction. There's an abandoned shack, building. Frame, boards, no longer sound. Something very creepy about it. Nothing actually happens, but I'm afraid of it, like there's a presence. I go on a hike through the woods near there, and that's creepy, too. I climb upward over some rocks, not so very difficult. A tree, trunk maybe 14” in diameter, and it fell to one side, or sagged to the ground. It was rotten. I get back up to the top, and think... wow. Deciduous woods. As I was going down the path... after I get back up, I'm telling people, still the Palantino crowd (?) at one point on this hike I was holding a nutria and kissing it. But I don't actually recall it happening (in the dream I don't recall it), even though I'm telling them it happened. A car. It's a bit like the old American Motors Ambassador. I take this car. It's not mine, but I”m going to drive it back home. It hasn't been driven in a long time. I want to check the oil. I need a rag for the dipstick. When I open the hood, the engine is completely different. A lot of white ceramic. It's hard to tell what's what. There's still a dipstick, though, and I check the oil and it's not liquid. It's semi-solid, maybe as viscous as petroleum jelly. Had a slight brown tinge. I think, that's odd, and I wonder if it's okay. Somehow I have the key to the car, but I never actually drive it (but see below). When I first see the odd, ceramic engine, I get very concerned. I think, I really need to take this back. It's a stolen car. The owner may not know it's missing, and may or may not notice for days or weeks, but it's still a stolen car. I'm very anxious about that, but I w (...)",

I’m accustomed to being in a hula halau, so I go to one of the practices to join, but the kumu tells me no, I’m not allowed because I don’t know. I feel really sad and rejected and also a little bit baffled because they're actually practicing a dance I know. In fact, as I’m watching some of the other hula dancers, they don’t know it as well as I know it. So I’m watching this and the kumu has asked me to leave. So now I’m watching this from afar. I’ve gone away from where they’re doing this practice. They’re doing this practice for a bigger show. So I've backed away and am up on a little bit of a rise. I can see them practicing. I do not understand why they won't let me dance especially since I already know the one they’re doing. So I leave and I follow this man that I know from the village. He takes me into his house and he has so many sacred items and then just stuff. He’s going through it and he’s telling me about why I can’t dance I think, I’m not sure. But I’m watching him going through all of his things and I keep thinking: “Why so much stuff?” Then the scene changes and I’m at an outdoor gala and it’s all rich and famous people.

We talk a lot, Brown hair. I follow her after several episodes and a lot of conversation. I'm in the place where she lives, for a long time. At one point I ask her about mushrooms. She has a gallon storage bag about half full of dried psilocybin mushrooms. And she has another kind, quite orange. I ask what those are, and she gives the second half of some scientific name. I can buy some if I want. I reply that I really need to think about this some more. Maybe later. She's talking about her boyfriend a lot. She's saying he's right there in romance and love, but then there's other areas in which she's quite disappointed in him. In the dream the reasons are specific, every word clear. In the back of my mind, I think I need to tell her about Megan, but I never seem to get around to it. At the end of the dream, I'm looking for my calling card. I've got a stack of papers, and it's not in there. Then I think, it's in your wallet, dummy, but I never seem to get around to taking my wallet out.

It's like a tour bus. Some kind of street fair... much forgotten, beginning forgotten. Free food. Canned fish. As you go down the line, the offerings become bigger and stranger. Hunks of smoked meat. I'm picking things up one after another until I can't carry any more. The last one is a piece of smoked meat, but there are bones attached, Most of the animal is there. It had all been cooked or smoked. I'm carrying this too. I manage to miss the bus. The bus is just pulling away. I knock on the door, but it doesn't let me in, just drives away. I don't have my phone, don't even know what town I'm in. So I start to float along, and that turns into another bus that is going down a road, doesn't look like Washington at all. In the dream I'm wondering where I am. Some narration, about heading into a trap, will be blocked on three sides. Now we're not even going on a road, we go across fields, and gravel, and across a small river, without going into the water, but there is no bridge, either. We come to and go up a very steep hill. When we get to the top, this big craggy, heavily glaciated mountain appears. Pointy, not a broad rounded top like Rainier. Some bit, Morley and I. We're walking up a long, very steep path, to the top of a mountain. It's barely passable. He's having a little more difficulty than I am. When I get to the top Morley is no longer with me. At the top is a parking lot, a visitor center, and some scientific installation. Very sunny and bright. I go into the visitor center, and there's a fair number of people, not crowded. One of them is an Asian guy, not anyone actual, that I had met some years before at a potluck in Middletown. Somehow I'd lost track of him. We were very attracted to each other, and still are.

It may have been after a storm as the branches sagged toward us and some may have even been partially fallen and uprooted. Dad was acting strangely and had difficulty avoiding the trees and kept waking out into the middle of the road where it was more dangerous. I realized that this must be caused by his Alzheimer's and I carefully helped him to reorient himself and proceed down the path.  Upon waking, I was struck by the reality that one day I will have to stand by my parents as they are about to die. The thought fills me with sadness, but I also see the beauty in this and am glad that I will have the strength to be there for them and to take care of them when they need it. I hope this is a long ways off. This dream made me appreciate my parents more and I will try my best to see them soon and to have some good conversations and walks together.  I was also left with the slightly psychotic idea that my dad is going to develop dementia or Alzheimer's. Even now, it somehow seems that this is going to the case. And this is not the first dream where something like this has happened. A couple times in real life, I've also seen hints of something in my dad that make me think that this might happen, but I don't know if it's anything real. I hope that I am wrong but it will be interesting to see if this is based on some reality that I have partially subconsciously picked up on. It's strange because my mom always worries that she is getting dementia because she always forgets things and mixes up words and names but somehow I don't find this likely at all and am much more worried for my dad.",

The water was very cold though--it may have been winter--and we were a bit hesitant to do it though we knew we could. I prepared to go out, but my brother told me that I would have to swim by myself for an hour and that he would join me later when it was his turn. I didn't want to do this by myself as I was afraid that I would get too tired and that with my asthma acting up again (as it was in real life at the time) I would not be able to make it.  I decided that instead of swimming we would go kayaking and we got both of the kayaks ready and were out in the middle of the lake.

At one point I can see the towers of downtown LA in the distance. It's all very built up, though not as much as New York. It's warm, and the sky is a little hazy, bright sun. A lot of red brick. In the immediate area of Grauman's is the only place with trees. Large palm trees with very wide spreading fronds, just on that block and the adjacent blocks, to spiff up what is otherwise a bleak streetscape. I go for a long walk. It's a tourist zone. Long lines of people waiting to get into several different jazz clubs. It all seems utterly concrete, detailed, and real. I hear the music. People also lining up for other things.

I’m gazing at the house they’re talking about and I see this woman come out of it. I think, “Oh, this is her house.” They’ve built a change room for their pool and it’s like a giant treehouse. It’s unfinished with just dry-wall, but I can see her family coming out of it and they’re changed and ready for the pool. I walk a little closer to look at the pool that everyone was making fun of. The idea is genius. It’s like a large long narrow plexiglass tank that’s obviously been made to fit into the area between the rocks. It’s attached to the foundation of their house on one side and the rocks on the other side and it’s clear, so whatever nature is around it, is seen through the pool. So it’s almost camouflaged - you don’t notice it right away. It’s not finished, however, and there's no water in it. She sees me standing there and invites me in.

I send Carrie to go get it because I don’t want Sabrina to see me. But I can see through Carrie’s eyes or something. I can see what’s happening. So when Carrie sees it, she gets really upset and she goes to try and get the crystal. But she doesn’t have enough power to battle Sabrina. So I step into Carrie and Sekhmet’s in me. I essentially battle Sabrina. to get my crystal back. I am just as powerful as Sabrina, if not more powerful. I can match her power but not in a dark way. The whole time, Carrie thinks she’s the one who's battling, and Sabrina does, too. They don’t know that my power went into Carrie. Sabrina is shocked that it’s Carrie. I don’t know if I get my crystal back.",

Then other things happen that I can’t recall. I’m on a walk along the coast with a group of people. Ursula is in the front and I’m pretty sure Mary is still with me along with other people. We’re walking along a narrow path to a festival. I look over at the ocean and it’s the most beautiful coastline. I’ve been there before in dreaming life but I don’t recognize it from waking life. Every time I see it, I am thrown into pure joy because of the beauty. It’s the most beautiful blue you’ve ever seen - it’s one little sunny protected coastline without big waves. The water flows smoothly in and out. I throw my arms up in pure ecstasy at the beauty of this landscape. Ursula looks back at me with a judgmental smirk and keeps walking ahead, but it doesn’t change how I feel about this beautiful place on earth. Then we arrive at the festival and I put my bag and shoes down. In doing this, I lose everybody and I’m suddenly alone in a big crowd of people. At first I’m not concerned, but the day goes on towards night. I don’t have my bag, money or shoes and I don't know what I’m going to do for the night. There’s a beautiful wading pool where people go to bless and cleanse themselves after their journey. I see a young man I recognize from chiropractic school in waking life. He’s very kind and he’s with me. We find a little spot to lie down and rest for the night. In the morning, they start breaking down this entryway to the festival. I tell them about my missing bag and shoes. The guy is really helpful and is looking on the upper and lower levels. He says he thinks he saw my shoes and may have seen my backpack, too. He’s looking for me and telling other people to help me look. But they don’t find either thing. I decide to go on and know I’ll find the group of people I’m supposed to meet up with soon enough.

He’s selling the house they live in. I’m so sad because they're not going to be closeby anymore and he’s going to be having the kids full time. So I won’t get to see them because they’re not there. But what is the most sad is when I walk over to his house - he invited me over to see if I wanted anything from it because he was selling it furnished with all the things in it, including some of the kids’ stuff and some of his stuff and things I had made for the kids. He was leaving it all there, leaving it up to the realtor to sell the house as furnished. At the time I go over, he’s there with our son and our son is going through all his things, grabbing what he wants and leaving the rest. I’m feeling so heartbroken about it - just the fact that they’re moving and the kids are going to be far away and that there’s all these things that are unwanted, uncared for and untended, including things that I have made for the kids. Oddly enough, my daughter is nowhere to be found in this, she’s already moved on. My son is also not incredibly sad. He’s very pragmatic about what he wants to take with him and go. I’m looking around and the house is full and my ex is just leaving all of it where it is. They both leave and I’m really sad when they leave when I say goodbye to my son because I feel like I’m not going to see him again. That feels heartbreaking. Then I’m standing there in what feels like the wreckage of a life. I’m standing there in the house and the realtor comes with a client and is showing the house. I’m there but it’s almost like they can’t really see me. I think it’s odd that this person is contemplating moving into this place with so much stuff still in it. I leave because it feels so heavy to be in there and I go back across the street to my apartment which is just me. I’m sitting on the balcony. There’s a gorgeou (...)",

    "text": "“The Concert” The setting of this dream is the house I used to live in in Toronto. It starts and I’m in the kitchen with many other people. I had three roommates in this house, sometimes 4. It was close to UFT. Most of us were students, though some were not. I don’t know everybody in the kitchen this particular day, though I do know some of them. Everything in this dream is long and slow motion and drawn out and stretched in terms of the background. It’s not that people are moving in slow motion, but the minutes between things are elongated and stretched. I woke up feeling really heavy and groggy. In the kitchen, someone is making toast and the toaster is way across the kitchen. While the toast is in the toaster and I’m waiting for my turn, there’s at least 7 people that come in and out of the kitchen and have conversations, then leave the kitchen again, and the toast is still in the toaster. It’s not burnt, though. I can see the elements are still on, but it’s taking ages to toast yet the relationships among people are moving at a normal speed. I don’t question this in the dream - it’s not until I wake up that I notice everything in the dream is taking longer. In the kitchen, I’m oblivious of this distortion of time. I do, however, have these conversations with people. When I realize I’m not going to have toast that day, I leave the kitchen and go upstairs to my room. I go through the drawers in my room, looking to see what's there because a concert is happening tonight and Omar is meeting me at my house along with a couple of other friends. I start to prepare and I’m deciding what to wear. In one of the drawers, I find a bunch of checks. I look at it and wonder where these came from. When I start to look through it, I realize these are checks that a whole bunch of people have given me. They are of various amounts for an endeavor I’m supposed to be taking. They have invested in me. I realize I haven’t put them in the bank and they aren’t very safe where they are ro (...)",

These buildings were used to power the city and contained generators. The outside of the building was green with a fairly low ceiling and maybe some kind of sheet metal roof of brown. For some reason the doors were unlocked to power stations and while one wasn't supposed to go inside, there were no specific restrictions against doing so. I opened the door and entered.  Inside there were two giant cylindrical capacitor-like generators which were connected with cables. There were three cables, two of which were plugged, one to each generator. The ones plugged in were red and black, with a blue one on the right. I remembered in the dream that as a kid, my brother and I had found such a power house on a trip to California and had explored it together. (In reality, we never did see such a thing.) I went over to the blue cable and dragged back behind the generator to where I knew I could plug it in. I don't remember what this would have accomplished but it was either to increase the power, maybe in some magical way, or to shut down the generators completely. There was a hint of something spiritual to making the connection between cable and generator. I failed to make it connect and worried that I would get in trouble I left.  I walked a ways away across a grassy field and over a small ridge where I set up my bivy hopefully out of sight. My mom, who was a police officer then came up to investigate who had been in the power station. I was thinking that they wouldn't be able to see me over the ridge, but I was wrong. She came to me, arrested me, and locked me up inside of the power station until she could have higher authorities come to take me away. However, I had a plan. When she was taking my finger prints outside of the power station, I used a magical spell which turned my finger prints into those of animals and I used a false  (...)",

The house is really spacious - it’s very large like a sprawling ranch style house with a deep full basement that you wouldn’t even know was there until you went into it. There were so many rooms. I used to get lost in there as a child. I think that’s significant. Both levels open out onto the shore of Lake Ontario. In the bottom level, there’s been a lot of excavation. The big patio doors open out into a lower area of land and you can walk straight from there down to the shore where there was a boathouse. It’s also concealed until you get right there. It’s dug out into the shore. The upper level does the same thing - it has a greenhouse on the side of it and you walk out that door onto the upper level which is a garden. There's plenty of natural light and it feels spacious. Everything is wider and deeper and taller when you’re in there. In the dream, those details remain consistent with how the house was in real life. I’m in that house and I’m walking down the long upstairs hallway into the kitchen. I see someone I know. I realize that she’s also living in this house and I didn’t realize she was there. We don’t speak at first. She’s just going about her own thing making some food for herself in the large kitchen.

I had to walk over to the machine and fiddle around with the settings in an attempt to make it reset the pins.  As I was doing this, Bernard walked out to the far side of the bowling alley and took apart one of the machines to see if he could fix the problem. When he had looked inside, he found out that the bowling alley (or casino at this point) had not installed all of the government-mandated protocols making it likely that someone could hack the systems and turn the tables in their favor.

I wasn't entirely surprised as I had always felt that the house's dimensions were large than made sense based on the number of rooms it had.  I entered one room and found a mostly open space with furniture only on the sides. Everything was wooden and the ceilings were high.

I’m not even totally clear who my companions are. I just know I’m responsible as I’m part of the team trying to keep humanity in general safe - it’s a general feeling of protecting, but I’m not sure who I’m protecting. It’s not anyone in particular, it’s just a group of people, some of whom are my friends and some I don’t know. It is totally a preparation for some sort of standoff or battle because me and the other friends or colleagues are planning and prepping and come up with a battle plan. It totally reminds me of a movie. I don’t even know what's coming for us, I’m not sure, other than that I know that me and some of the others have superpowers and we’re making our plans around the powers we have. One of the people on my side is projecting out this gel that freezes anything that’s coming towards us. So whatever it is that’s coming to attack us starts to attack - they have a green aura around them. This person puts out their gel and it does freeze some of the enemy but doesn’t last. As the battle continues, it’s a full on attack and we have to fall back because we end up not being able to hold our position. It was very dramatic and I can’t even remember if it was missiles being launched at us or what was coming, but it was a life or death situation. Then some other parts of the dream happen. The only thing I can remember of this second part is another group of people and a man who I don’t know and his friend who I also don’t know.

I intend to text Megan and tell her of it, but never actually do. Nico was there. He shows me or tells me about some weird costume that he has that he wears or can wear when he jacks off. He's into role play. I'm interested to hear more about it. He had all this meat. Big sections of large salmon and beef in a vat in the backyard, next to or even in the alley. He had a strange device. Had a long, eight or ten inch diameter hose extending from what looked like the top half of an enormous waffle iron. It was suspended somehow to mange the weight of it. He guided it over, and it just fit the top of the vat. He flipped a switch, and I guess it was steam that came out, because in a very short while, half a minute at most, and he takes the top off, and everything inside is cooked. This surprises me. How could it cook that fast? Overnight, the next day, the part where I own the house, some kind of handicapped games at UBC, the house is not far from UBC.

He was surprised however, when he made a move and I dropped down, locked his legs in place, and stopped him in his tracks. It wasn't that I was really that good or could win, but I had improved somewhat and had practiced a specific move.",

I start teaching. Then I turn away and look back. There is only a scattering of people. Most everyone has left and their mats are abandoned in a haphazard way, overlapping each other. It’s odd and doesn’t feel right for me to continue teaching. So I wrap up and I don’t even teach savasana. As I’m walking out, the teacher who used to teach this class walks past me and into another room. The chairs are lined up for a film showing and talk. I say hello, but there is a bit of awkwardness as I leave. In the next part of the dream, I see Victoria in her younger self - the one before she was married and became a mother, and before she was focused on her current business. I see her go into a glass house. She sets a fire that turns the glass black and opaque. I go inside hoping she’s still alive. She is passed out on a couch holding a cigarette. I’m amazed she hasn’t burnt up. I pull her onto the deck and try to resuscitate her. I try to call 911 on my cell phone, but then hear music. I look down confused and see I dialed 933. I panic and try to call 911 again, but then think I need to call her partner. She’s still not breathing. Then I wake up.",

There is an upstairs bedroom with a crib in it. There are two babies in it. One of the babies is mine or I gave birth to it. I can’t tell. It’s about a year and half and I have this knowing that I left it when it was younger and I’m coming back now. I’m not sure why I’m coming back. I just know that when I see this baby in the cradle that it needs nourishment - it needs feeding. So I bring it to my breast to nurse it. I’m worried that ti didn’t get all the nutrients it needed when it was younger. So while I’m nursing it, I can feel that it’s a relief for me somehow - like when you get engorged it is taking the pressure off my chest, out of my breast and the baby is getting what it needs. But the whole time I have this sense of sorrow or sadness like I had perhaps abandoned the baby or there was some reason why I wasn’t able to be with the baby when it was younger and I’m only coming back now to tend it now that it’s a year and a half. As I nurse the baby I can feel the relief in my chest and my breasts. It’s sucking hard like it’s desperate to get what I have for itself. This is the only part of the dream I remember; there are other pieces, but those are gone.",

I do not know why they let me stay at there house, but they were planning on leaving to go on a vacation or something medical related as they were doctors. I had to leave as I couldn't stay in the house by myself.   I met up with Doug and we began to plan a real-life D&D campaign. We decided that we'd amass an army in the desert and would build an underground Colosseum. It would be circular with tall pillars and three stories, two of which would be underground. The plan was to have a completely defensible base underground where we could retreat if necessary. Each story was probably 30 or 40 feet high and the total base was several hundred feet across.   We had an entire ensemble of army and workers or slaves helping us to build the base. All of this felt like something that would come out of the Old Testament or stories about the building of the pyramids. And all of this was being done so that we could start a D&D campaign.  As the dream progressed, I found myself with my dad driving in a red dodge dart from the 60s. It was actually called something slightly different in the dream, but was basically a dart. He was driving down the suicide lane of a busy road and cars kept swerving in and out in front of him barely missing us. I was sure that we would get in a wreck, but we managed to avoid any collisions.  The dream transitioned into one where there was this giant silver and red transformer-like mech man. He easily 30 feet tall and could transform into a vehicle. He wanted to race against me, and I was now a professional driver and had my dad's dodge dart. I wasn't too keen on racing him as I knew that while I could win, he would kill me if he won. I had to race him, and began to drive up a long spiraling track in a cylindrical structure. I'm not sure who was winning, but when we got to the end, he decided to attack.  At this point, I found myself (...)",

There’s also another part of the party - a child, a younger person, but I’m not entirely sure who it is. We’re headed out into what looks like a rather desolate lava field. But before we go, I am with a gypsy woman. I have met with this gypsy woman and we are in her caravan. It’s a cross between an old fashioned caravan drawn by a pair of horses but also an RV. It’s awesome. On the inside, it’s set up the way an RV is set up - you can see through the front windows where the driver’s seat is, but it’s still very witchy on the inside. This gypsy woman travels around but doesn’t necessarily look like a regular gypsy with scarves and whatnot. She is dressed in long robes and has longer hair. She has jewelry and there’s something about the jewelry - it’s earrings. I’m on a quest, but there’s two, so the first one I go on, I have a particular pair of earrings I pick out from her and I wear them. They’re a talisman of some sort. They are either protective or hold magic powers that enhance my own. I’m not entirely sure. I wear these out on this quest and I go out. I don’t remember the details of it, but I come back into the van. It’s time for me to continue on the quest, but it’s a level up now. I’ve realized this time around that the earrings are really important and I need a good pair for what I’m going to do. I’m going through what she has and there’s this pair that is just stunning. One earring is pearls with long chains and other gems on the bottom. The other earring that’s part of this pair is a huge chandelier earring which reaches past my breast. It’s really long. I put them both on and I can feel myself all of a sudden level up, like you would in a video game.

It felt like an Old Testament sacrifice.  We discussed bopping her on the head with a big stick, strangling, and possibly stabbing. I asked my dad if he thought it might be best if I broke her neck. I took hold of Lopsy and firmly grasped her head in one hand and shoulders in the others. I asked my dad if I pulled to one side as strongly and quickly as I could if that would do the trick. He thought it was a strong possibility so I went for it. I think something cracked, but she wasn't immediately dead. She lay on the ground with her neck broken, head to the side at a terrible angle, and twitching.   Even at this point, I wasn't at all sad. It was more unfortunate than anything else and we wondered if she was already dead and just twitching as animals will after they have been killed.",

We can still see. It’s luminescent. There's this flat area in the back where we’re all hanging out. The cake gets served and the flowers get put up. It’s totally messy but fun.

Dinner is going to happen later. But first, there is shopping for swimsuits. It’s curious because I actually found a swimsuit that I like - at least I like the colors and the cut of it. But the top is a little bit funny. So we’re going to a shop to look for other swimsuits. This shop is gorgeous - it’s totally open and I can see the ocean and palm trees in the background. I can hear the wind rustling through the palm trees. It feels tropical or at least it’s warm. I go into this shop and there’s big windows. It looks a little like a plantation, so it’s a bit old-fashioned, but updated. The floors are wood and there’s chandeliers for lights. The shopkeeper is a woman who looks familiar to me, but I don't think I know her. It’s me and my sister-in-law and another old friend from high school, Connie, who almost never shows up in my dreams, so it’s interesting that she’s there. We’re going through the swimsuits and they are gorgeous. They’re sort of a cross between swimsuits and lingerie because the bottoms don’t cover a whole lot adn the tops are see-through in parts. They have rhinestones and they’re made of lace or a mesh netting. Some are regular swimsuit materials. They are all in different colors - black ones with sequin embroidery, blue ones with gemstones on the front. I want to try all of them on even though I already have this swimsuit on. This swimsuit I have on is cute - a salmony pink color with orange and teal and mint green accents. It looks good, except that the triangle top has layers of ruffles. I hear myself say, “I don't like this top because it makes my tits look huge.” So I’m trying on these other swimsuits, but while the bottoms all fit, none of the tops fit me - they’re all too small and they don’t fit over my back. My back is too big and I’m having a hard time pulling the tops over or getting  (...)",

I compare him to Douglas, and this guy is ever so much nicer. Much forgotten. At first it's the middle of the night. We get up and start exploring the house. Now there's a girl there too. I'm not sure if we're on the top floor or the next to top floor. There's mom's old bedroom, and the one we're staying in, and then another bedroom that's smaller, that has the look of an artist's studio. We are on the top floor, as there is a small strip skylight. The window frames are all the original wood, and in perfect repair. I make a comment, it's 2020 now, and my grandparents move in in here when my mother was a little kid in 1927, and so it's been 93 years. I look for the window that had King von Grosmont's paw prints on the unpainted sill, but I can't find it. Then I'm on the main floor. The house is vacant. No one is living there, but it is being used as a place for art classes for elementary school kids. One big room, on the Greenlake side, where the living room was in reality, has tables and all this stuff. They're making stuff with food. Bowls of sugar, and other items. The kitchen is small, and the fridge is small too, and is a chocolate brown color. The lower hinge of the door is broken, so the door yaws outward when you open it. The inside is cluttered with bottles of beer and various food items. I don't investigate it closely. The surface of the stove is quite high. Now I'm talking to Adam. Turns out that the house is still in the family. Don't remember when I knew that, but Adam confirms it. Turns out Manuel had transferred ownership to Adam after Mom died. I become fascinated by the idea that I could spend the night there, or maybe even move in. I say to Adam, who pays the property tax and manages it? He says, I do. I ask him to tell me more, and he does. He's open to me spending a night. I think, gawd, I could even live here. I (...)",

One of them keeps coming with her husband and he drives her there and then waits in another room while we do the TT and then drives her back home. He doesn't go home in between. He’s old - probably 75 kind of old, and he has a very slow kapha like nature to him and he’s a genuinely nice man. I notice after the first couple of days that one of his eyes - his right eye - is swollen. I ask about it and say, “What’s wrong with your eye? Do you need some help for that?” He says, “No, it’s fine.” Then the next day when they arrive, it’s even more swollen. I’m questioning him and asking him - should he not go and see someone about his eye. Again he says, “No, there’s nothing wrong with it. It’s fine.” Then the next day he comes back and it’s puffy and there’s this white goopy stuff growing around it and it’s swollen to the extent that there’s only a little tiny space between the upper and lower eyelid. I ask him if he can see out of his eye and he says no. Then I say, “Can I get a little better look at it?” He says, “Sure.” I say, “That’s pretty serious if you can’t see out of your eye.” As I get closer, now I can see in his eye. As I look into his eyeball, I see that there’s globules of this white stuff on the surface of his eye. I describe this to him and tell him what I see. He says, “Oh, that’s related to this food that I eat.” I say, “Well, shouldn’t you get that looked at because it’s getting worse?” Then I realize I have to make a decision because he’s in denial and refusing to get help for his eye and now it’s visibly got gook on it. I’m afraid that he might be infecting my group of students. So I tell them that unless he gets the medical attention for his eye, they cannot come back to the YTT. But I’m also worried that we all might already be infected. Then I wake up.",

Heavy snow has fallen not long before, nearly a foot deep, covering everything. It's dusk, or perhaps dawn, half-light. The lay of the land slopes upwards to my left. I come to a shed on the right, plain plywood door with old, chalky, faded red paint. It swings open as I near it. It strikes me as spooky, and I'm not sure I want to go in, but (semi-lucid) recalling Senoi dream practice, I enter , and find a small, plain space, unpainted concrete block and wooden walls. There is a mellow light emanating from some source out of sight to the right, around the corner, where a passage extends. Nothing happens for moment, and then an object resembling a camera tripod, but not exactly, walks awkwardly by itself on its three spindly legs, one at a time in a weird three-step motion. There is no camera attached where one might be. It doesn't threaten me or seem particularly dangerous, but it creeps me out.",

I run into my friend Gina who I work with at the grocery store in real life. She’s beautiful. She’s a little bit sad - she’s distressed. She asks if the two of us will come back with her to the place where she’s staying. I follow her. She has a little shed and it’s like an artist studio. It’s in the main quad area of the college where a lot of paths converge in an open area. Her artist studio is on the edge of that. She’s a broke college student, for sure. We go in and there’s not much room. We’re hanging out with her and I’m looking at all the lovely things she has in her little artist studio. It doesn’t even have a bathroom and I don’t think it has a kitchen area - it’s literally just a shed with a bed on one side. She’s still really, really sad. I’m trying to cheer her up because I love the way she’s decorated the little studio. Her boyfriend shows up and her boyfriend’s name is Brandon. This guy is actually somebody I knew in high school - he was an upperclassman. There’s a little tension between them, like a depression. They’re together but they’re maybe together out of necessity or habit and they don’t know why. They’re talking and there’s a little bit of arguing. Now Gina is crying because she wants to go out and Brandon doesn't. Eventually I convince them all it’s going to be fine - let’s all go outside because this is a tiny little shed and we could use some room. We go out and it’s full dark now. There’s a fire pit happening somewhere. Brandon goes and sits near the fire pit. He’s tending the fire pit. It reminds me of those barrels that you see depicted in movies where you see homeless people standing around a barrel with fire in it - this is what it looks like.

The whole dream is inked and soaked with sinister dirty energy. It’s just horrible. There’s the feeling that something or someone is going to find us and we’re hiding. Then for some reason, people start going outside. We feel we have to. There’s not a choice. So we start walking single-file and there’s quite a few minutes between each person as they exit the building. So first I’m standing outside by myself and it’s dark, it’s nighttime. Then I can still see the lights on in the school because I’m standing in the schoolyard. Then a few minutes later, someone else comes out of the building and a few minutes later someone else comes out. There are about five people. Then from around the other side of the building come two people. One of them is viciously stabbing the other person. There’s blood everywhere. While the attacker is occupied with the stabbing, the people that I’m standing there with are like, “Where are we going to go? We have to go somewhere where we’re not in danger from this person.” Then we walk around to the other side of the building and there’s a tuck shop on the lawn. We’re hiding around one side of the tuck shop which is closed. Then the attacker that was stabbing is covered with blood and is walking through the crowd because more people have come to gather around the tuck shop. They’re standing social distance apart. No one is standing close together. No one is huddled. So it’s not even really a group. There are about twelve people and we know that he might stab each one of us, but he’s not coming close enough. He’s just wielding the knife around and walking drunkenly.",

The ship belongs to my friend Randy from high school. He is captioning it and he’s invited me to go out on the ship for a day. The wood is really old - it’s dry and cracked from the sun, there's no luster in it or polish on the outside. In order to make it sea-worthy, there's this thick almost hemp-like woven netting about 5 inches thick and tight weave that cascades down from the gunnels to the hull. It’s not on the bottom of the hull, it just goes way past the draft all the way down to the bottom. It’s got debris filtered from the water as it’s gone through. So there's no spaces between the weaves, between the organic debris and the tightness of it. There’s a ladder to climb up the side and it swings a bit with your body weight as you climb. So I climb up, wrap my leg over the top, hop down and I’m standing on the deck. Randy follows me and takes the wheel. We start moving. I can feel the sway of the ship on top of the water and am starting to enjoy the splashes that come up over the sides. The channel where we are is relatively busy. We haven’t gone all the way out into the body of water. We’re still going through the channel. I’m standing on the bow, leaning over, and I see rock - like a shelf of rock underneath the surface of the water. So I shout back to him: “Randy, it’s too shallow here, we’ll never make it through! We’re going to run aground!” He says, “No, no, we’ll be fine. I’ve done this before.” He’s maneuvering the ship and I’m positive it’s going to scrape because it looks like the rock shelf is only about 12 inches under the water and you’re going to scrape your keel. You’re going to get stuck there. The ship is still going over it. We maneuver over quite a few of these and come out into the open water where you don’t need to man the ship so closely. So I walk from the bow  (...)",

People sitting in a booth, eating, with this vomit on the floor nearby. You have to walk through it to get to the front door.

Somewhere west Los Angeles or Hollywood, as in part a. I may have been driving, looking for a freeway entrance, but couldn't find it. Then I'm on foot. I walk down a stub of a street that becomes a dirt path under massive, curving freeway overpasses. A mass transit line goes through there. I can't seem to find a station. Then I realize that I am outside a station, but I hadn't recognized it as such. No signage indicating what it was, but a lot of blue glass huddling under an elevated freeway. It's quite a large station. A young man scales a vertical wall about five stories high and jumps onto the platform. I think, well, I'm not doing that! And then I see there are some doors leading into it. I get on a train that I hope is heading towards downtown L.A. I find a seat. This all seems completely real and is quite vivid. Then I'm riding on a mass transit train, yellow exterior. Above one of the exit doors is a schematic of the line, but I don't recognize any of the names of the stations shown. I somehow gather that's it's inbound. The scenery is unremarkable southern California, lots of desert palm trees. Bits of conversations with other riders. As we approach downtown L.A., there's massive construction for many blocks. I remark to one guy that it looks like integrated transit development like in Montreal, with its extensive underground malls. I finally get to downtown L.A, where I look for a red line train.

I look around and it is on the seat I had been sitting on. I put it in my front pocket so it can't fall out.

His name is Josh and he’s about 9 years younger than me and he had a rough childhood and spent a couple of years in jail and he does have a daughter. This is all background form real life because in the dream, he’s talking with me and he’s trying to court me. He’s showing me all the things he’s really capable of, but he has a little bit of a wild look in his eye, like maybe he’s a little bit out of touch with reality. Some of the things that he’s done, he’s been fanatical about his methods and how he trains his body and how he sets up his house (it’s all very precise) and how he has practices whatever catches his eye. He’s telling me about how he set up the way he was going to gain custody over his daughter. He tells me how he did it. It’s very, very detailed step by step. He asks me if I want to meet his daughter. A little bit of time passes in the dream. I’m in my home now - it’s not very descriptive, I just know I’m there. He rolls up in his car and it looks like a lifted Jeep or truck and it doesn’t have any doors. His daughter is sitting in the passenger seat.

She has a stuffy teddy bear of some kind and it’s also filthy. She’s about 7-9 I think. He parks his car and they get out and come into the house. I’m offering to make them a meal - I guess they’re coming over for dinner. She sits down at the table and she’s wild. She doesn’t really talk. She has this high alert look on her face.

As we’re climbing in, a huge fireball shoots over our head and makes a big hole in the wall, going all the way through, singing everything in the house before making a hole through a bathroom wall and exiting. I’m worried about how the fireball has damaged the house and try to cover up the burned furniture, plants and art. I’m trying to get everyone out and to the street, so we can escape. That’s all we do, or at least all I can recall. In the next scene, I’m standing in a beautiful room on the second floor of a house. There’s a large window with a view of a body of water - either river or ocean. I look up at the sky and the clouds are so beautiful - they look like the white foam of ocean waves. So there is a beautiful body of water below and sky above. I’m in awe. Then a woman comes into the room. She is an indigenous woman with brown skin. She says, “I was referred to you for healing by some women in my Universal Peace Dance Group.” She lists the women, but I don’t recognize their names as members of my practice. Erin and Sophia. So she lies down on the bed - it’s not a chiropractic or massage table, but an actual bed with blankets and pillows. We don’t discuss her history or any of her concerns. I just start working with her and telling her about this work. Her body is responding and moving in a kundalini wave. It’s amazing to witness. Then I notice her hair - it looks like it is growing back from chemotherapy treatments. At the same time, my son is in the kitchen and no one is watching him. He’s playing with the water from the fridge. He’s pouring water into his cup. Then he notices me and comes over.

It may have turned when this other guy showed up, but I don't remember that. I'm on the second floor with the girl. There aren't proper stairs. To get down we go down a weird plywood chute, which has an odd, little, pentagonal opening that is much wider than it is tall, that you have to wiggle into, then you slide down to the first floor. When we get down to the first floor, she doesn't want to leave. I think, okaaayyy... and I leave, leaving her there. After that, I either wake up for real, or I dream that I do, false awakening, and I don't know which it was. Think it was in the dream, because as I lay there, I seemed to hear snatches of music and conversation, and I become obsessed with the idea that there might be somebody in the house.

It was dark outside and these men were moving the body of a younger woman, maybe of Latin descent? She had curly short hair. It was unclear if she was injured or dead. First point of view was from a distance, like from a car across the street, then it just showed them taking her down and out of the building, and restarted inside the building to the second point of view from one of the men moving her. I could see her clothing but not her face, it was vintage late 70’s style. Again, I was just taking her downstairs only thumping her body down each step this time. Then it zoomed out again and it was more of like a removed witness point of view, like I was watching the watcher (the first one). Then I woke up.",

I fly over the parking lots and over the edge of the sea, and at one point a very large glass enclosure. The glass walls are so transparent you can barely see them. A small door way below me. I think I should fly down and go through it. I'm not sure if I'm physical and flying, or out of body. I think, well, I must be non-physical, so rather than descending and going through the door, I just sail right through the glass wall, and then I'm outside again. [?] Never do find my car.

It’s my friend, Carmen, who is hosting. She’s been doing a lot of the teaching. I’ve been in the mix, too. I’m not a participant, but I’m there. I can’t tell if I’m helping out with the retreat or not. She’s giving the ending teaching or wrap up of the retreat to all these women. They’re mostly older women - a little like elders in training - that seems to be the theme of the retreat. She’s giving them a speech, more or less, that’s along the lines of: “Okay, now you women have these tools. Go forth and do your eldering.” I am witnessing this and someone has asked me to go hang out the laundry, which is something I used to do all the time in Hawaii - I used to hang out all of the laundry for our house. We didn’t have a dryer. Then even when I moved to the mainland, in the summertime I would hang out all of the laundry. When I did it as a child, I resented it because it was just another chore I had to do and it was not my clothes, it was everyone else’s clothes - by everyone else, I mean the 9 other people in my family, so there were a lot of clothes. I am out hanging this laundry now for the retreat and I’m feeling frustration and resentment build because I can hear all the women who have been on this retreat and they’re all complaining. I’m thinking, “Did you not learn anything from what we just did?” They’re all holding hands with each other. They’re all in it together, complaining together, and also completely ignoring the fact that I’m hanging out their laundry. Or maybe not ignoring, but more that’s what I should be doing because I’m not an elder. I am so frustrated because all I can see is how seemingly selfish they are and that they don’t have anything to complain about. They're complaining about parts of the retreat and parts of their lives. I get so sick and fed up that I leave  (...)",

They’re pretty solid. The building itself is vast. I don’t even know how deep it goes. So there’s a self-serve area at one end - that’s the end that goes on and on and I don’t know how deep it goes. At the other end that’s open, it has long tables where you can take what you’ve selected and eat there with people. It’s packed. So, the dream opens and I’m sitting at a table. I’m not eating though. I’m waiting for someone that feels like my daughter, but doesn't look like her. She’s an adult. She arrives and we set off for school. So we get in a car and we leave the cafe. We drive down a long road - it’s about a half hour drive and I know this. I know we’re already going to be late. We park the car and walk across the street to the campus which is also really, really vast. There’s outdoor areas, walking paths that are cobblestoned, and then there’s the various buildings themselves on the campus. We walk across the grassy area and crosswalks. We go into a long low building to try to find our classroom. We have a schedule. But the first classroom we go to for our class is empty and we notice on the outside the door that it has moved. This is all making us even later. We go down another hall, around a corner to the left, look at the door numbers and we walk in the first classroom, which has obviously started about a half an hour ago. Despite that, though, the teacher welcomes us. We listen to the lecture. When it’s finished, we go to the room next door. There’s another teacher in there that we’re talking to and discussing our lessons. We realize that he’s trying to undermine the first teacher. We’ve gotten our lunch out and we’re sitting there trying to eat food in this classroom. He keeps kind of telling us the opposite things, so we’re taking mental notes with this. He finally leaves.

She’s in another room doing this meeting. She calls me in and we continue consulting with the client. She asks me where I got the outfit I’m wearing. I say, “This is the fabric you gave me. I turned it into a skirt and top.” It feels good between us - she’s my friend and my boss. We’re having a good time and I’m really enjoying working with her. Then the scene evolves a little bit. We’re in the same house area, but now it’s my house. We’ve completed our work and she leaves. I’m realizing there’s really weird stuff happening outside. I get it in my head that I want to call my ex-father-in-law who owns the mortgage on my house (this is actually true in real life as well). Because weird things are happening, I want to call and say, “Hey, there’s a freeze on all mortgages and rent, so I’m not going to get it to you this month.” I’m on the phone talking to him and I've gone outside. It’s a little bit dark and ominous. It is nighttime. A wind has picked up. I’m talking with him on the phone. There is no hello or anything; I haven’t even gotten out the words to ask him about the freeze. He says, “I haven’t received your rent check this month. And I’ve heard that there’s a drone outside your house and I’m a little bit confused.” He’s starting to fade out like the connection is bad and I can’t hear him anymore.

It was a third house, in addition to the two that are present in reality between the Levine's and my childhood home. For some reason I go to the Levine's house and let myself in. I'm confused. I don't remember where I've been staying. I don't remember where I'd gone, or where I was to come back to. The door is unlocked. Nobody seems to be in. I go down to the basement, Lindsey Levine is there. She's not upset, or even surprised to see me, and is quite pleasant. I'm a very young man. We have a conversation that begins to be very promising. She says that chardonnay was a barrier between her and other people. I say, I was having kind of memory lapse and was concerned. It was apparent that I wasn't staying at the Levine's, because the downstairs wasn't arranged the way I'd had it in this other house. Some other lady pulls up. Somehow the basement is open to the street. This lady is a friend of Lindsey's and has all the social graces. They get to chatting, and there is no return to the conversation I was having with Lindsey. I'm disappointed. Then, a mall. Some kind of conference going on. In the beginning of it I'm there with John Levine. I tell him I'd had this conversation with his mother and that she had been a constructive influence. He is approving, and says something like, yep, that's mom. For a while I'm watching a movie at this conference in a room with a large number of other people. I'm in an aisle seat.

I’m filing for unemployment and looking for support. While I’m inside, I look out the window at my car. My car is a convertible and the top is off. A man is sitting in the passenger seat. He’s scruffy and older looking of mixed ethnicity - at one point he seems Chinese and another African. I make a move towards the car to tell him to get out, but then he slides a gun across his lap and points it toward me. The gun is upside down and pointed at me as a warning to stay back. So I don't say anything to him. I go back inside and a woman notices that I’m disturbed. She asks me about it, but she can do nothing to help me. So I’m at a loss. The dream shifts to the next day at the same time. I’m waiting for help. He happens to be inside, too. The woman who I spoke with yesterday comes out and apologizes to me that we are here at the same time and that he could be near me. I say, “Don’t worry about it, it’s okay. He doesn’t seem to be threatening today.” I notice that he’s just standing there, leaning against a wall, trying to get help, too. Then I wander around. At the back, there is an outdoor patio and some of my friends are there. One of my friends suggests we have a glass of wine. So we go to order wine. There are so many choices, but no menu. So we have to guess and give words to the man serving the wine, describing the taste profile or experience we desire. He pulls out a bag of sarsaparilla and cloves and holds it open for us to smell. We enjoy the smell and he gives us a mason jar of red wine that has this flavor profile. While he’s serving us, he tells us that he used to have a job that paid $35/hour and he misses that regular pay because now he is just living on tips. We thank him and each pay him $5 for the wine and $1 tip. He says again, “I still wish I had that job where I was getting paid 35 a month.” I think, “Hmm a month? D (...)",

I’ve also put on a skirt to cover up the black bottoms, but the bottoms are black and the skirt is an almost see-through light pink, so you can still see the bottoms.

There were no emotions as I was looking out at all different kinds of settings and landscapes, like I was passing through but didn’t belong. There were no people in it. It was all nighttime and dark and quiet. At some point, just before I woke up, that’s when I realized I was cataloging things through my eye. I started to realize there was a human part of me that realized I was cyborg. That’s when the creepy feeling started coming in about not feeling anything. Then I woke up. I couldn’t shake the creepy feeling of not having emotions. It just carried through like wiry air that was empty of something.",

I was still a teacher. And somehow while I'm in the waiting room, I plug it into the hospital's network (?) and there he is on the screen. We watch the procedure. The point of view is that of someone down by Friedrich's feet. Friedrich's dick is erect, but I couldn't see what they were doing to it. Some black knobby things were attached to his dick, and it had to be hard for the procedure, I guess. I'd also loaded a whole bunch of porn on the tablet, and I thought to myself that that wasn't so smart, as it belonged to the school. But, they'd issued it to me, and there was no indication they'd ever want it back, at least for a very long time. Then the procedure is over, and Friedrich comes out. I tell him I'd watched it. He's a little nonplussed, but nothing serious,. Talking about what they had done. There hadn't been any cutting, and no anesthetic used, no idea what they had done. Don't think in the dream I knew, either. But then he says something and I gather that he had had some adhesions, and he verifies that, but that would have involved cutting.... I say, it'll be great to have those dealt with. He agrees. I add, Have fun, buddy.",

The dream is concerned with trying to get dressed for it, which takes a long time. I have a bunch of tan, corduroy pants and some shirts I'd been keeping at school or stored somewhere, that I'd completely forgotten about. I'm extremely surprised when I put on one of the pants and it fits. But the clasp is shot, and there's some kind of weird contrivance instead of a button to keep the pants from falling down, involving some metal rod that was sharp. Anyhow I get the pants on, and a shirt, with buttons down the front. And a lot of nonsense with a pair of socks. There's an eight or nine year old girl there. Her parents have some kind of company, and she's at the Bush school, as are several other girls, who keep coming in and out while I'm trying to get these socks on. It's a $60 pair of socks, I find out from the girl's mom, who comes in at one point. The socks are from their company. A part of my mind finds it bizarre that I'm hanging out with these children of the elite. The socks are knee-high and had some kind of Jewish motifs on them. I think that is cool. Jewish socks, yay! I finally go to the party, and it all seems trivial. A lot of people standing around talking. Some guy buttonholes me, no idea who he is. Wants to talk about some book that weighed forty pounds and cost five dollars. An exhaustive compendia of trivialities or some kind or other. I didn't quite catch what it was all about, but he's excited and wants to tell me all about it. I'm like, uhhh.....",

There’s a plane I'm needing to catch and of course I’m late. I am wearing all black and this is significant because where I’m going I’m supposed to be wearing all black - I don’t know if it’s because it’s a professional thing or what. We get to the airport. I’m trying to rush through security and rush through the check-in. My parents are sort of with me and also the ones providing the ticket - at least they’re supposed to have the ticket in their hands. I get through security and up to the counter, and the ticket is lost. It’s interesting because I’m seeing what looks like a little black swirl that has some substance and I see it float off to my left. I think, “Oh shit, there goes my ticket. I needed that.” So we're back up at the counter and trying to tell the agent that the ticket has been lost. But I’m not the only one. A lot of other people are also having trouble getting their tickets and getting onto this plane. At this point my parents fade out of the dream. Now I can see the plane on the tarmac through the big windows. It’s ready for us and we all need to get on it, but we don’t have our tickets or something is preventing us from getting on. The dream totally shifts from being serious where things are a little dark and dingy and I'm all in black. Now when I look out the windows onto the tarmac, the plane is this big cartoonish plane. It’s proportions are not correct - it’s really, really tall but really stubby. There’s these round stuffies - I think they’re cats that are alive but look like stuffed animals - being shoved into the back of the plane. Now the plane looks like a cargo plane and the back door is open instead of having two doors open like we’d walk down a jetway into it. It’s just got the cargo bay open.

I’m in an apartment that is similar to an apartment I lived in on the top floor of a house on Windermere and Beach Blvd on the shores of Lake Ontario, although it doesn’t look the same inside. We are temporary visitors. We’re staying with another friend of mine because we need to be there - something’s going on and we can’t go home. We’ve been displaced. My friend is from the sail club and owns the apartment. He isn’t home when we get there, although we knew that. He’s told us it’s okay to go in and do what we need to do to make our dinner and stuff. We don’t need to wait for him. So we go in. It's my son and I this time. First we just rest on the couch. Then we get some water and rest again. Then it starts to get dusk. We’re hungry. There’s some confusion about whether or not we’re supposed to wait for him at this point or help ourselves to things that are in the fridge or go out and get food. We don’t have any food with us and we don’t know where to get food. So we end up waiting. We eat a few small things we found in his fridge. When he gets there he says to go out and pick up Thai food. He has already got some leftovers in the fridge that he’s going to eat, but he tells us where to go to get the Thai food. So we leave the apartment, go down into the street, and then there’s this complex labyrinth of alleyways and doorways to go through. But he’s given us really clear instructions. We go in the first building and there’s an internal door in the building. We have to find it. We do. We go through that door. It takes us into a residence, but it’s just a long rectangular room and they’re used to people going through. The door is at the top of the rectangle. We go through. They kind of give us the nod and we keep going. As we exit out the other door, there’s a turnstyle. There’s 1 of 4 directions we can go in and we have to turn and kind of go to the right, like a traffic circle, but you take the first exit. So we do this. (...)",

Not a thing for saying goodbye, it was just her last party. Details forgotten. Some kind of long, low building, ended up at one end of it where there was a big, semicircular bar that wrapped around, big glass windows. Not open yet. somebody was working on it. A bar or nightclub. A cruise ship, or something like one. Instead of going the main way out (?) there's a steep and narrow companionway, all bright metal, shiny and new. A railing, then open below the railing, with stanchions. Goes up and joins another walkway, but instead of there being an opening or gate to let you into this upper walkway, there is none. So you have to clamber up and over the barrier, which is a little more than waist high. Very awkward. Some guy there I interacted with. Margaret, a long bit. We're in some kind of nightclub? Very late. We're talking. She's broken up with her boyfriend who isn't anyone from real life. She's not upset. We're watching these girls wrestle, fully clothed in street clothes. It's like a party. They're in a little arena. One is much bigger than the other, and repeatedly throws the smaller one, who is giggly and seems not at all to mind? I ask Margaret what she's going to do tomorrow, and she's getting together with somebody, parental type, but paradoxically neither Danielle nor me, but it was her parents. Other parents? I say I was going to call you tomorrow, but... All low key and no big. Finally I get up to go. Margaret is leaning back against a barrier that was on the ground and when I get up to go she goes around the barrier., as we were at the end of it, and here's this English guy, like a rocker. He smiles at me and waves. Margaret is going to hang out with him. It's on the Centerville waterfront and \"Im gloating along. I'm going to go along the seawall there on Alaskan Way.",

At one point there was a car, like a zip car. You get in and do something with your smart phone and drive. So Margaret is driving, and I'm in the back seat. And there's a baby in a baby carrier in the front. I say, Margaret, this car wasn't free for us to use! Somebody left their baby in it while they went in a store, or something. This is not good! They'll have called the cops by now. So she drives back and there are no repercussions. This was part of some longer saga that is forgotten. At one point we're sitting, perhaps in an outdoor cafe. It's getting dark on a summer evening, and some young man has a back pack, on the back of which is a screen showing his blog or something. I think to myself, this is what people do now. I could never do that, but I also think maybe I should? No, I can't... I say to someone, Margaret and I have incarnated together hundreds of times.... I'm in a Swedish city. Eventually I lose track of Margaret. There's a steam bath. I'm not really trying to go into it. In the foyer. Some big, shiny corporate building, I never see the outside. The foyer is tiled in patterns of various shades of blue, very pleasing, tiles are small, maybe 1\" square, like a mosaic. I'm trying to leave, but the more I try to leave, the more I find myself deeper inside. At first there are showers, modern freestanding sculptures in the showers, so it's a combination art gallery. But then it's more of a steam bath, men and boys in there. The boys are all soaped up. I'm still wearing all my clothes, and I'm feeling overdressed. It's steamy in there. You can't see everything clearly. A group of pre-pubescent boys standing around, couple of them their dicks are hard, but their not really doing much of anything except giggling, perhaps.

We’re searching for a place and we find a coffee shop that’s opened. It turns out that my friend Anna is working there. She does some of the coffee and baking on the side, but she’s actually an artist and makes beautiful jewelry and gorgeous leather handmade bags that she tools and paints. Her studio is part of this coffee place - it’s a room off to the side. I’m so happy to see her. She’s such a beautiful soul. And she’s so happy to see me.

The set up is we’re all on the top floor - I don’t even know what’s in the basement. The top floor of the house as you come up the stairs at one end from the main floor is a sitting room. As you walk from that door, you go through the kitchen and you keep walking through the kitchen, you come to an eating area - dining room. Then straight ahead of the eating room are a few bedrooms. The doors are closed; we don’t see them in the dream. Off to the left is an upper floor sun room that has chairs in it and a lot of windows. The whole upstairs feels worn - the floors dip in the middle and there’s the old kind of linoleum tile that curls up at the edges of each square. The windows have a film of dust and age. The paint has dulled. The paint is chipped on the frames around the doors and you can see the wood through it. Dust has stuck to the cupboards in the kitchen and they look a little greasy. The furniture is all old and of poor quality. It’s full of people. The dream begins where I’m gathered with some people around a table in the eating area. We’ve divided up a number of tasks we have to complete. One of those persons is my yoga teacher from my teacher training. He seems to be in charge of it and is assigning tasks. Everyone is listening to him. So we’re divided up into groups of two or three people and we go down. I don’t see the stairs as we go down, but I’m just suddenly outside of the house on the sidewalk and in the street. In the dream, there’s no time devoted to the journey of going in and out of each store to pick up what we’re supposed to. I just know that we’ve done it. We’re back in the meeting place with our bags. They’re not a lot of bags. They also show signs of poor quality and age. We each only have two or three items in our bag.

As I lay down and got comfortable, I noticed that I was entering a very vivid and spiritual head space. I was thinking about the spiritual decisions that I had made lately, and as I pondered, I began to see the smiling faces of unknown people drift before my eyes. One was a young girl, another a middle-aged woman. I took this as a sign that I had made the right decision, but then, the face of an older man with white shoulder length hair, a beard, and mustache came to rest in my field of vision. I asked him why he wasn't smiling and he said that he wasn't smiling because I was smiling. His point was that the fact that I was happy about my decision didn't make it the right decision.  I found myself in outerspace orbiting a desert planet. I zoomed in and standing on a cliff was an older Spock, though with more Romulen than Vulcan features. He was shouting at me and flailing his limbs as if to ward me off. His shouts were completely silent.  I zoomed away backwards from the planet and then found that I was a servant at a manor. A family was there, and at this point in my reverie, I was sufficiently drowsy to not be sure of my own identity. I didn't know who I was in the dream and was getting worried that I wouldn't be able to escape or find myself again. In the manor, I was in the kitchen where an old man was baking a cake. One of us held the cake in a circular metal dish before placing it into or removing it from the oven. The oven was stone with an arched door. I came to the realization that the old man was the real me and that everything was going to be fine because he was in control and had given me permission to go on my vision quest.   I walked down a passageway and the dream began to lose any narrative coherence. I began to see images of faces flash before my eyes. I remember seeing Doug's face clearly.",

I order it, and then find out it's $65, and I say, no, that's too much. So I look for something else to order, but never actually get around to ordering anything else. A part where I walked out to get some air, out the front and around to the left, and to the back, where there are several steam-powered contraptions, quite intricate and interesting, One is fired up and running and emitting steam. I can't figure out the purpose of them. I finally decide they must be agricultural machinery of some kind, but can't figure out the specific application.

She was probably doing her best. I’m in her house. That was my hanai family, too, when I was in the islands, so I spent a lot of time at their house - way more time at their house than my house in my teenage years. So, I’m at her house, which I don’t recognize, it looks different. Her husband, Uncle Jay, is there - he was also my kumu and hanai family. They’re talking to me about planning how they’re going to remodel parts of their house and how it’s going to cost them money, but they finally have money for it, or someone is giving them money or they’re going to earn it. I’m there with kumu and her son who is also in the dream at his younger age (when I knew them, he was 4-8, so he’s one of those ages). They’re showing me how they’re going to do it. They’re really, really friendly - it’s now how I remember it when I left the halau. They are just trying to show me there’s different ways. I’m making plans for the next day and kumu actually says, “Well, come back, be here with me and help me work in the store.” So I guess she owns a clothing store and I have an option of helping her. We finish talking and I go to my room in this house. Another friend calls an (...)",

It’s a place for healing through sex. The person bankrolling it reminds me of Hugh Heffner because it’s gigantic, but there’s so so so much money. Everything is so nice. There’s a part where people come in, rent a room and stay there. Then there’s also the part where basically the sex workers live and work. That part is three stories high and it’s amazing watching it be built. It’s so high up. I’m watching these panels get put on. There’s another part of the building that is a really tall tower and the lower part of the complex which is just one story has all kinds of amazing amenities in it. So the sex workers, we all live and work in that really tall part of the building. It’s like a classroom, so people come up there and are taught all kinds of things - whatever they want to learn and find out about. There’s aso major healing of trauma happening thorugh sex with people coming back into their bodies, unwinding childhood molestations. I’m one of the sex workers who is also learning more skills - it’s kind of like you can attend workshops there, too, and get more skills. So I’m there and this guy that I’ve just read about in real life, King Noire, is there and showing me the ropes. It is the best time ever because you’re learning all about sex, so how is that bad? So, I can feel myself becoming an expert at it, so time is passing in the dream in the way it does where it’s sort of seamless. Somebody I know from the pole studio - she used to be a pole instructor, but also the coordinator - comes to the third story. She’s sort of a guest sex worker who we haven’t seen in a while.

I was to get everything ready to leave as we were going to have to go far away. Somehow I knew that some bad men were coming and the police were going to come, too. I realized in the dream that I’ve been in the dream before somehow- dreamed about the same situation. I knew that the man that I had been with on the phone had done some terrible things. I said, “you’ve killed people!” to him! I was flooded with images of people coming to the door and bodies and bleach. In the dream I knew about it but I was scared. I knew I didn’t do anything wrong but I had not told the police about him so I was going to get in trouble as well. I was worried and protective about this child on my hip.

I had put on them, each one was different, cryptic, fairly complex, mostly rectilinear symbols that covered perhaps half of the surface at most. There was a strange, spooky woman who was way down at the end, who passes twice. She wears a red, strapless dress that goes down to just above her knees. somewhat tight fitting. Each time she passes I am in a different location. I'm closer to where she comes from on the second pass. The first time she passes we have some kind of interaction. She's very creepy. Not necessarily destructive, but different, creepy, possibly not fully human. She gave me some instruction or prophecy, or something. On her second pass she doesn't notice me. A second woman follows her that second time, who seems more normal. Then I spend time with several different groups of artists. In one I assemble a group of young men. Mexican, black hair, quite powerfully built. Not stocky, but amply muscled. Blue jeans, loose shirts of various colors. I'd assembled them. Much forgotten. A couple other scenarios.

I see a playground and a cafeteria or place you can eat where they sell the shitty food you’d find in parks - ice cream cones and corn dogs. There’s another building on the left hand side of the road with the big open field or meadow. The building is on the end of the field. The road goes down and stops at this huge wide river.

She's okay with that, but she questions whether I'm really capable of doing it any more. I say I've been taking classes for years just for the sake of interest, and so far it's worked out okay. But then I say, referring to how I'd lost the binder a second time, this is what I'm up against.

The chairs have mossy soft green cushions and the place settings are lovely - silver and cream with gold, soft green napkins. There is a fireplace with antlers on the mantel.

I saw her at a coffee shop patio in Santa Monica and she was with some older male friends (like late 40s). They invited me to sit and I didn’t want to, I wanted to go read in the sun but didn’t want to be rude. I was nervous the men wanted to flirt with me or make moves on me. One guy was signing copies of his book and tossed me his card and signed a book for me. I didn’t ask for one. Then he showed it to me, lots of foldout pages, maps and legends, tracking history of immigration of his people. I told him I wanted to do the same thing for filipino diaspora. I was actually pretty excited and wanted to connect with them/hangout. I felt nervous and insecure and untrusting and then excited and insecure and untrusting. Lots of anxiety and the feeling of wanting to be alone.",

It’s very unlike me. We are wandering through a park. There’s not a lot of people. It feels like people are in quarantine. There is a group of people that are gathered and they’re listening to music. There are maybe 10 or 15 of them inside of a tent - one of those white event tents and the musicians are in the front. My group with the guru go towards the tent - there's another section of the tent that’s been walled off and private and we’re heading there. When I get up to the group of people, I see a bunch of people I know. One of them is Maria. I see her and I’m like, “Oh my gosh! Hi!” She looks at me and is like, “Hi.” What’s really interesting is her face is really round and chubby. It’s her but her face is swollen or she’s gotten really fat but only from the jaw up. It’s a bit weird. I’m happy to see her but remembering that things did not end well with us. She’s looking at me and has a look on her face - I can tell that she’s trying to apologize. She wants to say something along the lines of, “I’m sorry things ended the way they did.” As I’m talking with her, the guru and some of the other group that I’m a part of (it feels like an open relationship type of situation, but not really because the guru is in charge and the rest of us are like satellites that are with him) are mad that I’m talking with Maria. The guru doesn’t want me to talk with her because I’m still feeling a connection with her. She’s obviously feeling remorseful about the way things ended. I can see that she’s trying to make an apology. I’m sitting down. Maria and I are sitting on these 3-legged stools talking to each other. One of the other people from the guru group comes up to me and tapes a stone onto my wrist. It’s clear scotch tape and the stone is very flat, no bigger than 2 inches long and maybe a quarter (...)",

It’s nighttime and I’m sitting at a table and there’s a single candle lit. A couple of my brothers are around and we have either just gathered for dinner or we’re gathering for dinner. We have a conversation, but I do not recall it. The feeling sense it left in me is that there was some discordance. The dream shifts and now I’m in a factory, sort of, like a production place - things are being done here. It reminds me of where I do stocking at the grocery store - there’s always stuff coming in and has to be put away and shelved and whatnot. There’s a walk-in freezer in this place we’re in and there’s stuff being prepared. There’s also a kitchen where stuff is being prepared. There’s a lot of making and preparation going on. It seems that the crew is mostly male from what I can tell. Some of them are people I know, some not. One is a server I used to work with named Sam. Another one is someone I work with at the grocery store - his name is Aaron. So those two are there and I recognize and know them. And Gandolf from “Lord of the Rings” is floating around. I don’t think he’s overseeing anything; his presence is just kind of there in the mix. It reminds me of Gandolf or Merlin. So the pace is a little bit frenetic. I feel incredibly out of place in this warehouse. No one has given me a job. They just said something around the lines of, “You’re on this crew. Now go help.” I don’t know exactly what to do, and it feels like every single one of my efforts is wasted because somebody else has already done the task that I’m doing or I’m not doing it correctly and somebody else has to come behind me and redo the task. I’m seeing butchers cutting meat and we are selling turkeys that need to be brined, so we are brining tur (...)",

I get the sense it’s on an island. In real life, I’ve been to St. Lucia which is a volcanic island, and although it doesn’t look like St. Lucia, it has the feel of a volcanic island. I think that’s where I am. It’s definitely the ocean - the waters are that aquamarine, crystal clear and you can feel its vastness. The sun is shining brightly and it’s ricocheting off the water. It’s so beautiful. There’s a pale sandy shore, it’s not white, it’s just pale. You can also see that the sunlight is refracting from the individual grains of sand. We are each in our seaside community, scurrying around, gathering things. Some people are gathering shells in these wide baskets which have been woven out of some kind of frond. I seem to be circulating in between groups of people. I feel like I’m counting something. I’m taking stock or tallying. As I approach each person or small group, some people are collecting by themselves and others are gathering in pairs, maybe a group of three but no more than three people. As I approach each single person or small group, they hold out and show me what they've got, I become the watcher. I’m way up - my perspective is pulled back as though I’m a bird in the sky and I’m looking down on our small island and our community of people. Then I zoom back in and I become me in my body again and people show me what they’ve got. I don’t really remember what people were showing me. But I remember the person that had the shells and I had some kind of conversation about the shells - what kind they were and how many and what we could do with them or trade with these shells. I remember another man telling me that he found some new place to find food and he brought a few samples. All I remember now is continually pulling back from the group, becoming the bird’s eye view, the watcher and  (...)",

The siblings who grew up in this house have returned at the invitation of the fifth sibling who was the outcast and made fun of for her whole life. We are all in an attic bedroom they shared growing up. I’m with her in her bed - I’m not sure if I am her or an invited guest/witness/support person. It is night at the beginning of the dream. She puts on a nightmare for all of them so they see and feel the torture she experienced growing up. They wake up horrified and near death if not dead. There are ghosts in the house and it is creepy even in the morning. Morning usually dispels the fear of night, but it is grey and gloomy. There is no real natural or electric sources of light. I recall looking into a mirror and not seeing a reflection. The dream shifts. I’m standing in line at a cafe known for its sausage rolls. We’ve heard wonderful things about it. I’m with Gail, Veronica and Irene - my “Moon Sisters” who I’ve gathered with on the Monday closest to the New Moon for years and we continue to gather over Zoom weekly. So we want to try these famous sausage rolls. Today they are making the sausage rolls from a gooey yummy blueberry sticky bun style muffin. It looks mouthwatering delicious! But, there is a sinister quality - if you eat it, part of you will dissolve from the inside. So it’s a dangerous treat to indulge in. We all want one anyway. There isn’t one left for me or it’s too expensive, but Gail offers to share hers with me. We sit at the table and are okay when we enjoy it together.",

The shoes I was wearing are actually a pair of shoes I own - they’re sandals with black bottoms and fake black, white and grey snakeskin straps. I took them off to go do something. I don’t know if I was going to dance or what. They disappear - they went missing. I went to go do something else for a little bit. But then I remembered that I needed to put shoes on and I really liked those sandals, so I went back to the bleachers to go find them. They weren’t there. All of a sudden, there’s rows and rows and racks of shoes, like you’d see in a shoe store or Ross or someplace. I am going through all of these shoes trying to find my sandals and my sandals are nowhere to be found. Someone had pointed out - “hey go look over there, there’s all these shoes.” There were tons and tons of shoes, even some cute shoes I would have liked. But I couldn't find mine and I just wanted to really find my shoes and I couldn’t progress through the dream if I didn’t find them. And I didn’t.",

In front of one of the windows, entering in the room, is a closet - it is not a very big one. It has two bars on either side of it with clothes hanging on. It’s probably about 7 feet from the internal door of the closet to the window. I can see the window outside of the closet. It’s almost like the closet, if you look right at it is a closet with solid walls; but when I’m in bed, I can see what’s outside of the window - both of them at the same time. So it’s almost like the walls have color and appear to be dense, yet I can see through them. The dream starts with me going to bed and I wake up in the middle of the night. I can see there’s something terrible - something I’m afraid of - outside of the window. I’m afraid to move in my bed. I don’t go back to sleep and I stay there until the morning. The day just passes in a blur. Then I go back to bed and again, I’m trying to go to sleep, but I’m awake because I know that thing is going to come back and it’s going to be outside my window again. In fact, I start to realize that it’s always outside of the window. Then, as I’m lying in bed awake, I start to get a little bit curious about what exactly it is outside of the window. So I get out of my bed and I open the door and I peek into the closet. Nothing happens yet. So I open the door a little wider and I go a little bit more into the closet. Now I’m just standing in the closet. I can feel its presence through the window pane. I’m just standing there. As I’m standing there, my ex-husband comes into the room. He starts making noise and stuff. I say, “What are you doing in here? Please stop.” He ignores me and comes into the closet. He says, “I have to get a shirt.” I tell him to stop, “Stop doing that, you’re going to disturb it.” But he doesn’t. Then the thing starts to come closer to the window. Then I re (...)",

I don’t remember what the name was, but it was crazy long. There was a very antique’y poetic way of asking me out and his contact information was in the book.

The living accommodations are all quite disappointing and dilapidated. The mattress is old, flat, sagging and overused with broken springs and mold. The paint is peeling on the windowsill and the whole place feels like it’s falling apart. The shared bathroom is absolutely disgusting.

The people in the other workshop have left these grey innertube style structures over the bathtubs and toilets - the toilets look like big chairs. There’s nothing I can do about it because the other people were supposed to take care of their stuff. In another scene, I’m getting dressed with a group of women. Ella (from my priestess studies) is looking through my closet to help me choose an outfit to go to the dance club. She wants to find a floral drape she gave me years ago, but doesn’t know I got rid of it. She chooses a floral top for herself. I tell her it won’t fit her and she holds it against her body, and it’s clear to all of us except her that it’s too small. She thinks I’m being selfish rather than honest. My outfit is denim shorts with layered and fitted floral tops and a long necklace with a clear crystal at the end. The necklace hangs down between my thighs and I find it just very odd and uncomfortable. There’s another scene where I’m waiting at a studio to take yoga or dance.

We have a dog together and we’re outside somewhere that’s part of the race. There's bikers going by. But there’s also this very strange element - they’re calling them land sharks. But they look nothing like sharks. They look like oversized pigs, actually. The snouts are really elongated and look like the front of a shark. They have four legs. Their bodies are pretty wide and tall. So I’m watching these bikers bike their race and these land sharks keep showing up and are the same size as the bikers.

It’s quite a hike, but that’s not unusual for me. I like to walk. The walk takes about an hour. It’s just straight up a street, block after block, tree lined and very pretty. It’s a small town. It’s like walking up Cathedral Avenue in BC with huge trees that form an umbrella - they reach toward each other overtop. So I don’t even feel the rain. It’s raining out, but I’m not feeling it on my body or my face. I’m not getting wet. I arrive at the place where the lecture is and it’s a house. I realize that it’s the house of my professor, M.M. So, I walk up to the side and knock on the door and she answers it. The door opens out into her kitchen. She’s happy to see me, though we don’t hug. We stand about 6 feet apart, respecting social distancing. There's several other people in the kitchen and they're all in some kind of process of removing outer clothing and hanging it up on hooks. Then we go down the hall from the kitchen, into an enormous university style lecture hall where there’s theatre seats and a stage. At this point, M.M. disappears and I realize that the lecture is not on the psychology topic I thought it was on, but it’s two men who are standing there and they’re kind of counting the number of people that they have. I can overhear their conversation. They’re saying that they thought there’d be more than this. But, “this is a good turnout anyway and let’s hope we can sell it.” I think, “Oh, man, I’m not here to buy anything,” and I’m disappointed. So the two men walk down the aisle towards the stage. They don’t even mount the stage yet, when people start leaving. Then the one man stands to the side and the other one gets up and stands behind the podium and he begins to talk but doesn’t say anything. More and more people are leaving until there’s only 3 or 4 people left. Then he ceases the talk and says, “Well I  (...)",

We are driving past caged animals - wild animals - on both sides. We see elephants on both sides. On one side, the elephants are very calm and we comment on their parasympathetic nature and how unusual it seems in this confined space. The elephants on the other side look thin, agile and strong - there are mothers and calves. Someone who works there opens the gate to allow the animals to move from one side to the other across the road. A beautiful black gazelle leaps past us into a field. We get out of the car and follow the gazelle to see it up close. In the field, we come across two warthogs eating flowers. We’re close to them and someone remarks on how unusual it is to be this close without them charging at us. Then that seems to remind the warthogs of their nature. They lift their heads and start running after us. We run away as fast as we can. There’s a huge brown cow of elephant proportions so we have to run wide so she doesn’t kick us or knock us over with her long tail. Then I see my mom and dad riding a cow like a horse. My mom reaches down to catch my hand and pull me onto their cow. It nearly pulls her and my dad off the back of the cow. The cow is still running, but thankfully they are able to pull me up and we are able to escape. Then the scene shifts. I’m in Costco with my husband. We have an empty cart and we’re in the area where people eat pizza and hot dogs, but no one else is there. I see a sign with my husband’s full name on it.

I don’t like being around him, but we’re there for the kids. The kids are younger in this dream - maybe 6 and 8. It's our daughter's birthday (she is the 8 years old). They’re setting up for a birthday party in this room that doesn’t have a whole lot in it. It’s a simple square room with an ugly brown carpet, not all that big. Her friends are there. It’s like last minute - I wasn’t aware this was happening - so there’s no food, no decorations, nothing. But her friends are beginning to show up. I’m wanting to vacuum the floor, get all the toys off of it. There are a couple cookies getting ground into carpet. I’m also working on a project - I’m doing some sort of hand sewing and it’s in its own project bag on the middle of the floor. This is all stuff I’m trying to vacuum up and pick up before her friends arrive, so we can set up tables and whatnot. But everyone ends up coming before I can complete the vacuuming and before I can pick up the handwork I’m doing. My ex just starts setting up tables and putting out food. It’s the grossest premade food you buy at a deli from Safeway - no nutritional value. I’m horrified because I would never feed that to my kids, but that’s what he’s got and that’s what the kids are eating. They are playing and having a good time and eating this food that is so not nourishing and gross. Then the dream shifts a little, the party ends and we are taking the kids somewhere. We’re in a van - one of those Astro vans - it’s brown. I’m observing the van driving and I see it hit a rock. We’ve veered out of the lanes on the highway and hit some rocks on the side. So I have no idea where our destination was, but now we’re pulled over and we need some help. We’re kind of out in the boonies - it’s like sagebrush and open sky and not a whole lot of houses or anything. Somehow, somebody shows up. It’s a cowboy look (...)",

There are other vessels that have also been crafted and will be used in the ocean, possibly for a race or competition. Then I am having lunch with a wealthy and well-connected couple. We are waiting for their son because they want us to meet. They think we will really hit it off. He arrives and there is an immediate attraction between us. The attraction is flirtatious and easy and a wonderful sense of finding somebody new with a very physical and soulful connection. We are looking forward to seeing each other again in the evening before he has to leave the next day. So there’s a sense of urgency and depth, along with loss. I leave the lunch and go shopping for clothes with my mom. It’s very busy, like a mall store, with young women sorting through clothes. I’m distracted, so she goes along with a laundry hamper style basket and fills it with different clothes, a huge variety. While I’m perusing through clothes, I see a couple young women recieve devices like you would get at a restaurant to light up and buzz when your table is ready. They go to the changing rooms in the back. After a while, they return the devices, because they were waiting too long and needed to go. Then somehow I just slip into a changing room in front of a bunch of other people because I don’t have clothes in my arms. Then my mom brings me the basket of clothes, pushing it under the door. They are all different styles and I try them all on. They’re all great and I love them all. I’m surprised about this. My son is on the outside waiting with her. At the bottom of the basket are two stuffed animals - one is a duck with two heads - one on top and one on bottom, the other is a frog or turtle book.

There is a black man and his two daughters. He is showing them how to ride trains for free because they’re really poor and they don’t have money for a ticket. So he showed them how to get on these subway trains for free and ride where you need to ride it. They’re riding on the outside of the train. His daughters are maybe 9 and 11 or maybe 11 or 14. I’m watching them. I’m not even on the train. I’m watching from outside the train. This train is underground, kind of like a subway because there are walls around it and me. They’re on this train and it’s going in one direction. They are on a trip and traveling cross-country. But his daughters get very fearless and bold. They decide to do train hopping and take what he’s taught them and get on any train they want. Sure enough, they’re on this train and they see another train passing them and going in the opposite direction. They were heading one direction because they were heading across the country and then the daughters hop trains and the father is upset. He says, “Hey don’t do that, now we’re going in the wrong direction plus you could kill yourselves.” But it’s too late. The daughters are already on another train, so he has to hop it and get on with them, so he doesn’t lose them. So he gets on this other train. Now they go from being on top of the train down inside the train where there’s other people. There are all kinds of other people on this train. All kinds of ethnicities, races. It’s a mix of white, black, Asian, Indian, Pacific Islander - everybody and all kinds. They’re all quirky people. They have their own idiosyncrasies. They’re each working through some sort of story - they’re living their own personal story out on this train and they’re kind of interacting with each other, but it’s more like they’re bouncing off of each other.

There was an old dog bed that did not match the dog in the picture on the counter. I felt sad. There was a peanut butter jar, and I had a taste and threw away the knife and this made the group tell me (they spoke to me as one, not as individuals): “that was a rookie mistake!” But it was not friendly. It was immediately safe but also dangerous, and I could not stay. I did not fit with them. I went to the back of the house and down to a small restaurant. There was a Jacuzzi with a lock on it.

I don’t want to be here?” I look and it’s like zombies, a sea of them, to try and get out the front door. While I'm strategizing how I’m going to leave, I notice there’s a baby in the crowd of people in the kitchen. No one is holding it. It’s just suspended or squished between people. It’s wearing a diaper and nothing else. I look around and find my ex and sya, “Do you know why that baby is there? Does that baby belong to anyone?” He says, “Yeah, I found it yesterday and brought it home.” I think to myself and am about to say, “Well, why aren’t you looking after it?” Then I realize, of course you're not looking after it, you brought it home to get attention, so people will think you’re a hero. But you’re not really looking after it. So I sigh and am resigned to thinking, “I’ll just sit here and watch to see if anyone is going to look after it before I leave.” Some time passes, an hour or two. The baby is crying. No one is looking after it. So I pluck it from the kitchen and I put it in my lap and soothe it. Then I look around to see if there’s anything I can possibly feed this child. I find my ex again and ask: “Do you have anything to feed the baby?” He says no. I say: “Do you have any diapers because it needs to be changed?” He says no. Then I’m holding the baby. I set it down on top of the kitchen table for a second. I’m scanning the room to see if I see any other women that look like they might possibly have something I can use for this baby. A young man, probably in his early twenties comes through the front door and into the kitchen but can’t get any farther because there’s too many people. He’s got a broom handle without the broom on the end and it has a white rubber end on it. He tucks it up under his arm and aims it at the baby as though he’s going to shoot it.

I had just realized this and was trying to explain the idea to my dad. It was something that I realized Grandpa P. had written in his book. I knew my dad would think this was nonsense even as I began to articulate the idea. In my mind's eye, I could see the waves rippling across the landscape and could feel that it was trying to tell me something.

I took a spoon (or maybe my hand) and smashed it into pieces which scattered across the floor.   After this, I spoke to my dad about the danger of both angels and demons.

It was sunny and warm, though there the trees around the clearing provided more shade than usual because of how close together they were growing and their dense foliage. Many of the trees were dead, and while I wanted to live in this house, my parents told me on the phone (as I had called them on my cell-phone) that it wouldn't be safe to live there. I was looking up at the canopy trying to determine if it would be safe enough. I thought I might be able to clear out some of the deader trees.   Entering the yard of the house, it was a bit like the outside of an amusement park. There was a gate where we entered and had to be registered. There were rides in side and a expanses of concrete ground. It was still a house though, with rooms containing the rides and normal white plaster walls.   Outside in the yard there was a pen in which was our old rabbit Lopsy. I was in the cage and trying to pet her. There were a lot of places where she could easily escape the cage and we assumed she wasn't really being confined.",

The seats have been folded down so we can lie flat. He is naked. I am wearing a sweatshirt, leggings and shoes. They aren’t real leggings because my pelvis is bare. I’m offering my body, but still holding back with reluctance. There is a coldness about him, his body saying, “Nope, I’m done.” I feel fear, despair, total abandonment come over my whole body. In another scene I’m walking into a building with Jack. He is in waking life and in this dream, a relationship counselor. We walk in and look through the window of a door into a classroom. I see three men on yoga mats and a fourth teaching. In the next room, my husband is co-teaching with our friend, Sherry. There is a big group of people doing a practice involving rubbing their knuckles along their foreheads. I’m surprised there are so many people when they were only expecting a few. Jack tells me that the group next door was supposed to have a bigger class, but cut back to only 4, so the remaining people decided to take class with my husband and Sherry. It’s good to see my husband doing his thing and having success in his role as a teacher. Then in another scene, I’m at a wedding ceremony or vow renewal for my husband and me. When it comes time for me to kiss my husband again, he has a basket of papers and a basket of flowers. Other people are around. He pretends to draw me in, but rejects me, turning away at the time of the kiss. There is a sense that I’ve done something horribly wrong and he’s gone now.

I remember it being fall as there were leaves on the ground and there was not much greenery to be seen. It was late afternoon or early evening and the lighting was a bit dim. I hiked for a good ways, came to a good stopping point, and turned around. I hiked back to a gap or clearing where I had left my bike locked to a tree. The bike was a dull orange. As I bent down to unlock it, another hiker came up from the opposite direction and seemed to think that I was stealing the bicycle. He didn't say anything, but I was sure he thought I was taking it. I fumbled slightly with the lock, but managed to unlock it. I began riding the bike out of the clearing. The trail began to rise and ahead of me I saw that some kids were running toward me. I pulled my bike off to the side of the trail to let them past. One of them ran past, and I saw his dad and brother ahead. The first boy either had a water bottle, or had dropped one and was retrieving it. I smiled at them and was overjoyed to see a family out enjoying the outdoors together. I spoke briefly with the father and then kept on my way. I got to the end of my journey and called an Uber to pick me up. He showed up in a shiny black sedan. He was also black. When I got into the backseat of the car, he told me that the ride was going to cost $2,000. I was shocked and we both agreed that it must be a mistake. He told me that he'd correct it. We drove off onto a highway, taking an exit numbered 5. We were in a large, grey, metallic city. It was not a happy place.",

The go-kart was partly powered by an engine and partly by pedal. When you pedaled, the go-kart engine would engage and help you out, but it was still the case that the harder you pedaled the faster you would go, so if you wanted to really zip you had to put forth some effort. I was in the woods by the park and climbing up the dunes that are by the old lake bed. I had to pedal hard to get up the sides of the dunes without slipping back down. When I had gotten to the top (maybe?) I found myself in a completely alien world. It was a massive expanse of desert where the sandy clay substrate was a dull reddish orange--the color of clay.   There was no sign of flora or fauna, but I could see my dad in the distance working with one or two fellow researchers. They didn't seem particularly surprised to see me. When I was within a stones-throw away, I got out and began walking closer. There were baseballs lying around and it was clear that a game of catch had been underway. I picked up one of the balls and attempted to throw it to one of my dad's friends. It completely missed its target as the gravity on the planet was not that of earth. I believe it was significantly less as one of the balls thrown went much higher than expected.   This dream felt spiritually significant and there was something not just \"alien\" about the planet. The feeling that I've had that heaven is right around the corner is similar to the feeling I had in this dream when I came to the top of an ordinary hill and found myself in another world.",

The part you would walk over is no longer there, only the foundation is there. The grey stone part of the bridge spreads down the banks of the stream on either side of it, as well as going down and up the stream. It’s really, really high. There are stairs carved out of the stone. When you climb up to the top, you can see the air - it’s whipping around. I can feel my hair whipping across my face. The mist from the river is mixed in with this air, so my hair quickly turns into small ropes and is slapping against my skin. My clothes are slapping against my legs. Looking down creates this really strong sense of vertigo. I’ve been told to climb up here, yet the stairs aren’t safe. Once you get up to the top, you walk a little bit and look straight down. There are vertical steps - so not stairs on an incline, but vertical, which is really dangerous, especially in this kind of wind. The water current is one big current and it looks like it’s muddy and murky because it moves so fast all the time, so all of this stuff from the bottom of the river is stirred up, so you can’t see through it at all. There’s other bits of debris, like logs and twigs and other natural items from the earth. I can see a few people way down there. They're just looking at the stairs but not moving. I’m supposed to climb back down these vertical stairs. I’m trying, but at this point, my son comes into my room and shouts at me. That’s enough of a jolt that I’m able to get up and move my body.",

We sit down on the couch in the living room for a few moments. Her young son is there. I’ve never seen him in person before. I’m watching him play. Then, Michelle says to me: would I take a look at her plant window and help her to move all the plants in front of that window and get them hung in that place because they’re dying. So we go down to the bedroom and she shows me the window. The light that is shining through is radiant and it dazzles my eyes. I can’t even look at the window because the light is so bright. So I stand to the side of it and turn my head toward it and look that way. I see that there’s actually a sheer curtain hanging from a rod in front of the window. I didn’t notice it before because the light coming through was so dazzling. There are two plants hanging from the curtain rod. The ceiling is really high. While I’m looking at this and strategizing and thinking, hmm, how are we going to do this, she comes in and has this big vase, about 2 feet long and with mosaic on it. The colors are (...)",

This time I’m afraid she’ll know I’ve been here and there will be hell to pay. Natasha is in the room with a male therapist and my husband. They have all done some very deep emotional work of some kind and are passed out on the bed. I don’t sense anything sexual, though. I rush in to tell them that we must go now! They’re too slow to rise and I keep urging them on, trying to convey the sense of urgency. They slowly start to pack up their bags. At first they just have a couple small bags, but as they pack, it seems more suitcases and piles of clothes accumulate. I’m really getting worried and panicked. The suitcases are overflowing with clothes and not closed. There are drying racks full of clothes. There’s no way we’ll get out this time without her (Ursula) knowing we’ve been here. I’m terrified at the possible repercussions. In another scene, I am in a small conference room of a hotel with sliding glass doors. My son is with me. Other people are there, too. I’m needing to teach a yoga class over Zoom, so I’m pulling up the class on my phone, wearing my headphones, trying to teach to the people on the screen, and chasing after my son. Some people are doing yoga, others are on the beach hanging out, others are in their home or driving their car. It’s quite unmanageable, but somehow I keep teaching. My son escapes and jumps into the pool. He’s having a great time splashing about and the people in the pool are watching us both. There’s something about shoes later on, but I can’t recall. Another scene: I am in a cafeteria and it is crowded. I’m with two men and am attracted to them both, but we cannot hear each other speak. I boldy suggest that we go away from the crowd to a more private table to talk.",

But now I’m watching this man I know, Stan - he was an upperclassman for a few years when I was in school and he had a twin brother. He’s standing in front of a huge loom, the size of a garage door. There’s this other man who is a stranger to the culture, not raised in Hawaii, but he really wants to know how to weave this loom with flowers. It’s kind of like he’s trying to learn the native ways. I’d say these men are both in their late 20s, early 30s. So this man that’s trying to learn, he’s a stranger to me in the dream, he has picked a flower - it’s a gorgeous purple flower with maybe 5 petals that are long and spiky and the stamin in the center are also long and really skinny and you can see the pollen at the tips. He’s trying to weave this entire loom with these purple flowers. He’s doing okay under the instruction of Stan. I’m feeling frustrated watching him because that’s not a flower that Native Hawaiians ever wove with or made lei with. So I’m like this guy doesn’t get it - he doesn’t understand the meaning of each flower that the Hawaiians would use. But he’s gotten most of the door woven. He keeps messing up. I go to try to help him complete it. Parts of what he’s woven falling off the frame. I’m trying to help him keep it taut. I started out observing, but now I’m part of the dream. I’m trying to show him how and the other guy is trying to show him how, too. He doesn’t get it. There’s a part of me that’s like, “This guy is a little bit mental, he’s slow on the uptake, he’s not understanding how to do this.” Then Stan suddenly turns into a black cat and is so affectionate with me. This is funny because cats are not always affectionate. But as a cat, he’s super affectionate with me and I can feel he’s still waiting for this other guy to complete the weaving.

What I see with my eyes is a big bluish grey, but not a chart...it’s like I’m inside the chart. I realize I'm looking at patterns of people at an anthropological level from around the world and the choices that they make in food. I’m watching them like small dots. I’m wondering what this is. I look at them and study them for long enough. They’re moving. I see almost like an arc, a pendulum, that swings from the cluster of dots of choices they make, and I’m not even sure that they’re all food related - I don’t think they are. They’re clustering. Then one of the dots will swing out like a pendulum, then pause. It’s moved into this other category of things that they’ve learned. The learning is an evolutionary succession. In the dream, I seem to understand the macro-level implications of this without needing to know the exact words or categories of each choice. My thinking brain is in wonderment at realizing what all these small clusters of activity arrive at - like an aha! Then I move from realizing that some of them are food choices. The dreams shifts from a macro-level to what is happening right now on the earth. Then I arrive in a restaurant. I’m looking at people’s food choices. It starts at a table with a woman I haven’t seen in a long time - Margie is one of my daughter’s friend’s mothers. I haven’t seen her since my daughter was in Grade 8 because the kids ended up going to different high schools. Margie sits down and makes some kind of comment like, “I thought we were friends, but you never contacted.” I express surprise at this and say, “Yes, I live over here now and work every evening as well as in the day. I don’t have time for that kind of thing.” She seems to feel amenable to that explanation and starts talking to me about her family. As she’s talking, this other young lad, maybe 17 (...)",

There’s a place on the farside of the pool where a man makes scones and homemade soaps and also sells produce. I get a job at the Rec Facility cleaning up. I’m at the side of the pool, pulling in the lane ropes out of the water and to the side of the pool. There are still people in the water. A man comes and is completely bald. He has a lot of vitality about him and is charming and warm. I can tell by the way he carries himself that he is a man of great wealth. He asks if he can help me and I tell him I don’t need help. I continue on with my work. He stays nearby, but is not lurking, just looking around. Then I go through the glass doors. There are bikes on display that are for sale. People have gathered to see a demonstration of a new bike. A man comes up from the crowd to help pull ropes and gears from under the ground to the stage to help demonstrate what this new bike can do. We’re all watching and waiting. This bike is expensive and the technology is quite advanced. The charming and beautiful bald man is standing next to me and after watching for a bit, he decides to buy a bike without knowing or asking the cost. I observe that he must be quite wealthy. Then, I am standing in line for my daily scone. He is with me and stands in line behind me. He is asking me about the scones, soap and produce. I tell him about how wonderful it all is. People pre-order scones, so they are guaranteed a scone each day, but there is a small selection of scones available. He steps up to the counter and orders 5 scones for both of us to share. The flavors are sophisticated, two pink ones with cardamom and peppercorn, two chocolate, and a plain one. The pink and chocolate scones are on a higher plate, and the icing drizzles down to the plain one. They look delicious.

As Aila, she is very reverent and has a lot of knowledge. She is bringing a lot of spiritual knowledge and reverence to my dream. As my kumu hula, I feel uneasy around her because she was very emotionally abusive towards me and oppressive of who I was. So I’m going back and forth through a lot of feelings in this dream. Aila is trying to organize a ritual and gathering. She’s trying to gather the people to do ritual. She’s also trying to gather the people in protest. The gathering is happening on a train. We are all getting on this train. The train has a destination, but I’m not sure where. There are men and women. We are gathering in a town and we’re trying to gather because the powers that be - those in charge of the town - are actively trying to suppress us, suppress our rights. I just have the sense of them being the bad guy - and it’s men. We’re all on this train and there are police officers who are trying to interfere and interrupt. Aila’s kids are with her. Mine are not, but I know where they are. Along with the other townspeople, there are also a bunch of younger men who are teenagers or early twenties. We’re on the train and gathering for the ritual, but it’s taking a really long time to start. As I watch, the younger men get off the train. They are not there to support. Their excuse is that they have to go to their practices for their organized sports, whatever that is. I’m watching and I see Aila’s partner Austin who is this very tall cowboy with the boots, the hat, the buckle. He gets off the train to go rather these younger men who are basically deserting. They are deserting their wives, girlfriends, mothers and even fathers - the older grey beards - who are on the train. Aila is still preparing for ritual for all of us to take part in.

My consciousness has filtered down and is inhabiting a man who is involved in explosives. So my consciousness is inside this man who is in a store. It appears to be a bookstore that sells other sundry items. But his contact is the employee who works in the store. So he’s not there to buy books. I realize I’m not in my own body because I see my arm and it’s a man arm with a man hand. I look at my chest and am wearing a leather jacket that’s not mine.

There’s a young girl that we are responsible for, or taking care of. I don’t know if she’s a daughter or younger sister, but she’s important and it’s imperative that we keep her safe. There’s a gathering of people. We’re trying to find her a coat to keep her warm. We set her up so she’s in one spot and she gets her coat. She’s trying on coats. We are outdoors and it’s cold. We snag a coat from a rack of coats. There’s something so special about this girl. She has a light shining from the inside. Everything around us is twilight and dull looking and dirty, but she’s not that. She’s a brighter light. So we get her this coat and make sure she’s warm. One of the men feels like she’s adequately protected in this little area that she’s in. So he leaves her for a second so she can get a sense of autonomy. He and the other man - I think they are brothers - are closeby. But they don’t exactly have their eyes on her because she disappears and they start to panic.

I would take my car and drive it down this really long stretch of road and catch enough air to hop the channel - a very wide expanse of ocean between the islands. Somehow I’m trying to convince him I can do this. He’s very harsh. I’m trying to live up to expectations. It’s very strange because that is definitely not how I roll in real life. I’m driving the car to the place where I know we can catch enough air to ocean hop. We get to the end of the road - to this spot where I know I’ve done it before. There’s a huge wall rising up out of the ocean. It’s painted in colors of blue to look like the ocean. There’s actually ocean that comes over the top of it - water has been pumped over the top to make waterfalls. I’m shocked because it was definitely not there before. The times I had tried it, the road went off the edge of a cliff so you could catch some air. Now the road goes down and hits a shore. There's no way to catch enough air to get off of that and over this huge wall that’s now in front of us. I can feel that he is questioning me and what I’m telling him. He’s suspicious. I take the car and I get down to the bottom and see this is not happening. So I turn the car around. We head off to the right to an old dive bar. I say, “Maybe there’s somebody over there who can help us who’s done it before.” So we park and we go in. It’s totally dimly lit and smoky. The food is greasy and gross. We sit there and the woman who comes up to take our ord (...)",

    "text": "“The Greenhouse” This dream begins in the house I grew up in for a little while. I’m standing in the driveway and I see my ex-husband drive up. He’s in a van and he comes out of the van. He’s loading things from the back of the van onto the driveway. I see his dead son, whom I never met in real life, get out of the van with him and sit on the driveway. Then my ex is busy with something at the other end of the driveway. Now there’s a hill where the back up the van is, going up to where my ex is busy. His dead son is trying to climb up the hill to get to him, but he can’t because he can’t walk. He was crippled in real life. So I go over to help him. I put my arm around his waist and my other hand is digging at the earth and I’m draggin him up with me so he can get there. Now it’s muddy and I keep sliding back down. We finally make it to the top and we’re both covered with mud. I see the son is beside his dad. I turn around and go inside the house to clean myself up. As I’m doing this, I notice that mud has been tracked into the house - into the kitchen and dining room. I want to clean it up and wonder how it got in here. I realize that his dead son has been walking through the house. I have something in my hand - I think it’s a cloth to wipe up the mud with. I notice that already there’s potato bugs and worms crawling around. The worms are like maggots. They’re stretching themselves across the floor, then shrinking up into smaller things. They’re migrating rather quickly. Then the cat comes in and starts walking though it. I’m like, “No! Stop, stop!” The cat goes backwards, but doesn’t see where it’s going and it falls all the way down the stairs. I’m like oh no! I run down the stairs and pick up the cat. It’s fine, but I feel horrible for yelling at it. I’m cradling it in my arms and see that it’s got two blue pieces of paper in its eyes keeping its eyelids open. One of the papers is frayed enough that I can just grab it in between my fingernails and pull it out. The (...)",

I have a memory of walking and talking with him and seeing a wedding ring. Now, his left ring finger is bare and his right ring finger has a silver band. Then I excuse myself to go to the bathroom. I walk in and am so disgusted. There is diarrhea all over the floor and big sticky gobs of shit everywhere - toilet seat and floor - and an especially disgusting yellow mucousy looking one dripping off the handicap bar. There is toilet paper strewn all over, too. I still have to pee. I end up getting shit on my hand. Then I’m trapped in this repeated portion of the dream, where I am trying to pull my pants up. I have one of my son’s diapers on and as I’m pulling the pants and diaper up, I keep smearing poop on the outside of the diaper’s right panel. It’s gross. I’m trying to repeat the scene in the dream to make the poop disappear, rather than deal with cleaning it up. I am in this bathroom with all this shit for a really long time. The dream shifts. I’m at a restaurant, sitting at a table all by myself. I’m looking out across the other tables and I see an acquaintance, Liz, and her husband. She is wearing a revealing black and red snake skin dress that displays her body and all her tattoos. She’s also wearing high red shoes. She’s flaunting her body. She’s looking back and forth at me and my husband. I see that my husband is sitting at a table near her. My husband is sitting with another person - this person is both the man I was enjoying tea with and a woman, somehow. Liz has a haughty look about her, assuming things aren’t going well with my husband because I’m sitting alone and my husband is enjoying the company of another person for dinner. Liz gets up and walks around to my husband’s table to say hello. All the while, her chin is lifted and she’s looking back and forth between my husband and me in this “knowing (...)",

My wife in the dream was not extraordinarily beautiful but she was attractive with long blonde, curly hair. I do not remember anything else about her features except that she was reasonably thin, though not skinny. It didn't feel as if we were a good match for one another. Our relationship was strained and we weren't \"in love\".   I didn't know what to do, yet I wanted our relationship to work. I hoped that we could learn to have feelings for one another since we were married and stuck together. I decided that we would have to have a serious talk and figure out what we could be doing better. I realized that there was a specific area in which I wasn't doing a good job. In the dream, I spoke clearly to her and formulated a plan for our next attempt at fulfilling sex. I want to say that the problem was that I wasn't as kind and affirmative as we were making love, but as I do not remember the words I spoke, I can't be sure.   We agreed to try again, and started making out. It went better this time, though there was still one complication that had to be overcome.",

As we climbed a hill, we saw a church building. It was old and dilapidated, and we entered hoping that they would not follow or would fail to find us. It was dark and musty inside with few hiding places large enough for me. I may have been a child, but I was larger than the others who had found nooks and crannies in which to stow themselves. I spotted a square hole in the back wall of the church, but it was just too small for me to squeeze through. I may have ducked behind a wooden railing at the front of the church, but it was no use. They had found us. We managed to slip past them out of a back door and run down a steep grassy hill behind the church. I could see my black horse a hundred yards away. We ran past and as we descended, it was only me and a girl. She was 10 years old or so, and I think I was not much older. I think that I was a boy, but I am not sure. We came to the edge of a steep hill, so steep that it was almost a cliff. Looking down was a small coastal town and directly before us, a dirt path in the grass descended sharply to the water. It had two wheel tracks as if it were made for vehicles. The girl hopped on her bicycle and took off down the hill. I was scared she would crash and hesitated before following on foot. As I watched her descend, I saw that she was heading toward a ramp which was attached to a small shed such that the ramp was flush with wall of the shed and came up to the roof. The problem was that the roof had an overhang such that I was sure that the girl would hit it and crash. I tried to warn her but she neither heeded me nor crashed. She made the jump and landed in the water. I was so convinced  that she couldn't have made the jump that I took her bike and tried it myself. I may have even called her back up from the water in order to prove my point. I remember explaining to her peda (...)",

The town is actually really pretty, like a turn of the century town, probably built around the railroad. There are still remnants of that in the architecture, cobblestone, and gaslights on the street that have been converted to electricity. I meet the staff of the Yoga Studio at the coffee shop across the street. We chat about some upcoming themes. I cross the street with them. I’ve parked my car behind that building. They unlock the Yoga Studio and we go in to teach. We set up and I teach a yoga class. I come out and a man is sitting there. I don’t recall him being inthe class. We have a little conversation. I know him from university. One of the other staff comes out and suggests to the owner in front of me that my class was insensitive to someone’s trauma. The owner lets out a guffaw, because if anything, I’m known for my sensitivity to that kind of thing. She says, “What do you mean? Can you describe it?” The other staff member lifts her arms up towards the sky, bends her knees a little bit and says that someone’s thigh may have touched their belly in that pose. Again, the owner says, “Well if someone is that sensitive to themselves, then they shouldn’t be coming to class.” Meanwhile, I haven’t said anything, but I’m surprised that things have gotten this far where sensitivities are so cloistered that they can’t even be in a yoga class and we keep changing the world to adjust to that level of sensitivity. I’m kind of mulling that around in my mind thinking, “Is there any way to make the class more trauma-aware to body touching? Or has this gone too far?” So I’m thinking about this as everybody gathers up their things and leaves the building. By now, it’s nighttime. The owners lock the door and get in their car. Then I realize I don’t have my keys. I cross the street quickly and am yelling their names. I realize  (...)",

Between us and the church was a house with a chimney. I saw smoke rising from where the chimney was, but something made me think that the smoke was not coming from the chimney but from a fire in the church behind it.   A voice in my head told me that the chimney was there and that the smoke had to be coming from it, as if to quiet any suspicions that the church was on fire. I turned away to my dad and brother who were in front of me and to my left. They were climbing over things on the roof. When I turned back to the church, I saw that it was going up in flames. It had caught fire quickly.  Within a few seconds, the roof of the church was engulfed in flames and burning debris had already flown toward our building the edges of which had already begun to burn. We quickly scrambled to make our way down and with some difficulty managed to do so.",

But something happens that opens up an entire set of bleachers and suddenly more people are able to be there. I’m watching from the other side of the stadium. In my mind’s eye I’m seeing this area full of people watching a concert. It’s my birthday or something because I’m being celebrated or maybe it’s a wedding. In the next scene, I’m in a building in a hall - like you would rent to throw a birthday party or luau. There’s an alcove off to the side and a kitchen where you would put dishes. I’m still being celebrated somehow. The party in this hall is in my honor.

She’s a really sweet, innocent child. She is innocent to the extent that she will trust anyone. We go to a number of places on a roadtrip - it lasts a week. I feel like we might be somewhere on the Eastern seaboard of the states by the temperate climate and the vegetation and trees, as well as the hills. It is quite beautiful. We visit some scenic places as well as some historical places. My friend’s daughter is a pleasure to be with and explore with. My family begins to find an affection for her. At some time, both of my ears become sore and infected. I can’t hear anyone. I’m sleepy and I’m not feeling well. For the past two days of the vacation, I can’t wake up and I stay in the travel van. At one point I wake up and my stepmother has put cotton in my ears and I wasn’t even aware of it. Then when we get back to where we’re staying I still sleep. They ask if I’m okay. I say, “Yes, I think I just need to sleep.” The vacation is over and now I return my friend’s daughter to him. When we get back to his place, he’s cleaned his apartment from top to bottom. He’s planted some beautiful plants in his bathroom - some look like cattails and bulrushes that are growing up from something in the floor around the toilet. The bicycles are all moved from the kitchen. I note that one of the bicycles is worth thousands of dollars. It’s got something for someone to sit on on the back of it, but the construction and design of it is so heavy that it takes two people to pedal it. So there is that provision. Where the bicycle chain and gears would be, there is a case overtop of it - to protect the inside of the legs of whoever is pedaling it. Then there’s another one of a different design, less expensive, more sporty for his son. So he says, “Would you mind waiting here just a little bit longer while I take these down to my gar (...)",

Yet the birds don’t try to leave. The song is not the song they would normally make and this puzzles me. There’s a mixture of birds - pigeons, song birds, sparrows. None of them are making their song. It’s this rapid alarm noise and they’re all making it despite different species, which also puzzles me. I wonder if they’re afraid of the dog. But I’ve been in this apartment before visiting, and I know that the birds and the dog will sit together on the floor, so I don’t think that’s the reason. So I feed the dog.

And I wonder why they don’t fly out of the cage because they sound afraid to me. As I get closer to the cage, their noise stops. As I back away , it gets louder. I wonder if I should stay to comfort them. Then the dream just ends.",

The meeting starts and they’re talking about things. As I’m recording this, I’m noticing that no one is really sharing the conversation. No decision is being made. They’re just talking about everything. They move from one thing to another and it’s taking an extraordinary long period of time and it’s unproductive. I start doodling on my page and not really recording anything. Then they get to a conversation where someone has brought up that they smell marijuana in the complex. I think to myself, “Well, of course you do. It’s legal in Canada now.”They’re talking about the smell. They don’t like walking through smells.

I’ve smelled it for another half a second when I’m walking on a sidewalk to the grocery store.” So the clouds of smoke from somebody’s house half a mile away have drifted around like other smells do from the kitchen and people’s bathrooms.

We go down to the shore of the lake and there’s a prearranged yellow inflatable raft - like an expensive Zodiac dinghy. There are three or four others with us. We get into the dinghy and we’re dressed for whaling. We are wearing rain gear and waterproof boots that are zipped into the rain gear.

Traveling through Asia as a college kid, following in with an anarchist gang and getting into a lot of trouble. Fleeing a penitentiary sentence I escaped to an island and found my true love. He didn’t believe in marriage or monogamy and I found space to allow his love in my life and not have it be the center of my life. I accepted his conditions. I raised our child kind of solo with him in and out for long periods of time. He ran a hostel on the beach which is where I met him. There was never a sentiment of hate or resentment. At some point I decided to leave the island with my kid and travel back to the states and settled down there for a while. When the child grew up I returned to my nomadic Ways and wandered back to the island. There were no phones or anything like that but I found my love at the hostel and we settled in together there until he died. This dream spanned from age 18 to 70. I was grateful for what I had. I didn’t control or expect anything, which is weird, because it is not how I am in waking life. I woke up missing him. I accepted a lot of limitations, particularly with my lover, and surrendered to it - having a beautiful life with and without him. I chose love over what I thought was due to me.",

    "text": "I was working in a house for someone. It wasn’t dark outside but it wasn’t light either- a place I’ve never been in real life but in my dream I’ve been there before. It was old fashioned; it looked Victorian style - lots of lace and a huge heavy dining room table with claw feet. I was hurrying to clean up before the owners came home. There were at least two dogs with me, one small/medium sized and golden brownish and one larger and brown. I think they belonged to the owners of the house but I took care of them. I think a big wave came at the end of the dream with water rushing everywhere and then I woke up (or thought I did) and I thought my Apple Watch was calling someone but when I checked later it wasn’t. It seemed like it really happened. I thought I heard, “hello, hello” in a deep female or lighter male voice. I double checked my iPhone and my Apple Watch which I was wearing to monitor my heart rate. I wasn’t scared but confused.",

I opened the door and it was packed, like a sardine can. There was only one space so I slipped into it and was just standing there. It’s a line for something. I don’t know what it’s for. It’s the only place I can stand, so I just stand there. As the line is moving, I’m moving with it. I’ve essentially cut in the line, but it doesn’t make sense. But then a person starts saying, “You cut! You cut!” They were being really mean. I was like, “I didn’t do it on purpose. I just came in and there was only one space and I just stood here.” Then they proceeded to go and tell other people that I cut and I’m not a good person. I was getting so upset because I didn’t do it on purpose, I came in and it was the only space to go to. Then at a certain point, some guy came in. He was telling a story and he had the loudest booming voice, as if he had a microphone, but it was his normal voice. I think he was a famous actor. Everybody was enamored with him, but I wanted to be as far away as possible because his voice was so loud and it was hurting my ears. Then someone said to me, “You know, you should probably leave. These really aren’t your people. These people aren’t good for you or on your frequency.”",

I look down and see two snakes. At first I assume they are just plastic. They are both black, yellow and red. One is primarily yellow, the other is primarily red. Then I look more carefully and see they are alive. I stop for a moment and think this is impossible. But they are both stretching out towards my mom and one has its tongue out as if tasting the air around her leg. Then I realize they are alive and I urge my mom to stand back because these snakes are alive. She quickly moves back. Then, we realize it’s a test of some kind. One snake is poisonous and the other is not. Which one is poisonous? We are trying to remember by their markings. In another scene, I’m with Pema upstairs in my home (it shares some similarities with my current apartment, but not entirely). The banisters are overgrown with lavender, but it's growing as a vine. We are talking about family dynamics, particularly our parents’ dynamics. She tells me that her mom told her that her dad would never leave because it’s too complicated. Somehow, her saying this reassures me. Then someone comes and ties back the lavender with bungee cords to tame it and help guide its growth, so it doesn’t overcrowd the hallway. It looks more beautiful now. I’m upstairs for a while, then I notice new decorations on the wall - carved wood. I go downstairs and see it was some kind of Christmas day. My dad and my sister are sitting on the couch, and there’s a man with bright red hair sitting on the floor. They’re watching a movie on the projector screen. They have just opened presents. The guy asks my sister about the origin story of her daughter’s name. She starts to cry because it is such a poignant story. She says, “I wonder if I can just write it on paper? Then I wouldn’t cry so much.” The guy steps away to give her space. She starts to cry tho (...)",

    "text": "“The Swan Costume” In this dream, I’m in Spain, I think. It’s a warm balmy country and although I don't see the ocean, I feel it in the air. The place I’m in is a palazzo. Everything is made of stucco -hardened and painted these warm brilliant colors like deep red and deep orange. The floor is also made of the same thing, but it’s painted a deep grey. IIn this dream I am Spanish. My skin is darker, my hair is a dark brown. I work as part of a family and with my family in this palazzo. My father is a police officer. He’s investigating some kind of credit card crime. He has stolen credit cards tucked into a book that’s like a photo album that closes with a zipper and is leather. Sometimes he asks me to get it and move it from its secure location up to where he is because he is missing some aspects of this case. The other thing I do is I get him some other materials. It’s like he’s training me to be an investigator. So I do this running around the palazzo in different rooms on different floors for him. Then at one point, in the dream, it deviates. I’m in a different country. I'm a different person. I’m in a kitchen scene where I’m trying to get my sibling to help me with the dishes. There are two sinks - one on an island and one on a counter. There are piles and piles of dishes. My sibling keeps only washing one dish then sitting down on the floor. I keep washing 50 then turning around and there’s only 1. My sibling is supposed to be doing this at the island and I’m supposed to be doing this at the other sink. Then I’m putting them away in a pantry in a slightly different room around the corner. At one of these times in the pantry, I have a plant. It just suddenly appears in my hand. I’m trying to figure out where it goes in the pantry. I open up a cupboard and it has all these wooden slats that would be part of blinds - like the California shutters you close over your windows. It’s a historical chronology of the evolution of a slat of a blind. I think, “Oh, that’s kin (...)",

It is mostly men with just a few women. Then we all fall to the ground. We’re waiting for the next instructions. I’m next to my friend George - he’s gay and black. I look around through slitted eyes because we’re supposed to have our eyes closed. The choreographer instructs us that in the next few moments we are going to sit up and kiss people. This is a necessary part if we are going to remain in the cast. I’m not pleased about this. George whispers to me that now is my opportunity to get out. Somehow he slips away. The rest of us sit up and before I know what's happening an Asian man has pulled me into an embrace. His eyes don’t converge and it’s unsettling. One eye looks up and the other eye looks past me. He pulls me and I can feel him grab my lip with his teeth. I don't like it, but it’s not too awful. He continues to kiss and I try to kiss back because it’s what I’m expected to do. Then I feel his hand reach up to touch my nipple and I’m horrified by it. It feels awful. I hate it because I’m still so sensitive from nursing. So I push him away and think, “Fuck this, I’m not staying for this no matter what.” I quickly walk away and am in a library. It’s dark, no lights on. I’m wandering around as if it were a maze, and I’m trying to get lost so they can’t find me. In one aisle, I hear them talking about how I just got up and left without explanation and I need to come back. I’m wearing my fitted dance clothes. I notice in my hand a big wad of paper towels. I’m trying to figure out what to do with it because I don’t want to hold it or be found with it. I don’t have a pocket. I also don’t want to leave it on a bookshelf and there are no rubbish containers. I try to tuck it into my hair to hide it.",

It’s quite cuddly, cute and soft, like a baby. I arrive at her other house and see a lot of people. They are soaking in hot tubs by the lake. There isn’t a spot for me here.

It’s pouring rain - the kind where the roads are flooding. To get into the street that turns onto my cul-de-sac, we go over a stream. The stream is directly under the road but has come up over the road. I have to park the car. The siblings in the car are with me, but we’re not interacting - they’re kind of shadowed in the background. I have to get across the water to get into the cul-de-sac, so the car is parked. There are all these road workers here to help us. I get out and they’re very specific in showing me how to cross it. They’re going to help me get over it. They say, “This part right here is deeper because the water has worn so much of the road away. But we’ve put some rocks down right here for you to walk across.” I get the sense that there’s also a small child with me because I’m being extra careful because I have to help them get across, too. I think it’s actually my son. The workers help us across this water and it is pretty deep, but because the rocks are there, it only goes up to our knees. Then we cross over and get onto the road. It stops raining and there’s no more water, but it is wet. We walk past a neighbor’s house. They have strawberry guava growing in their yard and it’s ripe. So I stop and I pick a bunch to eat and a bunch to take with me to save for later or turn into jam or jelly. I show my son and he’s eating some of them. We continue down the road.

When they recognized her, they knew they could switch and get to know the other community. She said yes, knowing they needed a break - knowing more in an omniscient way. It starts with me in a women’s camp environment - it was a futuristic settlement. Everyone wore farmhouse settler dresses and also face masks. This is a landscape I’ve been dreaming of all month but haven’t remembered any details until this episode. I discovered my twin doppelgänger and they had dominion over a galactic camp nearby. They looked like me - their appearance was female but they wore a burdensome huge mask covering head, face and shoulders with interlocking hydraulics spiked around the base. They’re in prairie dresses, but wearing steampunk style masks. You can’t tell who they are because they’re dressed the same and covering their faces. People aren’t addressing each other by name and interacting all day, but not in a personal way. They discovered me from a televised program I was on about agricultural excursions into the reaches of the community borders and asked to do an identity swap. I agreed but was scared. There was a salon area of town with “bars” like downtown but they were only big enough for 2 people each - like a redlight district. These are social distancing bars with screens at each bar, so you can join other people in conversation. It’s psychedelic with bright lights, but it’s dumpy, everything is falling apart. It reminds me of Blade Runner. Mischievous activity is afoot. There were men there. I was doing some restoration work on a building and my two nieces were underfoot chasing each other while I worked.

As is typical, if possible, people are supposed to get down to the boat early, unpack, get everything ready, then cast off. So I’ve got a small pack with my clothes and necessities in it. I go to where I’m sleeping on the boat and arrange everything. I unpack and secure it so nothing is going to fly around. Then we’re waiting because the wind has died down. We’re waiting for the wind to pick up. There’s a dinghy. Normally dinghies are just the bottom part of a boat. This one has an inflatable mast and sail on it. It’s really silly. I’m on this dinghy and it’s tied off to the middle of the ship. At first I’m just standing on the inflatable outside part. I’m hanging on to the mast and sail. It’s going from one side of the boat, around the bow, down the other side of the boat, to the stern, and it goes back up, around, and down. I’m just lazily going around and around like this. Then I think, “Hmm, I could actually fall asleep here.” I’m in danger of doing so. I think, “Well, I better not fall asleep.” So I lean back for a little and create a little resistance on the rope. Again it wanders from port to bow to starboard to stern and back. I do this for a little while. I think, “Well, I really don't even need this inflatable sailboat.” I twine the rope around the soles of my feet and I climb up it a little bit. Now, because of my body weight, I’m going around from port, bow, starboard, stern quite a bit faster. I’m starting to swing around it. The inflatable dinghy has now just disappeared - it’s not in the dreamscape anymore. I’m swinging around on this rope. I’m really enjoying this swinging part. So I move with the momentum, the way you would do with your body if you were on a swing. I’m moving with my core in order to get it to move faster, and I’m flying quite quickly through the air now. I start to laugh because it feels really good  (...)",

She asks me if I can move it. I apologize and say, “Yeah, I’m trying to go through all this.” Then I ask her what stuff she’s talking about. I look at it and the stuff she’s talking about is gold whiskey decanters. They’re all different kinds and shapes and they’re valuable and they’re all empty. People have given them to us. I never filled them because I don’t drink whiskey. I didn't throw them away because they were gifts. Some of them I haven’t even looked in. So she’s indicating them. I pick them up. These ones are squares - six squares made of gold with rings on the top that you pull on and the decanter slides up out of the square gold carrying case. That’s when I notice they’re empty. Then I realize that he’s taken some of them, but only the ones that had whiskey in them. So I think, ”What am I going to do with all these?” Then I open the door and in the hallway, some sales rep from a whiskey company has set up a display of different kinds of whiskey. I think, “Hmmm, I wonder if I can just set all the decanters up there when they’re not looking and they'll just think it’s part of the display.” So, now I’m busy with that. I’m opening the door, peeking out into the hallway, and waiting for all the people to leave so I can do this.",

It was a small flip-phone and I was having difficulty pulling it up as I was mistyping or forgetting the name of the song. Eventually I handed the phone back to Evan and he tried to find it, but he couldn't either. Or more accurately he gave up in frustration. That emotion was clear. We gave up and decided that instead of bothering with this we'd go to the beach instead and go for a nice walk.   We got into his car where we joined up with my brother and drove to the beach. It was a bright and sunny day and the perfect temperature for a walk outside. We pulled up to the gate and office where we had to pay for our entrance pass for the state park where the beach was located. The woman in the security building looked into the car and told us that because of recent events (covid19 presumably) that only 2 people at a time could go walking on the  beach. I think it was then that I suggested that they could go without me and I'd visit the various shops on the little strip which we had driven past. But they would have none of that and insisted that we stick together.  We drove away and found a bar. We entered and within we saw two very large biker-looking dudes. They were heavy set with long golden curly hair which fell past their shoulders. They both had beers in their hands and were clearly drunk. One of them spoke to the other mentioning the percentage of water in his cup and how that was tied to him being or not being drunk or dehydrated. The whole question as to whether or not beer is hydrating or dehydrating. :) We went to the upper level of the bar where there was a balcony which overlooked the parking lot outside. It was then that we noticed there were cops positioned around the building.

There are cows, sheep, pigs and goats on conveyor belts, packed closely together and lined up for their death, but they aren’t being killed for food or any other useful purpose. They are lined up from smallest to largest. We are on a private tour and I’m watching these animals going past me on the belt. There are horses, cows, then elephants. I’m shocked at seeing a big pink pig with tusks next to an elephant - the same size as the elephant. It’s depressing to see all of this. I continue walking up a ramp. I go into an upper room and see lambs and baby unicorns. They have IV tubes wrapped around their legs - they are either being poisoned or resuscitated, I cannot tell. They do look sickly.

He told us that the police were after him, falsely thinking that he had committed some crime. To escape, he had dug a hole in the ground roughly 4 by 4 feet in which he had created 4 large tunnels. He had gone through one of them and figured that this would throw the police off since they'd have to split up. Now he was back at the house and was preparing to leave again.

We were at the top of the resort walking through some terraced ponds where ducks (or some waterbird) were swimming). The ponds were surrounded by concrete and were smaller than swimming pools. They were shallow and we either walked directly through them or on concrete paths. There was some interaction between myself and whoever was with me (mother or brother) and I ended up jumping or falling down to the lower terrace. It was 6-10 feet down and I was worried about it not being deep enough. I looked down at some white birds which I think were on an even further terrace which was longer and skinnier and more rectangular.   Across from the terraces was a long walkway directly to the edge of a large lake. We walked down it maybe half of a mile till we got to a cluster of cabins to our right. This is where we were staying. We dropped everything off and began unpacking We left later and went out to explore the resort. Later we went back to go to bed and while looking for everything that we needed, and not being able to, I realized that I was in the wrong cabin and had unpacked my belongings in the other one.   The next day we got up and walked back along the pathway to a large white building on our left which was a petting zoo of sorts. I went up to the door and tried to figure out to open. It was also white but had a mesh of wires and a circular window. I couldn't figure out any opening mechanism but eventually someone showed me that it was opened like a castle gate, straight up by pulling up via the metal meshwork.   We got inside and walked further into the building which looked like a large warehouse with tall white and concrete floors. I saw that there was a small building in front of us which contained a men's and women's restroom. My mom said that she needed to use one and I did as well. I asked her if we should stop now, but she said that she could wait.",

    "text": "“Spirit People” I’m teaching my group of yoga teacher trainees. One of them has arranged for a field trip. The field trip is three yoga classes in a row and they’re all different. She gives me the address and we gather our group together. We’re on foot. The address is an arena - like a recreation center. I wonder about this for a moment because it seems temporary instead of a quality class asI had outlined to her. I wanted qualified teachers with experience. But I don’t say anything. I’m just trusting her. We enter the doors, go up the hallway and it’s on the top floor. She says, “This is where we’re supposed to go - my contact is up here.” We enter in the doors at the top floor. The contact is an MC and we’re at a wedding. He asks us for some kind of identification and why we’re here. At this point, I look at my student who arranged this field trip. I’m waiting for her to speak up. So she does, and she says she was the one talking to him earlier and arranged for us to attend the three yoga classes. He says, “Wait here. I’ll be back in a moment.” So he leaves us in the room. Then he returns and says, “I don’t know who you were talking to, but no one is expecting you. You are welcome to join in the first yoga class, however.” The first yoga class is all the bride’s family. They’re all dressed in wedding attire. The instructor is taking us through a few postures - the way sometimes a vacation instructor that’s never been trained guides a group of tourists to what they think a class might be. At this point, I’m figuring there’s probably not even two more and this is a waste of time. Then, all of a sudden, the waiters are coming out and they’re serving food. They’re putting it all out on this long table. We - my class - know we aren’t included in the wedding, but they sit down at a table near the back. I’m suggesting we leave. But they’re just sitting there, unresponsive. At this point, I overhear someone from my group - they’re standing behind me - commenting on the br (...)",

I go out into the garden and I walk all the way out to the far end where there is a fence. I see five wooden poles lined up along the fence and pressed into the soil, standing up. I wonder if I’m supposed to cut these down with the garden shears or just note that they’re here. I decide not to cut them because better not to cut then ask for clarification, versus cut them and later discover they were just meant to be found. So, I return. Edward is coming out of the research cottage and my friend Lena is following behind. They’re on a quest and looking for plants, bugs and grubs. I go along on the quest. We’re all looking into the dirt. It’s a fascinating garden walk in the night. He finds a big snail with a grey-silver spiral shell. He taps lightly on the shell with a stick to show us. Then there’s something about talking cats. In another scene, I’m possibly in danger. It’s night. I’m running, running, running. I’m dancing as part of a dance company. We’re rehearsing.

Then I’m with my parents. I’m outside on a street. There’s a curb and a bunch of stand up paddle boards stacked. There’s a bunch of water coming down the street. It’s flooding again. These stand up paddle boards are stacked outside of a store and they’re starting to float off. These boards are a product that once you use them for their initial use, they turn into something else, then turn into something else again. I think it’s quite clever that the people who own this store have managed to figure out how to make items with multiple purposes. So the stand up board changes into a tank for a toilet, which is super efficient and only needs very little water and one flush, then also turns into an indoor house plant or a decoration. I am getting the sense that the products this store is putting out are amazing because each product is 3 different products within one. I’m standing in this street that’s flooded, trying to restack the boards, because I think it’s important for people to get on board with a shop and people who can figure out how to be so efficient and not waste materials and provide the basics of what we need because a stand up paddle board seems like a good idea when the streets are flooding. Then, the dream shifts. There’s a lawn. I’m standing on the side. There are a bunch of people mingling on the lawn - mostly white people. But there’s a Japanese family - mother, father, son. They’re a little bit away from the rest of the crowd and it looks and feels like it's a bit awkward and they aren’t being welcomed into the crowd. But they’re making do because they’re talking with each other Isee the father pick up a pinecone to toss at the son, for him to hit with a bat or catch, like baseball. The dad is in a suit.

In the dream, I was part of some type of ritual circle that I went to once a year and I had to pay to go but it was also a community of women. It was a movement and yoga and something maybe witchy? There is a supernatural element to it, not something I really explored in real life yet, but friends who are into that always joke with me in real life that I am naturally inclined that way... in any case we had an emotional session and I felt like I didn’t belong, like I had grown out of this group and I had decided I would not return the next year... We all came together at the end and were instructed to move our bodies in any way that’s all good. We all got up and started moving around and then we all sunk into a very dynamic and fluid version of extended side angle or a lunge type pose with our extended foot flexed towards the sky and moving our top arm up and over our ears or hands like dancers. We were all looking at each other and then switched in sync. We were moving in unison. It was like the room became warmer and there was a deep color of purple almost on the floor. We were instructed if we wanted to lift our leg and fly into half moon or warrior three pulling our shoulders down and back, and I did standing on my right leg. There was a woman asking for help and we all told her she could do it. Something about my shoulders down and back felt so freeing and warm, so good. The floor was wooden. Of note the whole dream was soft darkness with pastel colors blues purples greens yellows",

I want to check and make sure that they both leave and are on their way home to where they will be taken care of. So as we drive by, first I see my son. I wave to him. He waves back and walks in the direction of home. I know he’ll be fine. Then I see a whole lot of other kids - you know how kids at dismissal time come out in a pack, there may be a few stragglers at first and a few stragglers after the bulk of kids leaving. So we drive slowly. The bulk of kids is gone. I say, “Hang on, I haven’t seen my daughter yet.” A few more kids come out of the school, then I see her. I wave and she waves me over. So I get out of the car and walk over right to her. She says, “Mom, I have something you’ll need.” She hands me this really long sanitary napkin that has a tail at each end. She says, “You’re going to need this.” Then I realize I do need it. But I don't know how to attach it to my body. I go into the school bathroom and I put it inside my underwear. But these tails are so long and I’m trying to fold them in so they don’t stick out. I’m worried it’s going to travel. It feels uncomfortable and bulky between my legs, and I don’t like it. However, it needs to collect blood and I feel myself bleeding. I walk back out thes school, give her a hug and she goes in the same direction as my son. I get into the car. Now I’m uncomfortable and some of the excitement of the road trip has been replaced by the anxiety of this uncomfortable, bulky and insecure thing between my legs. However, I continue on down through the road. The scenery is flat. You can see a lot - miles and miles of flat. There’s a little bit of steppe at the horizon. We drive for a long period of time until we run out of gas. We pull into a gas station. While my friends are tending to the car, I go into the washroom. I check to make  (...)",

After the service James came over to meet William, and he asked which of the two was which. William pretended to be Conrad so that James introduced himself to Conrad instead. I took my Bible which I was holding and whacked William on the top of the head with it in a playful way. I was a little worried that I had hit him too hard, but he was laughing.  I then turned around in the aisle and found William standing there. He looked like something was wrong and I (and James) began speaking to him about the difficulties of being transgender. James left and William and I walked out of the church together continuing the conversation. William's transgenderism was taking place in a video game that he was playing where you could obtain different personalities, and so the question turned to how difficult it was to change that personality. We were outside of the church and approaching William's van in which he had his gaming server. He explained that it really wasn't that difficult to change personalities and all he had to do was apply a production patch and reboot the server and that it didn't cause any issues. He got in the van and left.  I walked back out to the drop-off overhang in front of the church and ran into Aiden who was holding a cup of some liquid (apple juice I think, but possibly coffee) and was going to see if I could get a ride with him. He was on the phone though, and so I didn't get a chance to speak with him. I also saw his umbrella in a rack out front to the right side of the door.  I walked back inside of the church to look for others who might be able to give me a ride. I didn't find any rides, but I went down a hallway on the left in search for a restroom.

In the distance I could see a very advanced civilization, a combination of spirituality and technology and nature, all in harmony. And Thor reached down and gently lifted my chin toward his face, and kissed me… and I woke up in my bed.

I say, “This one.” She says, “Oh I know the one you mean.” I explain that it’s for dancing and you can’t dance in crepe soles because they stick to the floor.

I recall Mary being here as another bridesmaid along with other women who I can’t remember. In another scene, I’m with a small group of women and Tad. We all have our kids. I look out the window and see a rainbow. The sky behind is dark grey and all the colors of the rainbow are very vibrant and clear. I can see the full rainbow stretching across the sky, and even note the ends where the rainbow seems to fold over itself and form a crease, like folded paper. Then Tad and I are walking with the kids to our cars near a playground. I ask him if he was also ever a fundamentalist Christian singing the Jesus Praise songs. He laughs and says yes he did that once in his life, too.",

    "text": "“The Beach Apartment” This dream starts out after something has happened and I have to go back and do this again, but I’m resistant to it throughout the whole dream. I’m having to go back to the beaches around Lake Ontario and I’m looking for an apartment. The apartment I’ve heard about belongs to someone who used to be a neighbor three doors down and I knew him from when I lived there before. I’ve heard that he has a basement apartment for rent. I make an appointment to go look at it and I walk in and am sent by his mother down into the basement. The basement is grungy. Immediately I don’t like it. It feels dirty and old. The apartment isn’t even an apartment - it’s one long room in the basement. The other two rooms have their things in them - for the grandkids. One says Crayon Room and the other room has extra tables and accessories for crayons. I’m not sure if the owner of the house is the mom or the son. The son’s got stuff in a third room. These rooms are all around the periphery. The center of the basement is open - not made into anything - and just has the laundry tubs in it, which are the older kind made of cement. He’s down there. He says, “So, what do you think?” I tell him that it’s too small, there’s only one room, I won’t be able to fit anything other than my bedroom stuff in it and I need a place for my kitchen table and a place to cook. And what if I have other friends over to study? There’s no place for us to go. It’s too small. At this point, he seems offended. I get the sense that he wants me to take the basement apartment, not just to be a renter, but he has a crush on me and it bugs me that he has an ulterior motive and it also isn’t even really a basement apartment. But that doesn't sway my opinion. I have my bag with me at the appointment looking at the basement apartment. The son engages me in conversation after I refused the apartment. He keeps talking and talking and talking and he won’t stop talking - the kind of talking where there is no p (...)",

    "text": "“The Feast” The dream is strange and hard to articulate. There are moments when I’m in the dream and moments where I’m looking down and observing the events of the dream. So it starts with being in a carpool parking lot where you're waiting for others to arrive and you leave your car there, then gather in one car. I’m standing in the parking lot waiting. The car with two people in it that I’m supposed to join arrives. I leave my car there and I don’t see it for the rest of the dream. I know one of the people in the car - my friend, Janice. She’s a paraplegic. The car has hand controls on the steering wheel. Her chair is behind me in the passenger seat. This car will only fit one other person. The other person is supposed to meet us there. We wait for a little bit and she doesn’t show up. It’s Lisa, a person I know but am no longer friends with. After we wait a little bit and decide she must not be coming and just didn't tell us, we leave and we drive down the expansive highway to where we’re supposed to be going - a wedding reception. At this point, I’m suddenly elevated above the car and watching it move along the highway. I’m not so far up that it looks like a dot on the map. Maybe it’s a birds eye view. I can see the trees. I can see the ground. I can see the roofs of houses - they aren’t that far down from my vision. So I see the car arrive in the parking lot of where the reception is supposed to be held. Then, I help get the chair out for Janice and she gets in it and we both enter into the wedding reception area. She’s sitting with different people than I am, so we part at the door. I find my seat. I’m sitting with this man. His name is James and he is the estranged brother of one of my closest friends, Maggie. He is an intolerant angry negative person. I wonder what he’s going to do next. There’s a series of platters of bread that the servers bring out from the kitchen. As they set them on the table, people start passing them to the right. Nobody is eating an (...)",

    "text": "“The Praying Mantis” My friend, Randy, asks me if I want to be part of a housing project that is on an island in the Carribean. I agree. We arrive on the island and he tells me that the house that we are going to build first, the one we can stay in and it’s not going to be on the land, it will be situated on rocks where the water flows, just off of the land. So we get off the airplane and get into a jeep. We’re riding in the jeep. One of the people that lives on the island is with us. The scenery is flat and wide and it’s hot and dusty, arid and dry. We arrive down to where the housing project will begin. True enough, as we get out of the jeep, there’s land and it’s slightly marshy and there’s a dividing line with rocks coming out from underneath the crust of land. There’s a little bit of water and it flows out from the crust like a very small stream, about 6 inches deep overtop some flat rocks. He says this is where the house will begin. There’s a number of people that live on the island that are already aware of this project. They are present. So we start to construct the house out of cement. The cement needs to be mixed. It’s poured and then it hardens. The walls are erected with these 2x4’s. The men are doing this part and Randy has already asked me previous to landing to design a garden. This is something he doesn’t know how to do himself, but I’m good at it. I’ve agreed. So while the men are doing that part, I’ve got some large pieces of paper, colored pens, and a geometry or drafting set. I start to sketch out the garden, being careful to also sketch out the house first that is not on the land at all and is not supposed to be touching the land, but is supported by the rocks. The house gets to the point where I can now help with some of the internal construction. I notice I’m wearing work boots, socks, a pair of cargo shorts, a cotton top and a cotton cap that I’ve made myself. I’m doing small construction jobs and am working the saw.

We were barricading the building to prevent any of the zombies from being able to escape. We were high up on a balcony overlooking a warehouse floor where the zombies were being held back by grated metal fences. We had an important mission which involved going out to where the zombies were briefly and climbing up a hill to high ground. I'm not sure why we needed to do this, but it was necessary to keep the hordes contained. Shad from STU was behind me, dove headfirst into a large metal vat, and returned holding a knife which he handed me. We didn't have many weapons and were low on ammo. I and two of my friends descended from the balcony to where the metal grates were and where the zombies waited eagerly for us. Snipers from above were training their reticles on the zombies below to provide us with cover when ready. We opened the gates, slipped through, and closed them. We quickly made our way up the hill, but the zombies were after us. We had to squeeze through tight, square metal openings and while I made it, both of my friends were not fast enough and were taken down. I jumped up to the top where another balcony was and was able to scramble up as the zombies were clutching at my feet. The snipers had been a big part of what had allowed me to make it.",

I get a little distracted on my phone and am not paying attention to the exits. I end up going off a sideroad and am really confused. I see gates ahead of me - like gates to a cemetery. There are a couple people standing at the gate, wearing masks and long dresses. They open the gate to let me through. I drive into the parking lot and am wondering if this will bring me back to the highway because I have somewhere to go. I’m in the parking lot of a big public meeting place - like a town hall or general community center. I park and tell my husband and my son that I’ll be right back. They stay in the car. I go inside. There’s a gathering of people. They invite me in. I take off my shoes. It’s a church service. I sit down. They’re meeting here in secret because they can't meet in the big church without being found out. So I kind of like the message and it’s kind of nice to be there, but I’m not really wanting to be here. I also realize time has passed and my husband may be upset that I didn’t come right back. I tell them that I may be back and I leave. My husband and my son are playing ball in the parking lot. Then I’m in a scene with another group of people. We are outdoors by the river at covered picnic tables. They are preparing for a wedding reception. I don’t feel like I belong here. Maybe I wasn’t invited? They are inside now and I follow.

He agreed, and then discussed moving to Australia because of the growing Jewish community there. I then saw a picture in my head of a dining commons at a Jewish institution. It was in black and white and many old-fashioned young men were clustered around tables. One of them looked like a mix between Elliot from Mr. Robot and Fabiano from STU.

I dumped the vial of the curing potion into the water, and then we began shaking the platform until all of the zombies  had fallen into the water.

It’s steep where the beach goes down into the water. I’m in a truck with a camper on the top. I’ve driven the truck to the edge where the beach heads down to the water. There are a bunch of high school classmates and people from other high schools that I grew up with - mostly guys, but a couple girls. I’m watching them surf and I’ve got my boogie board to head out to surf with them. I’m a little freaked out because the waves are big. I go out anyway and catch a few waves. The part that is causing me the most anxiety is that I’ve parked the truck right on the edge where the beach starts to head down. I need to move the truck and I’m afraid if I pull it up or back a little bit, it will start sliding down into the water. So, I get in the truck because we are all done surfing and heading to a party. I’m asking for help. I don’t want to be the one to try and drive it because I’m afraid the wheels are going to spin and I’ll slide down into the water. Then I think I do get the truck out and manage to pull it forward but not without a lot of fear and some help. The scene changes and there’s a party going on. I don't remember much about the party, except that it’s all the same people that were there at the beach with me. I feel kind of like the uninvited guest, although I was invited. My own personal feeling about it is that I don’t really belong there. It’s a typical high school party with all of us smoking, drinking and dancing. I hated those. There’s a shift in the dream.

I’ve been called by the people who hired me to do a study. It requires that I spend 30 days in a jail. I have to sleep there. So I move from the medical end of the institution where I work down to the opposite end of the building. As I walk that way, the lighting changes from that bright fluorescent that is often in hospitals to darker. The hallways are poured cement and a brownish dark grey. The walls, floor and ceiling are all made of the same thing. But it’s wide. I walk down the hallway and I’m met by some other staff. They take me into the place where I'm supposed to be spending the next 30 days. I dress in scrubs and go into the cell where they are bringing the participants in the study - there are about 6 or 7 of them, and one is a child, about age 7. We’re all sleeping on a mattress that’s been thrown down on the floor. I’m feeling into their dreams and recording them. I feel safer because there is a child on one side. The child belongs to the other person on the other side, so I think this relationship is safe. The 30 days go by and each night I arrange it so that I’m in between a child and its parent in the study, so I get by. This one woman kept speaking when she was sleeping in what sounded like a foreign language. Every night she would repeat these words and I couldn’t make out what they were. I thought they were a foreign language, but on the second to last day of the study, I realize she was saying, “Ham and cheese,” and there was really only one place in the town where they served ham and cheese and it was this restaurant.

We have a chaperone, an older matronly woman who reminds me of my mom, who has the adjoining bedroom. There’s another man who comes in - he is the head of the mafia. He’s saying to the young man I’m with, “You have to prove your worth and your smarts to get out of the contract you owe the mafia for your freedom and ability to be with her (me) and to choose.” This is the part where I move into the observer role. I’m watching as this young man performs his first task. He has to orchestrate something where he can sneak away and not be caught. There are other people who are loyal to the boss watching him, on one hand to support him in getting away, and on the other hand to stop him and report him to the boss. It’s very interesting - an initiation and test where the people involved are both rooting for this young man and going to stop him at any cost. So now we’re outside the bedroom and I’m watching him in what looks like a mall or airport bathroom with lots of stalls and entrances on two sides. He’s in there and trying to grab a pair of shoes to be able to get away. There are lockers and in one of the lockers are the mafia boss’ shoes - a very specific pair of shoes, white and made of hard plastic material. They are very precious to the boss. This younger man is trying to get them because if he can get those shoes and the car, he will have passed the test. I’m watching him plan and be very sneaky and strategic. He’s thinking, “The henchmen patrol this area at this time, so if I time it this way, I’ll miss their patrol and be able to grab these shoes.” I watch him plan it and then he does it. The boss knows that it’s going down but is letting it happen. He’s observing this w (...)",

One day you will come home and take your rightful place as Freya the goddess, and as Thor's wife.\" I asked about Thor, and Heimdallr said, \"He will be expecting to reunite with you after your work is done on Earth. Time works differently here...all exists, that's why we knew you were out in the Universe and why we were so surprised to see you made it home on your own, with no guidance or chaperone. Your powers have grown and evolved in your human form, and your DNA has been activated...\" And then I was transported home (to Earth, and my sleeping body), but my last vision showed me Asgard in glowing luminous light with two Raven's (Odin's Messengers and companions) soaring overhead (a good omen) and I woke up and I was back on my living room couch.",

I first go to a house I lived in where my daughter decided she was going to live with her boyfriend. The house is disheveled - half moved out and half not. I just ask her to sit down for a moment and explain to her where I’m going and that I’ll still have a place for her. I’ve got some of the things she didn’t take with her and still carry them and will bring them with me so there will always be a place for her to go to - there will be a designated space for her. I’m going to slide her bed up inside the wall, so I can use the floorspace for something else. When she needs her room, I’ll just bring her bed out of the wall and place it down on the floor. It won’t take very long. She seems happy with this, so I give her a hug. Then she leaves. I go down a few steps and cross over into the garage. The garage is bigger than I thought it would be and than I remembered it was. There’s a really, really long trunk in it. I open it. The rest of the stuff in there has no value to me - I’m not taking it. But I think, “What’s in that trunk?” When I open it up, it’s way bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. There are some antiques in it that belong to my grandparents. I sort a few things out from there. I remove a few things and leave some things. Then I close the trunk and I leave that house. I’ve got something else to pick up that I’ve been storing at a farm that belongs to my friend, Rob. I have to drive a different car to get there. Although, In a previous dream I’ve walked that really long expansive highway before. I’m not going to walk this time, due to lack of time, so I drive my car. As I get close to the road where Rob lives on the farm, I have to leave the highway and go off onto the farm road. I drive halfway up the road and see a woman I’ve only met once in person, but I’m involved in a proj (...)",

One had to be careful with them as they were--made of crap and caused a lot of messes when they hit the ground or hit someone. There were also some other kind of creature and it was a 50/50 split between the two.  I walked down to the ocean and found myself underneath an overhanging rocky arch. The waves crashed gently around the rocks, and lapped in the archway covering my feet. I saw that a larger wave was coming, but I didn't realize how high it was. It crashed through the opening to my right and shot me through the other side at a dizzying pace. I was quickly approaching a rock wall and was sure that I would be dashed to pieces. I hit the rock wall, but not nearly as hard as I should have. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to get back to the shore before the next waves would come. I was sure I'd be trapped. But I managed to get back to the shore.  I walked up the beach and along a road to a little parking area where my dad was with my moped. I asked to ride the moped home.",

The house is the one my ex and I owned together with my ex’s dad as our mortgage holder. My ex is not at the kitchen table, and not even in the picture. It’s just me and my ex-father-in-law talking. Initially, he’s just a total dick about it and threatening to foreclose and all that. I say to him, “You can do that, but I don’t have a place to go if you do.” My ex-father-in-law says, “Yes, well my son already has a home and all the things he needs and he has the kids.” I look at him like, “Wow. Amazing that you have zero compassion.” Then something shifts. I don’t know if I say something to him that makes him reconsider or he just reconsiders. He says, “Okay, here’s what I’m willing to do. Sell this house, then go buy a smaller house. Whatever money you need to buy the smaller house will be there for you.” So, I leave this house where we are. My ex-father-in-law makes some suggestions. He says, “There are a few houses down the road a little way in this little neighborhood that might suit you. It’s small and cute and you might like it, so go look.” I leave this kitchen table and the bigger house. I walk down the road. The rolling fields change and the scenery changes to a neighborhood with the houses quite close together. It is an established neighborhood that has been there for a while because all the trees and plants are so luscious and green. It’s definitely spring or summer because everything is leafed out and there are flowers everywhere and vines growing on houses. It is gorgeous and very alive with plant life.

We were by the side of a cliff at the edge of my complex where my device was being used to create a spider web down below the cliff and extending out several dozen feet. It had been daytime before, but now it was night. The woman was drugged or otherwise unstable, and began to fall. As she fell, she may have turned into a spider. I also felt at times as if the woman was me. I let the woman fall into the net and escape.  I left, and later Jared and Doug were talking to me and wanted to see my device. I had to tell them that they couldn't because of safety concerns. I was worried that they'd fall into the spider web as well which seemed to attract people toward it.

When evening came, one of the guys stood up to make an announcement. In whatever world we lived in, almost all parties of this kind turned into orgies around evening. Everyone had sex with everyone else. But we were Christians and wanted to be different, so the guy said, \"Alright guys, let's have fun, but don't have too much sex.\" At which point Doug who was sitting on the floor to my right, in front of a wooden table, protested as he didn't believe that anyone should be having sex before marriage. The guy decided compromised and requested that no one have sex with more than one other person. That seemed to appease everyone, and I began looking for a potential mate.   The next morning I left the house with James and my younger brother and as we walked along the driveway leading out of the gated complex, we saw a girl on the phone. She was talking to someone about her boyfriend who was being abusive. I wanted to go up to her and tell her that she needed to get out of the relationship and that there was no excuse for her boyfriend and no justification for staying. James also wanted to approach her, but his plan was to share the gospel and convince her to become a Christian. We both walked past her, but her conversation ended and she walked up to us a little on our left. James turned to her and asked her if she wanted to hear about Jesus. She clearly did not and without giving so much as a word in response placed her white headphones back into her ears and walked away.  We then got to the security gate where two guards stood.

It’s a rest area alongside the sidewalk that’s part of a row of open air type vendor areas that people would set up - similar to a festival or an open air market. So there are a number of these inhabited by other people doing things. No one is selling anything in this one - it’s simply a place where people sit and have a conversation. I have a glass of water on a raised area, a table. Someone I know comes in and sits down. I don’t notice at first that he has a pet with him. We’re having a conversation that is of no importance. It goes on around me. I’m not really engaged with it. I’m aware that Manitoulin is having with the person beside me, Adama. I notice after a few minutes that he has brought a pet with him. It comes out of his jacket pocket. At first I think it’s a snake. Its body is maybe a foot long and it’s like a long worm. It’s circumference is maybe 2-3 inches. It’s even all the way from head to tail. It sits like a snake, the way a cobra would curl up the lower part of its body and the upper part of its body would lift up. So, it’s doing this, sitting on the couch beside him and lifting its head up. It’s just kind of looking around in a very nonchalant way. It seems relaxed. Its skin is dappled, so the color underneath is maybe a light ochre and the spots which are even from head to tail are a dark terracotta. Now I see that the sunlight is hitting it. Strangely, when the light hits it, you can’t see the contrast between the markings and its more a dry brown glass color. I think this is interesting. Now I'm watching it interact with its environment and I’m really not interested in the conversation that’s happening around me. I’m partly struck by awe that I don’t know what this is - it’s new and I’m watching it - as well as a little bit of fear because it also looks somewhat like a snake and I’m slightly afraid of snakes.

I questioned this, but was told that this was not going to cause any problem and that they'd be comfortable.  I began to realize that Carleigh should be dead and that I must be dreaming.",

I’m lying down on my back. I can’t tell where I am. There’s a mother ferret and six of her babies lying on my stomach. The babies are little and I’m protecting them. The mother is very content and happy to lie there with me and have me guard them. So I’m lying still. The babies are slowly growing - I’m watching them grow and am being very protective. The man with me is also being protective. I’m not exactly sure where I am - it seems to be outside on the grass. All of these members from my old CrossFit gym and other CrossFit gyms show up. They really want a workout, but it’s the time of coronavirus, people can’t really gather and the gyms are all closed. But all of these people are close to each other - definitely not 6 feet away. They’re gathered around me and I’m definitely still vulnerable because I’m laying on the ground with all of these ferret babies on my tummy. These CrossFit people want a workout and music. I have my iPhone with a playlist that I can play. But I’m telling them: “My playlists are for pole classes. It’s not your normal CrossFit playlist.” They don’t care. They’re adamant that they get a workout. So, it’s either the man I’m with or me telling them to run an obstacle course. It’s kind of like a free for all on this obstacle course. Somebody is trying to win and there aren’t any rules, so people holding other people back and stuff like that happening. But I say, “Okay, the winners get some of these ferrets.” During this whole time, the ferrets are getting bigger and bigger and bigger. Two of them get to be adult size. I put a collar and leash on them and give them away. Along with this man, there are a couple of other people around me - I can’t tell if it’s my kids or somebody else’s kids. So I give those two ferrets to these children. They go off with them. So there  (...)",

The thing that made it odd is that when I woke up, I was frozen and thought I actually had a little girl with me and the only dream I had last night was with my ex throwing my son’s camping equipment in the garbage. It was like a dream in a dream. When I thought I was awake, the dream I recalled was going camping and spreading a round blanket out on the ground, and then sleeping bag on top of that. This is what my son slept in. His dad was to pick him up that day and take him overnight from the campground. So I rolled up the ground sheet and the round blanket. There was another layer, like a spongy mat you sleep on top of. They were all circular. I rolled them all up and put them in the back of my son’s dad’s car. Instead of them actually driving away, I’m in the backseat. As I see them approach his house, he pulls over first. It’s like a dumpster in the back of a store - a really big kind for large stores. He takes the roll of my son’s sleeping stuff out of the trunk and throws it in the dumpster. I said, “What are you doing? Why would you do that?” He said, “Because it was dirty.” I say, “That’s what washing machines are for.” He just shrugged his shoulder and said it doesn’t matter. I said, “It does matter! We go camping all the time. I’m going to need that.” He just didn’t respond. So I took a piece of paper and wrote down the three items on it and put them in my son’s pocket and said, “Next time we go camping, you’re going to have to replace that.” Then, a few minutes later, I checked my son’s pocket. The note was gone and his dad had thrown it in the garbage. This was very upsetting to me. Then I arrived home. My son didn’t even stay overnight at his dad’s, we just got out of the car and came back into my house. I am in the living room of my house and just sitting there. All of a sudden, this family appears around me. In the dream, they’re mine, but they aren’t my actual family. There are parents and they t (...)",

L. was also there, as was a black man whose name I don't know, though his brother was W.W.B. Both D. L. and WWB's brother were potential suitors to Katie and were still hanging around.  D. L. wanted to be with Katie because Katie was very conservative and one of D. L.' personal goals or challenges was to get into a relationship with someone who was highly conservative just to show that he could do it. It was clear that his intentions were not good.  WWB's brother was just hanging around being creepy.  Out of the sky to our left, we saw a plane approaching. It was a small, silver dual-propeller plane and WWB was in it and was coming to support his brother and give his approval for his marriage.  As the plane approached, the dream became a cinematic film and transitioned to black and white. The plane hit the ground and shattered into a mass of grey metallic particles. William and I discussed how the animation was cheap.  The dream transitioned (or this is a new dream) and William and I were in a building where voting for the marriage of Aiden and Katie had taken place. It turned out that William had rigged the voting to ensure Aiden would win.  Then we were at our house and it was raining. I was in the back porch wearing my pajamas and had to get out to the garage to get something. I got there only getting minimally wet as I was able to hold something over my head. I opened the door, ducked inside, and found what I was looking for. On the way out, I shut the garage door with the panel on the wall and jumped over the laser sensor which detects movement and reopens the door.   I got back inside and was only slightly damp.",

We approached a house on our left which was two stories and dilapidated. We pulled the car into the driveway and were debating whether or not to approach the door. I think that I had to use the restroom and was going to look for one while waiting for my mom to knock on the door.  We did go up to the door together and my mom knocked. We waited for a few minutes and no none answered. We knocked again, and eventually a 5 year old Hispanic boy opened the door. For some reason, we began to suspect that his father was abusive or a drug dealer. We pretended to be DSS agents and began speaking with the boy in an attempt to surreptitiously find out if our impressions were true.  His father showed up but didn't speak English so we continued to speak with the boy in English so that his father would not understand. I can't remember, but we might have planned to leave and secretly call the cops.",

I’m in charge of making a meal for these children that are coming in. It’s a soccer clinic and all of these younger children are a part of it. It’s a mix of boys and girls and I think they’re all between the ages of 8 and 12. I’m supposed to be preparing the food, but also making sure there’s enough for everyone. There’s probably 50 kids coming through to eat. I’m working on it. The deadline is getting closer for the time I need to have the food prepared. It’s not totally prepared. There’s an interesting piece happening here where I have a basket of feathers - they could be chicken and raven feathers. I am taking the feathers and sewing them one at a time onto this food and it makes the food more abundant. So, I’m full on doing spells here - totally witchy. I’m realizing I’m running out of time, though. This man I know comes in. He says, “I’ll help you get this fixed up.” He comes in. His energy is very jarring to me. He grabs a bunch of feathers, and instead of helping make the food more abundant, he starts on this art project with the feathers. He’s talking the whole time - fucking windbag taking us so much air and space. He’s saying, “We need to listen to this music,’ and he puts this music on. It’s kind of jazzy and reminds me of the band Pink Martini from Portland. He is ruining the flow and I don’t like it. Now I’m really not getting things done. The thing is he’s so earnest and he thinks he’s helping. But of course, my self-reflection is, oh why do you have to be a bitch about it? But he’s not fucking helping. And he’s just taking up so much space and hijacking it. The kids start to come in now. The food is not ready. He says, “It’s okay kids!

Then, we go into the foyer. It appears a lot smaller than it did when I was little. I comment on how much smaller it is. The box or table I’ve brought isn’t going to fit very well because I underestimated the size of the space. But then Elizabeth takes me under the stairs and says, “See how tall the ceiling is?! It’s always been this tall.” Then I say, “Yes, so tall!” Then I look at the stairs and remember how we would slide down the stairs. I also remember how we would play under the stairs and the memories are delightful. Then I go out the front door. I have a mission - somewhere to go, someone to find or something to discover. So I leave Elizabeth at her house and go off on my own. I can’t recall much about the journey. Then I am arranging to meet up with Margarent for an acupuncture healing. I go up the stairs and knock on her door. She opens the door. Her office is very narrow and there are no walls - it just drops off into space. She doesn’t have any tables, so she is no longer doing acupuncture. She has a big rolling chair that she sits at her desk. I look and think, oh my gosh, she has to be very aware all the time and not push too far back, or else she’ll just fall off the edge of the world into space. So I sit down. I look around and tell her, “Oh, I have been studying Egyptian spirituality and also very interested in bears. I’ve been thinking of bears and dreaming of bears.” She’s delighted and does a cackling laugh. Then she sits me down next to all of her bear paraphernalia that she has collected recently because she too has been in communication with the bears and the ancestors. She has a bronze bear and a stuffed teddy bear and other miniatures. As I sit down, the stuffed teddy bear turns to look at me. It is sitting over my left shoulder.

    "text": "“The Language” This dream is a little complicated to explain. The best way I can lay out the architecture is that it’s kind of like a spiral. The first layer, when I go through it, I’m not quite in it, then each layer I'm a little deeper in. There’s also a vehicle for getting there and I don’t know how to describe it. It doesn't move on the land. It’s not an airplane. It doesn’t go way high up in the sky. It hovers a little above the rooftops - perhaps the layer where birds are normally in, though I don’t see any birds in the dream. It moves really quickly. It moves through time, as well. So the dream begins. I’m exiting out of this vehicle into a town. I’m walking around the town looking for where I’m supposed to be. I don’t understand any of the language being spoken. So, I can’t ask anyone where to go. I’m just trying to feel my way around. I’m looking for a mental map of the things I need. For example, I’m looking for a place to eat, a place to study, a place to sleep. So the first time I go through here, I’m feeling ungrounded. I’m alienated because I don’t speak the language. But I’m starting to feel familiar with the urban landscape. There's a certain time I have to leave. I need to be back at that vehicle. So I’m rushing to get there. I get back in it and I leave. Then I re-enter that same town, exiting the vehicle. This time I’m looking for parks and recreational places. I’m looking for a place to swim and rest outside - not necessarily a beach, but a place I can rest after swimming. This time I have my son with me. We have found a place to rent bicycles and have rented a tandem bicycle. So I place my son on the back and I’m on the front. We both have little backpacks with what we need for the day. We are just leisurely riding around. We go to the place for swimming, not an ocean, I have a feeling it might be man made because it’s too small to be a lake. It’s quite beautiful.

The water is black from the storm and the night I see this animal that looks like a dead whale being pushed around on the waves. I struggle up to the whale to see if it is alive and if it could be saved. I know it is dangerous, but I do it anyway. As I reach to hold the whale, it turns into a prehistoric or alien creature, close in size to a sea turtle, but alien in shape and texture. Now I’m trying to keep a hold of this creature and bring us both to the shore. I see other people I know in the water and we are all diving under the waves to swim in calmer depths. When I come up for breath, I notice people in rowboats. They are not good people. They are wanting to capture this creature and take it from me. I need to work harder to hold on and swim deep under the water to safety. They see me one time when I go get a breath of air, and I feel like I’m in grave danger. Somehow I get away. I reach an underwater city. I open a door into an empty room and then go through another door to a cobbled street. I am still underwater, but can breathe and move easily. I must keep going and hold this creature close to me because they could get me at any moment. Then in another part of the dream, I am with my friend, George and a friend of his who I don’t know. I have a phone and an iPad. We need to get to a concert and the address and transportation information about the buses are on the devices. I’m worried that it’s time to go and we might miss the first bus. George says, “Don’t worry, we’ll make it.” Then I say I have to put on my makeup. He says, “You don’t need to wear makeup girl.

We have to clean up the store to prepare it for the next day. There’s an interesting split between how much the men and women are cleaning up. The work is getting done, but the small details keep getting missed by the men and the women clean up after them. The dream shifts a little bit out of the grocery store to another room, maybe a home because there’s a home office and what looks like a home entertainment room. I’m watching a man who is a BDSM trainer and you can book sessions with him. There’s also a gorgeous super curvy black woman and it’s her birthday. Her husband has booked a session with this pornstar BDSM trainer. His name is King Noire. She’s so freaking excited and it’s so cute to see her exclaim, “Yeah, I’m going to get hit with a paddle!” She’s really excited that this is her birthday gift and her husband is excited for her, too. Now we’re in what looks like an underground garage. She’s in some short shorts with a skirt over top and a regular top on. She’s walking down a ramp. There are other people getting ready for the scene. She’s so excited. She drops her purse and when she goes to pick up her skirt, it rides up. She’s wearing shorts, so you can’t see anything, but she’s like, “Oh my!” Her husband is standing behind her.

The bridge goes over a many laned highway that is really busy with a lot of cars - maybe 8 lanes. I arrive at a house that’s been empty for a few years. It’s where my daughter’s grandparents used to live. They’ve both passed on. When I go inside the house, my mother-in-law, Roberta, is there. Her two daughters - my daughter’s aunts - are there as well. The two aunts are still living. My daughter has arrived. We are all meeting there. Roberta has made tea. It’s in a big pot with a round belly - like a china pot. It’s a good tea pot - white ceramic with curves and lines and roses. On the tray with the teapot are matching teacups and saucers, also made of china. They are very delicate. Each one has a different pattern motif. There’s a tray of cupcakes, too, and cookies on the table. She invites us to sit down. There’s not enough room on the couch, so my daughter and I sit on the floor. We have tea and a nice chat. We can even see dust particles as the sun shines in through the window - I can see them dancing all over everything. After we have tea and cakes and talk for a little bit, she instructs one of her daughters to get this big photo chest out. It’s about 2x1x1 and has got handles that drop down. She gets it and sets it on the floor beside the table. Then, she opens it and the aunts start taking out some pictures. The pictures are all black and white and are just in the chest, not in an album. They have the white cropped edge of photographs from the 1930s or 40s. As the aunts get them out, they are exclaiming over them, and they are bringing out a stream of memories. My daughter is absorbing her matrilineal family histories as these stories are shared. There’s one point where I’m a little bit surprised at Roberta’s description. They aren’t just photographs of the family from her side, but she also has photographs of (...)",

It's covered with some kind of bizarre writing that's not alphabetic or hieroglyphic. It did not resemble any script that I knew of. The characters aren't very tall, less than a centimeter, and they wrap all the way around the vessel. The outer surface of the jar is thin layer of clay is separate from the body, and can be made to rotate separately. It's like a skin that is a little loose.

Each person is dropped off at their house and the train continues down the tracks. I arrive at my house - a shared co-op style home. I’m putting away the groceries. There are other people in the kitchen with me. Then I’m in a more public space. I have to go the bathroom and am uncomfortable because I no longer like to use public restrooms because of the fear of other people’s lack of health or cleanliness. I go into the bathroom and see that the toilet lid and seat are covered in purple bubble wrap. I need to pull it off and put on new purple bubble wrap. I do this but am frustrated because the person before me didn’t do her job in cleaning up after herself. I lift the lid up and see that someone has defecated but not bothered to flush. Now I have a handful of purple bubble wrap, but still need to flush the toilet, then use the toilet, and somehow not contaminate myself. It’s frustrating and I don’t think I ever do use the bathroom. I’m looking for a trashcan to throw all this stuff out, then wash my hands and leave. Then I go out to the lawn. There’s a group of people singing songs. I join them. One of the songs is so wonderful that it makes me leap up and dance. I’m the only one dancing in the green grass and under the bright blue sunny sky. I’m feeling so happy alive, to be outside, to be dancing, and to be feeling free. Even though others are still not dancing, I do not hold myself back from this joy. Then later on, I’m inside a big building. There are a lot of people beginning to gather for a dance. The large group is subdivided into several smaller groups. There are rules for this dance. You have to wait to be chosen. My smaller group has two different leaders - a black man and a white woman. They are one-by-one choosing people to enter the dance. The other smaller groups are doing the same. So with each person, the dance floor gets more crowd (...)",

The last student was a small boy of 5 or 6 years old and I was walking him out of the building to the pickup truck of the principal who was going to give him a ride home. I was a bit suspicious of the principle for some reason, but I let the boy go and I went back inside.  Back within the school building, I found that I had been trapped inside. The doors were locked and there was no way out. But I wasn't sure yet that they knew that I knew that I had been trapped. I planned to confront the principal and kill him using some ingenious plan. Unfortunately, the school was devoid of weapons or any object that would be easy to use as a lethal instrument of blunt force.  I walked toward a supply closet and entered it, and to my surprise I found a woman within. She was black and cat-like. It's hard to describe her, but she kept transitioning back and forth between my cat Mischief and her human form. She carried a purse and within it I could hear pill bottles rattling around. My plan formed immediately: I would take the pills, crush them, pour them all into the principal's coffee, and offer it to him. He still didn't know that I knew I was trapped so he wouldn't be suspecting a thing.  Then I had sex with the cat-woman thing and the dream ended before I could kill poison the principal. Rather climactic and anti-climactic at the same time!",

I went to get Daniel and as I did a fire alarm went off indicating that there was a tornado. We both went outside to look around, and while extremely windy, we couldn't see it yet. I told Daniel that we needed to get back inside because the tornado might be invisible until it touched the ground. It was so windy that I wasn't sure if I could make it back inside.

It’s nighttime - an unusual time for surgery. When the surgery is over the man says it’s okay for us to go visit her. As I go into the bedroom, I see there are big potted plants - they look like plumeria trees, but aren’t. I’m surprised because just during the short amount of time of the surgery, bright yellow flowers have bloomed on bright yellow stalks. I’ve never seen this before and didn’t know this plant could grow such flowers. I point it out to another woman who is equally amazed. At first I think it was just one big tree, then I see that the “tree” is actually made up of multiple potted plants and maybe these flowers were just brought in, rather than a miracle. Then I see Mary is waking up. The man comes up to me and tells me she will need hot chocolate or matcha for an endorphin boost. He asks if I have either of those in my kitchen, and I think I do - though I’m staying in a rental house and am not sure about what is in the cupboards. He says “Okay, that’s great.” Mary is starting to come back around and is looking around, refreshed but weak. We gather her up and help her out to the kitchen. We need to get her home to rest and have her hot chocolate or matcha. Conversations are happening in the kitchen, but I can't recall what was said. Now we need to get dinner because we missed it while she was in surgery. So we go outside to a village (like Squaw Valley) and down big steps to a dessert cafe. We stand in line at the cafe and I’m now with one of my yoga students and clients, Natalie, and another yoga student. I look in my pockets and realize I don’t have any money.

He was speaking in a very high pitched voice and this indicated that he wasn't entirely well though it was also nothing serious.  But then I heard the things that the therapist was saying to my brother which were terribly wrong and damaging. It must have been that he was having serious issues or was insane. I got angry and grabbed the phone and went on a long rant where I explained to the therapist how he was wrong. I used my examples of having hypnogogic hallucinations and anxiety to show that while my brother may be on the outside edges of what is considered normal, he wasn't at all psychotic. I think the therapist was also interpreting my brother's dreams incorrectly when the right interpretations were obvious to me knowing my brother.",

One morning, everyone but me decided to go on a social outing, and I, being more introverted and suffering from social anxiety, decided to stay behind in the motel room. But I wanted to grow personally, so I went out and about and found a nice little coffee shop. I ordered a cup of coffee and met with an old acquaintance. After he left, a homeless man came in from the streets. He had brown hair and a long, unkempt beard. He approached me and at the same moment, my brother William ran by in front of me from the right, and coming to a skidding stop in front of the homeless man embraced him. I got up and moved closer to the door where they were hugging and was unsure of what to do. After a few seconds, I joined the hug, though a bit awkwardly.   Later that day we went to a restaurant and we me the homeless man again, but this time he pretended as if he had never met us. We met him again later that day and he did the same thing.  That afternoon, we went to the resort's water park and found that it was a small, filthy swimming hold with a dilapidated metal slide going down about fifty feet into the water. In the water was a Hispanic family who we saw clearly and a few other people in the background. I went down and spoke with the family and we discussed the water depth as well as their desire to be on TV. There was filming going on and if anyone was in the right place at the right time, doing something interesting, they might end up in a move or TV show.  I walked away and Robert from small group approached me and made some joke about how the family was \"cesspooling\" as if this were a normal activity. I retorted in jest that we should let them know where the nearest water treatment plants were so that they could find more suitable water.",

The drafting boards take up a lot of room - it’s like they’re almost side to side. There are more people than drafting boards, so the excess people make it feel really packed. I feel like I have some kind of amnesia as I sit in front of my drafting board. I don’t know what I'm supposed to be drawing. So I start to circulate amongst the people. It’s all hazy. I don’t know anyone, I don’t know why I’m there, I don’t know what I’m supposed to draw. I’m approaching some of the people. I’m climbing over other people that are just sitting there. It’s literally packed with people. I’m hearing rather than seeing that some people are involved in a conversation with their drafting board. I realize that even though you can’t really see what they’ve drawn, the conversation they are having with it is they are telling it their life story, but there are too many details to draw. So there’s another kind of media that produces an imprint on the drafting board, the person who is the architect of their life. Then I have some kind of idea of what is supposed to be on mine and I make my way back to it, but then I can’t remember what I’m supposed to put on it. I know there’s a conversation, but I don’t have enough of an idea of what mine is in order to begin the conversation that will imprint upon my drafting board. So in an effort to discover more detail, I leave the orchestra pit adn I start to walk towards a building. I realize the building is a hospital. I enter in the front door.

We’re working at one of those Macy style department stores, or at least they’re working. I work there, too, but I’m there on my day off. We’re talking. I’m looking for a pair of shoes to wear. I’m barefoot and I don’t think you’re ever supposed to be barefoot in those kinds of stores, but I am. There’s an interesting dynamic going on. I know I don’t really have the money to pay for the shoes, but I’m looking anyway so I know how much they are and I can save up for them. There’s some other way that I’m helping these co-workers. I don’t know if it’s an energetic helping or if I’m doing some sort of mentoring with them. They’re both younger women. I’m helping them with an emotional thing. This part isn’t super clear.

It starts at the pier. I’m just standing there. I don’t know if I’m at a really large lake or an ocean. I’m just watching. I’m looking at the water. You can’t see land when you look forward. The water just keeps going. It’s a sunny day. I can see where the light is hitting the water and making those beautiful diamonds. It’s also very balmy and a bit windy. I’m enjoying the feel of that on my skin. It’s sunny, but not sweltering. There are large barges that occasionally pass by in the vista that my eyes are feasting upon. They’re really far away in the distance. Some people gather around me. I realize I’m kind of part of a group. The group is moving from the pier to somewhere else. I’m being told that it’s time to go. Somebody is in charge - I think - and is telling people it’s time to move from this place to another place. I reluctantly move inside with the group. I never see the entire building.

Some people are chasing other people. Someone falls into the river and is nearly drowned by the water and other people holding his head down. Later, people are recovering on the riverbank around bonfires. There are two bonfires near each other. I can see that the outline of the further fire is making outlines of mystical beings. People are being divided into expedition teams to go out into the night again. Then, the COVID/Outlander/Simpsons scene: sometimes the people are portrayed as Simpson cartoons with medical masks. They are also wearing masks in their human form. There are several reunions - it’s like my dream psyche is trying on different scenarios to find the most romantic storyline. One is a kitchen, one is a cave and one is a rock pillar tower underground. Each scene has a collection of colored rocks and Claire and Jamie meeting again for the first time in 11 years with the big embrace and kiss. They are looking at the rocks - plain rocks, but colored naturally in yellows, reds and blues like the rocks at the river near The Painted Hills - in waking life, we went to this river last weekend. While the kiss is happening, the boys walk in. Jamie and Claire have a son and he has two friends - the sons of Jamie’s wife. Their son is happy, but the other two are angry. The kids are Simpson characters. The brothers run off to tell their mom and create danger and drama for the two lovers, interfering with the bliss of their r (...)",

She went with the US and took a helicopter ride there. When she touched down, it wasn't in the lush forests but in an arid desert canyon with a cold stream running down a steep hill. Many tourists were in the area and wanted to meet Aurora, but she went down by herself to a small rounded area down by the stream where the ground was covered in river stones and fallen trees. She rolled over the trees playfully. There wasn't much of a distinction between myself and her at the end of the dream.",

I stepped away from the computer and discussed what had happened with Harold. We were in a hotel and I left the room and had a debate with someone about Calvinism where I eloquently attacked it while defending the Arminian position. I don't remember the arguments now, but at the time of waking I recalled that my arguments had been reasonably sound.  We left the hotel and found ourselves in my town's downtown.

They were hidden everywhere. They’d come out everywhere. You could just be walking in the city, then there's this place hidden in plain sight and it’s a portal into these subterranean chambers and also coming back out. They’re hidden, but if I lift something up, I can see them. But they don’t look like they should be lifted. You have to know to lift it to see what’s underneath. Then there’s a tunnel or some kind of portal into the labyrinth. When I see the hidden places, I can't just go lift up the top, I have to ask the teacher. There’s some person in there. People aren’t supposed to touch these things. But I’m not in a class, so I don’t understand that. At one point I see one and I lift it without asking. I almost get in trouble. I finally found the end of it where all of them go to or come from. It’s like a giant hot tub. I pulled open the top and it was steaming and swirling but also dirty looking, almost like a sewer. I could not figure out how people go in there and then almost had to swim under to then find the space to pop up in. It just looked really gross and I couldn’t figure out how people breathed in it. At one point, the teacher or leader says something about me as I’m walking away - I think it’s when I apologized for opening one of them without asking and they were like, oh it’s okay okay. So as I’m walking away, they said to the person, “She’s my victim.” I was like, “What the fuck? No I’m not.”",

I have a little hesitancy about this because it’s enough of a drive for me that I’m thinking that by the time I get there, I’m going to have to turn around and come back or sleep overnight, which I haven't been invited to do. I’m wondering if I really want to drive basically all night only to stay for an hour. But because I think I should go, I get in my car after putting a few things together in a bag. A couple of things are what you would bring as a hostess gift. I think there’s a bottle of wine - there’s something in a bottle anyway - and something else wrapped up in a small bag. In fact I’ve got a couple of other small bags. When I arrive I just park the car. I’ve never been to this house before. I walk in and see some people that I don’t know very well but I recognize them. There's about 10 or 15 of these. I see that there’s a friend I used to be close to, but am no longer. I see that Omar’s brother, Mike is there. I haven't seen him in a long time. He’s the one person I do have warm feelings towards. So I go sit beside him.

Then it appears that the meal is about to start and we’re asked to take our seats. Unfortunately, there’s a seating plan and I have to look for where my name is. I see that I’m seated beside a woman I used to be close with and am no longer, and the person on the other side is someone I don’t know. So I’m not very happy about this.

Their gait was awkward and they may have been wearing a special kind of shoe or device to help them walk. By the time they got closer to us, we could see that they were conjoined twins. Pretty much a normal person, but with two heads and necks.   They walked across the courtyard toward us, and as they drew near, I really wanted to speak with them. I wanted to know what it was like to be conjoined twins. Who got to eat? Did they have a significant other? are the questions I remember thinking in the dream. But I was too nervous to ask them. William, on the other hand, went right up to them and began asking them questions. They sat down on a park bench and a whole crowd congregated around to hear about their experiences.",

On the other side of the stream bed is a hill you can climb up and once you get to the top of that hill, you can look out over the land and see Mauna Kea and Haleakala and you can see the coast. The lava rock desert is on the other side of this hill and it is the actual landscape I grew up with and it is the landscape that shows up in this dream. So, I’m in the backyard with my father.

Is there a trust fund? Is she going to give them to each of her kids? What is happening with them? He says, “She’s going to sell them all before she dies.” I remember thinking, Why. Her whole point was that she wanted to own one house for each of her seven kids to bequeath to them. It surprises me that she’s going to sell them.

There are two other people aside from her that also don’t have actual rooms. While this discussion is occuring in the spa pool. I’m thinking that if we just rearrange the rooms a little bit with who’s sleeping where, there would be room for everyone and everyone would have a bed. It might be better not to move because moves are disruptive and the next house is going to have similar problems as this one, unless it’s possible to find a low ranch style home. So I voice my suggestion. So some people move downstairs and other people from the kitchen move up to the top floor. The patriarch doesn’t have to climb any stairs. This way when we do the shuffle, there is room for everyone, including the people sleeping in the kitchen. The family agrees this is a good idea. After the pool, we go into the house to tell the girl that’s been sleeping in the kitche (...)",

We pulled into a gas station, and it took us ages to get the car filled up. A woman walked by us and indicated that she was unhappy that we'd been sitting there so long. I realized that we should probably get going, and I told Jared. Jared started up the engine, but before we could pull out, a black man walked up and stood in front of the car. He hit the top of the hood with his hand. This pissed Jared off, and Jared began to pull forward and to the right. The guy had plenty of time to move, but he didn't, and Jared purposefully hit him. He fell to the ground crying out in pain, but he was clearly not injured. He had baited Jared so that he could use him after pretending to be hurt. I turned to Jared and said, \"You really shouldn't have done that.\" I may have also said, \"You really are stupid.\", but I can't remember the exact phrasing.  Jared freaked out and zipped out of the parking lot to the right as fast as he could. I was annoyed because I was stuck in the car with him and knew that the police would soon be after us. I knew that at this point, Jared would be on the run from the law and that we'd never see him again.  Jared dropped me off at a breakfast restaurant like a Waffle House or IHOP, and I joined a group of my friends for breakfast. I told them what had happened and how this was going to be the end of our friendship. This was just too much.   Later, I ran into Jared in another restaurant, but it may have been years in the future and our friendship was not restored and he might have been on the run still.",

I'm saying to somebody, prior events forgotten, and there were prior events, I could walk home from here in an hour and a half. Problem, it isn't home any more, meaning the house in which I grew up on Princeton. Other people are living in that house now. [n.b. in reality it wold not take that long] Whidbey Island. I'm with someone. We looked at some old house, that was a B&B? It's quite dilapidated, and not in an interesting way, nor is the architecture interesting. It's an old cottage, with several rooms. I go in to a bedroom, and there's a toilet in the bedroom next to the bed. The bed pillow has fallen into the toilet, which has a lot of old pee in it, and the pillow has sucked up the water and pee. It stinks, and it is hideous. I suspect there's pee on the floor, too, from the smell. I tell this to the person I was with. We stop at another little house, this one is not disgusting, but there are quite a few people there, mostly Hispanic. They're about to do some hallucinogen. Three's a pot of some liquid. Much forgotten. This one guy... they look like red grapes, but are almost the size of golf balls. This guy eats several of them with a very strange motion of his mouth, like his lips become an extended proboscis going forward six or eight inches, and he sucks them up that way. I don't intend to take any of the drug, but I'm thinking I would stay and watch. Then we're heading back to Clinton to take the ferry. It's more suburban than in reality, and a big glitzy car dealership is near the ferry dock, on the right side as you go down the hill, with a big sign, Indianapolis something. A fair bit of traffic. I'm looking at quite an old house, 1880's, perhaps. It's like a small Brooklyn house, but nothing on either side. Brick, very upright, no windows in the sides.

We had teenage kids that were undisciplined and ran all over the place with friends who drank underage. I really didn’t like it. The dream setting is this house that belonged to my ex. I’m trying to create a space in it that has some privacy for me. Up on the second floor it was like a room but only had three walls. The fourth wall was part of the stairwell, so it was like a big niche. I hung a curtain up to create a fourth wall and I had a doorway so I could go into my room. I put a bed in it. I had my toiletries - toothbrush, hairbrush, hair dryer and something else for hair - I don’t know what it was because I actually don’t own anything for hair but they were symbolic of something in my dream. I had clothes hanging and it felt like a lot of stuff for one small space. One day when I was sitting in my room brushing my hair, two teenage boys came up. They were fiddling with the hair things - picking them up and setting them down. They were curious and seemed innocent. I explained to them that they were to clip hair back into a ponytail. They said, oh, then put them down and picked up something else and asked what it was for. I would patiently explain it to them. They just kept innocently picking things up and putting them down. Then they got to the hair dryer and other thing that both had electrical cords and switches. They kept turning the switches off/on, off/on. Then I noticed that they’d taken some things from behind me when I was speaking with one of them. I could see it out the little window now. They were using them in a different room. I picked up the electronic items and went to use them and they were both broken. I began to cry. I realized that they’d torn a bunch of other stuff out of my room without asking me and were just being destructive with it. I approached them and said: “You’ve broken my things and you should  (...)",

It's a writing class. I've done this assignment that I wrote out earlier in the dream, typed up. I'd folded it in half and put it in a manila envelope, and I write on it, teacher's name, a gift. But it was just my assignment. Now it's class time. I'm there, and it's been opened, and some other student is reading it. I'm not happy about that. I reflect that it was foolish to write \"a gift\" on it. Apparently the assignment wasn't complete. She wanted not just the piece of writing, but some more writing around that. I talk to her and say, so you want to know why I wrote that instead of something else. She says you're a master of fonts. I thought that was odd as I had not used any unusual fonts in my work, but I don't take up the point, and merely thank her and say, fonts are fun. There isn't any place for me to sit. The room is square, with various tables and chairs, but the only place vacant is at a high table that is slightly slanted. There is a stool to sit on, but it's too high for the table, and to sit in it would have been awkward. The teacher offers to me and other students the opportunity to work in another Room downstairs, but no one takes her up on it. Something about pants and a coat. For some reason I wasn't wearing the pants I'd intended to. So I look for the right pants, and find them in a heap with a black denim jacket. The pants are also black denim. The other students look askance at me.",

I’m with a couple other people - I’m not sure who they are, but there’s a friendship vibe. They’re searching for clothes to wear. One of them is a woman. She finds a green dress with multiple layers to it - a sheath dress part, then a lace overlay. The lace is really frilly with lots of ruffles and volume and not tailored - it’s more of an A-line. She puts it on. It looks fine on her. It looks alright. But I’m thinking, “Well, you always wear that kind of stuff. It’s not particularly form fitting. I don’t think it shows off your beauty fully. I don’t think it actually expresses who you are.” But she likes it, so she’s wearing it. Then there’s this group of other people. We’re standing at a rack where we’ve pulled the dress from and they’re watching us. It’s like the most purposefully diverse group of people - someone in a wheelchair, all ethnicities, skin colors, gender identifications and sexual orientations. I don’t know how I know this. I just know this. So it’s my turn and I’m like, “Okay, I’ll try this dress on.” The group is like, “No, don’t. That’s an ugly dress. It’s kind of like the same shit you always wear or think you want to wear. Don’t try it on.” But I’m like, “No, I want to try it on!” I’m wearing a pair of jeans. I put the sheath part over my jeans. Already I think this doesn’t look good - Why would you wear a sexy form fitting sheath dress over jeans? But I’m just trying this on. The crowd is shaking their heads no at me. But I’m going to do this. They’re pretty adamant, like “Could you just listen to us already? We already know. Just don’t do it.” So then I pull on the second part of the dress. Of course it looks terrible. It’s a little bit frumpy with the ruffles and lace and sheer mesh. It doesn’t look good on me, it’s definitely not my style. They’re like, “Okay, so t (...)",

The deeper part of this dream is me on an airplane. It’s showing up in flashes. There’s one part where I’m in an airport. I’m looking at the arrival and departure boards to find my flight and the gate. There are people bustling all around me. There are gross fluorescent lights everywhere. Shops, too. It’s busy - no social distance is happening, so I don’t know if it is this time or another because everyone is close. No masks. It’s normal. Then I go from looking at this board to being in the airplane and in my seat. I’m on the end of the middle row where there are three seats in a row. There’s an aisle and then two more seats and a window. There are people all around me that I’m sorting of chatting with. I’m with a group of others, I think. I have this sense of keeping track of the other people. I’m sitting in my chair. You know how on long flights your shit ends up everywhere - that’s happened. I can’t find my sweater. We’ve landed and it’s time to disembark but I can’t find my sweater. I’ve taken up two seats in this airplane and it seems to be fine because there was no one near me.

One of them is the person that I’ve picked up this thing from the store for. There’s an exchange of money that goes on. I’m trying to divide it up evenly - the change. The first time I count it all out and give half to the other person and keep half for myself. I count it and I’m missing money, so I ask if I can have all the money back. I put it all together and look at it again. There’s a couple of fives, a ten, and a twenty. I see that the twenty actually should belong to me. I should be keeping that because I paid for the item.

While I’m looking at this rat, part of me is like, “eww, it’s a rat,” and another part of me is like, “well, if I squint, maybe it will look more like a cat. That will be more acceptable.” It’s clear that this rat very much loves us. I can feel myself trying to love it back, but it’s a rat and it’s so hard. Then the scene changes. Now I’m in a home. The part of the home I’m in is like a tower. It has windows on three or four sides. It’s a square room with a round table in the center. It’s not really big - maybe 10 or 12 feet across in all directions. One side of the room does open up into the rest of the house and is bigger. There is sunshine streaming in through the windows, blue sky and white puffy clouds. It’s gorgeous. I’m having a conversation with my ex father in law who says he’s either moving to Hawaii or is already living in Hawaii. In this conversation, I feel like he’s not giving me a lot of choice in the matter. It feels frus (...)",

I go down a hill, there's gravel, and I get to the bottom, and there's a street. I'm going to walk north. Don't recall where I intended to go. A wide, concrete street, not much traffic. residential neighborhood, light commercial, large deciduous trees in leaf ringing the intersection. It all seems oddly vacant. Very little if any traffic. A large traffic island covered in grass that is oddly hummocky, up to maybe a dozen feet, and several dozen feet in either direction. Something very creepy about it. I get the sense that it's alive, or there's something alive in it, that's quite large. I spot a very large animal that at first I think is a dinosaur. It walks on four legs. At first it seems not to have any hair or fur. It's walking, and I believe it sees me, I'm quite concerned now, and start to move quickly in the opposite direction. It begins to follow me, but next I'm around the corner of a building with the creature around the far corner to the left. It sticks its head out beyond the corner. The head is at least three feet long. When it puts its head beyond the corner, it sees me and is afraid of me, and starts going in the other direction. Now I'm curious. As it walks away I look at it intently. It has brown fur and it's shambling away rather rapidly and looks back at me. I think, this is really interesting. I wondered what it was, and what it was doing there. It's a bit smaller towards the end of the dream, but still large enough. As long as two elephants but not quite as high, a medium shade of solid brown.",

I’m watching the instructors teach them. There is something missing in the instruction. The dances are sloppy - their lines aren't straight, they’re not finishing their movements, and it just doesn’t look good. The teachers are hard and harsh with their instruction. You can see on the faces of the kids that they don’t like it. So I’m hired as a strength and conditioning coach. I end up taking a different role where I invite the kids to a stage - sort of like an opera house. It’s all wood and they’re ice skating on the wood. I don’t know how this is possible. However, I invite them, “Hey, come work out with me. We’re going to make you guys stronger. Why don’t you guys show me your dances so I can see.” As I’m watching, I realize they aren’t in it. They don’t have 100% commitment to the dance they’re putting on, to the movements they’re making. They are just sort of half-assing everything. So I’m giving them a pep talk: “You guys have to commit to making this dance happen. You have to commit to be in the spot you’re in so the line is straight. Or you have to extend your leg and your arm. You have to really go for that jump. Give it as much as you’ve got.” While I’m giving this talk, they’re nodding at me and smiling. You can feel the energy shift. Now they’re motivated to do it. They go back out to dance and they’re doing much better. I have this feeling that the other instructors are pissed off at me for doing that, like I had stepped out of my role and my position and overstepped their boundaries. Part of me is like, “You should have told them that.” The other part of me is like, “Oh gosh, now I might not have a job.” So I’m in a very interesting place, kind of like fuck you and fuck it.

The hall is big enough that it doesn’t feel crowded. There’s a certain amount of space between people. In fact, we are sitting at our own table. The table is bigger. There are lots of empty chairs. No one else is supposed to be sitting there. There are only three place settings - mine, my daughter’s and her guest. I’ve taken some time to do my hair before I go out. I’m wearing a silver tiara. It’s not fancy, it just wraps like a headband made of malleable silver wire. I’m using it to keep the hair from falling in front of my eyes if I tilt my head forward. I also have a multi-strand silver bracelet on my left wrist with tiny stones in it - they are opalesce in appearance. I’m wearing a light blue dress and it feels really good on my body. We’re having a conversation at the table. I excuse myself for a moment to use the restroom. On my way to the hall, this man comes up behind me. He’s fairly boisterous. I don't turn around to look at him. He’s trying to exert himself into my consciousness. I don’t want to talk to him. After I come out of the restroom, I see him again. He’s sitting at a table with some other people. Again, he’s boisterous and loud, so he’s distracting. When i return to the table with my daughter and her boyfriend, he comes to sit with us. He’s trying to sell all of us on this idea that he makes some kind of chart that explores people’s personalities and lends them insights into themselves. I listen to him for a few minutes then decline his services. However, he leaves his business card. I’m surprised that it’s located in Lindsay, a town I’m familiar with and know that I’m going to be visiting some time in the future.

It’s super dramatic with tall cliffs and ocean waves hitting the edge of the cliffs. Everything is dark - the ocean and the sky. I don’t know if it’s dark because it’s stormy and cloudy or because it’s night time. The inhabitants of the castle, myself included, are all pegasuses - horses with wings. They kind of remind me of the cartoon from my childhood, “My Little Pony,’ but it’s not light and joyful like that cartoon. It’s definitely darker, not sinister, just dark. There’s a couple of us flying pegasus horses. We are friends and we all have our own magical powers. We have things to do and are coming and going. It’s clear that I have a journey to take. I need to go somewhere and fly through the sky. The first part of this journey is me looking for another pegasus sister. She has gone down into the ocean to find something. I realize I need to do the same thing. There’s a greenish blue orb of light that is way, way deep below the waves and that’s where I need to go. I’m flying over the ocean waves looking for this sister and for my way in. Finally I dive into the water. It’s not cold and I can breathe under the water. It seems pretty normal. I’m swimming/flying through the water going really deep to find this blueish green light. I do eventually get to it. It takes a long, long time. I know there is something waiting for me and I don’t remember what it is when I wake up. Whatever the information is, I receive it and I come back up out of the ocean. I’m not supposed to go back to the castle. I know I am to continue this journey. So now I’m flying over the ocean. The dark has gone.

I’m going to give you a ride.” I’m like, “I don’t need a ride anywhere.” He says, “No, I’m going to drive you someplace.” Part of me is like, “Fuck no, I don’t want to get in a car with you.” The other part of me is like, “Oh okay, I guess we’ll see where we’re going with this.” I hop in and we’re driving around. He starts telling me about his kids. We had a conversation at the grocery store about his children. I had watched him while I was at the grocery store.

We knew we had to leave because there was a new owner that came and we couldn’t stay. So we left and we went running through the woods and I lost the other person. I had to jump all these fences like one after another after another but they were set up really close to one another, so I would jump one and literally the next fence would be one foot after it. Then there are these artificial lights and I came across the stadium and the security guards were outside and I started jogging like it was my plan to jog there the whole time and look for this high school. I went inside and met this class that was gathered inside talking about their plans for graduation. Somebody said that they were accepted to medical school, somebody else was talking about something that they learned about themselves...like an introduction and it was artificial lighting like in the science lab and for some reason it was a high school. I told everybody, “I’ll see you at the University of Connecticut,” and I was telling them that I went there for high school. We played against them and always lost and I was coming there to find a job. I don’t think I was me in this dream.",

    "text": "“The Chandelier” This dream begins in some kind of building. I’m there because I’m teaching a teacher training, but it’s really different. The training is to help people connect to and expand their senses so that they have an expanded experience in their daily lives. I’m really enjoying using plants, food and light in the training. I’m fascinated by the process, actually. I teach every other weekend. On this particular weekend in May, May 23, I’m not supposed to be teaching. However, I have been borrowing things to use as equipment and examples - just gathering and borrowing rather than buying things to use in the teaching. This one friend of mine, Thomas has contributed something I can use in the training. He’s dropping it off athte facility where I teach as opposed to bringing it to my house. So I have to go in on my day off to meet him there. I am surprised that the doors are open and there seems to be another school going on. I’m just a little surprised because I was expecting it to be empty. But there’s another training of some sort involving children in one room and this is the room where I normally do my training. So I wait until there’s a little bit of a break and I wave to the person who is facilitating. I say, “I’m really sorry to bother you. Is it okay if I just go over here and leave some stuff in the cupboard?” She says, “Yes, that’s no problem. You can join in if you want to.” I tell her, “No thank you. It’s my day off. I just want to quickly drop this off and then I’ll be on my way.” But Thomas is not there yet. So I end up sitting off to the side and watch what she’s teaching. I think, “Wow, that's a really different approach. I love the outside the box way she’s teaching the same old thing to these students.” I feel this curiosity for and respect for her teaching method. My friend arrives. He’s got a big cardboard box in his arms and says, “I need to assemble this.” I say, “Okay, well, let’s go into one of the empty rooms so we’re not bothering anyo (...)",

A a part of the gym or the building in general, unbelievably grotty old bare wood, urine soaked, stinking, filthy stalls or rooms or something that had a basement feel. They're all vacant now, but had been used by students during the school year, I had no idea how. Almost a concentration camp feel. Paul Thompson is there, and an adult female, staff person. We needed to prepare something. It's the afternoon of the last day. Still had to, I say something about my teacher, who I inadvertently call Mrs. Pavelko, then catch myself and say, she was my high school history teacher. [true] Then I say some other name I don't remember. We had to make some kind of presentation. I wasn't looking forward to it. I just wanted to be out of there. I'd gotten a loaf of very thinly sliced, like challah, but it was a lighter color and had a harder crust. It was in a cupboard that was mine that was adjacent to the hideously grotty area. This woman and Paul and I go down through this unbelievably squalid and awful, stinking area. There's an area of water that looks very dodgy, and it is penned up in this one area by boards to form the grotty area. The water is fairly clear, though, not cloudy. I make some remark to Paul, did he find any geniuses, (?) and he says no. The water is blocking our way out. Paul jumps in, up to his neck, fully clothed. I don't want to. I'm thinking I'll catch cold, and who knows what is in that water, from toxins and microbes to larger creatures. Turns out there's a way around the water, across some dirt, and up a small rise of more dirt, to the road, a two-way paved asphalt road in good condition, painted stripes and all.",

A large lecture hall, no risers, all on one level, woman instructor. Possibly life sciences related. The room had a fairly high ceiling and tall windows through which sunlight streamed, giving it an airy feeling, It was quite full of students and equipment, though. I never make it to the next class let alone the one after that, and I ask myself whether I'm up to doing this — whether I really want to. I've talked Mom into paying for it, and it would be heinous to abandon it on the first day, and yet I was feeling overwhelmed and didn't think I was up to it. A second day? I've forgotten a bunch of stuff and don't even know where the second class is. I make it back to the first one. Lots of details. I had a little locker. There were communal lockers, but I had a little metal box that fit inside the larger locker. At one point I'm sitting on the grass right next to fifteenth, about at 43rd, not quite as in reality. A lot of people on the street. Across the street I see a varied lineup of people waiting to cross. A young Hasid, and a very mixed group of other types. I'm with a few other people, friend I assume, smoking a big joint. I think well, it's legal now, but I was dubious as to whether it was okay to sit and smoke in public like that, never mind the wisdom of it.

It starts off and I’m actually unclear on whether I am the first group of kids’ actual mother or if I’m their stepmom, but I’ve been with them for some time. There’s three boys and a girl. We do live alone. There’s no man in the house. The boys are all teenagers and they’re very close in age, like 17, 16 and 15. The girl is a little bit younger, but also a teenager, perhaps 12 or 13. They’re all in various stages of self-sufficiency and they are aware that we need to be moving soon as I am. Then the scene switches a little bit and I’m at another house. The house is actually quite spectacular. It’s a farmhouse style that has had a lot of work done to modernize it and continue to hold its beauty. It’s not in a town, but there are a few other houses around. It feels like some other people have also chosen not to live in an urban setting and are perhaps because of their own independence, wanting to live off the land and make similar choices, they may be in the early stages of a rural community. But I don’t feel that it’s happened quite yet. You can just see that there are other landowners around. The house has a big wide decking around it so you can stand on it before entering. It also feels like it adds to the safety and the way the house is heated and cooled by night and day through this deck and the roof. It’s like a wide, deep and covered porch. The roof is tiled. The kitchen is interesting, too. There’s a fireplace in the very center. There’s a big big wide beam that splits the kitchen in half at the ceiling. The table is built to hug the fireplace and wrap around it in a C-shape. I also notice the water tank attached to the fireplace. I haven’t quite figured out how it heats the water in the kitchen, but it does. The dream begins with me. I’m at the table. There are four girls and one boy. The boy is the oldest, probably 11 or 12. The youngest girl is still a baby, maybe 1, possibly (...)",

We're looking a the ocean, and the water's disturbed. Already some larger than normal waves, and the water is beginning to recede. Some people are walking out onto the beach, and I'm saying, we have to get the hell out of here. Where we are standing will soon be covered by at last 20-30 feet of rapidly moving water. No one will survive it. We drive about 30 miles inland to a funky cabin or old house that is shut up most of the time, where we stay for days, if not longer. I've gotten out with just the clothes on my back. I had had a suitcase and other things and abandoned it all in the haste to leave. Forgotten episodes. We go back to the coast, finally. There had indeed been a tsunami. The geography is changed. A lot of dead trees, now ghostly grey. The coast line was fairly flat in this area. The last bit, I'm looking for my wallet. A guy there, a fairly young man, a person of some importance, possibly a bit shady. He helps me look for my wallet. He had a bunch of stuff organized, and there were various people there. We find two wallets, but neither is mine. They are black leather like mine but too large and would never fit in my pocket.",

He’s responsible for bringing joy to children, but it looks like my ex and not Santa Claus. We’re in a house and all around the house is white tundra, so North Pole’ish. It starts out as a gigantic mansion. I’m me, but I don’t think I’m female. It’s like we’re two friends. This guy has a role - an important job. It almost feels like I’m freeloading because there isn’t anything I’m doing. He points it out, “You don’t even have a job. You don’t even have a purpose, really.” I’m like, “Ooh, that feels gross. I need to go find my purpose.” Then it shifts from this gigantic mansion place that is super opulent with gold, wall sconces, chandeliers, and gigantic floor to ceiling windows that are at least two stories tall. I think I’m standing on this huge staircase at some point. Then the mansion shrinks down to this smaller house. Now it is my ex and me. I don’t know that I’m female yet. I think I’m still his friend - I’m a dude. There are a bunch of kids that he’s supposed to be caretaking or bringing the light to. I think they’re maybe ours. The vibe between the two of us is weird. He’s definitely holding the power over me. But I’m like, “You’re supposed to be caretaking these kids and I’m actually doing all the work here. You’re not fulfilling your role.” So he says to me, “Well let’s talk and work this out.” So while we’re trying to talk, we’re also doing - we’re moving through different rooms in the house, cleaning or packing to go on a trip. We’re packing things in one room of the house. Then we’re moving to the kitchen and I’m packing up food and he is doing stuff. The kids are following us around the house observing what’s going on. Also we give them small chores to do as we move through rooms in the house. At some point I’m like, “When are you going to stop and hug the children? Wh (...)",

One end looks out onto my grandmother’s rock garden and the other end looks out across a meadow and down towards the next house, which is quite a ways away. It’s a big picture window. My grandfather always had a desk there with a blotter on top of it. In my dream, instead of a blotter, there's a big square shallow box the size of the blotter, maybe only an inch deep. Inside of it is a whole bunch of compartments, about the size of business cards. There must be 60 of these little compartments. Some have business cards in them. Other ones have tiny notepaper. On one is written a name and a phone number. It says, “Herod” and a phone number. Suddenly I see my dad writing the number down. But there’s no phone on the desk. Then my dad is gone again and I’m just looking at this myriad number of business cards. They are all of different designs and I’m looking at the colors and the designs. Then I realize it’s time to go. My dad and Uncle Kevin are there. I go downstairs into the kitchen. My dad is putting my Uncle Kevin’s bicycle in the back of the car. He’s driving him. Suddenly, we are in the city, in Toronto. My dad and my uncle are in the car. But I'm riding my Uncle Kevin’s bicycle. It’s a little bit too big for me. So when I am forced to stop at red lights, I have to put one foot on the ground and tip the bike over because the seat is so high that my feet don’t touch the pedals and I have to put them on the ground. I’m trying to follow them, but they go through the light and I get stuck at the red light. I go for two blocks. Then I don't want to keep doing this. So I just let them go and I decide to go back to where we came from. So I turn the bicycle around in the street. It’s really busy. There’s a lot of traffic and cars parked on either side.

I'm hoping the friendship will deepen and that this will turn into something. The whole group is really not mainstream. We're in this theatre and it's some kind of R rated movie. There are two children with this group. We leave the theatre in a hurry because one of the group, may have been my wife, who either asked for or made an inquiry to the movie staff... we didn't want to get thrown out or cited for being in this R rated movie with children, so we leave precipitously. Something about babysitting these children. I'm telling someone whose business it was to know, that the kids were great and the babysitting had gone very smoothly, but it's all BS. As I'm saying this I don't know where the kids are. I'm climbing some stairs, railing to the right. Very old, very odd construction. Outside, stone or brick, the risers maybe concrete. Maybe two feet wide. Rises very steeply to a brick doorway, but just a doorway, no building behind it. To the left, I'm afraid to look. It drops off and I'm afraid it is a very long ways down, so I deliberately don't look. I just want to get to the top and through this door. It turns into a long trek down a very long beach. We are running towards or away from something. Think towards. The beach is sun-blasted, a desert behind it, a bluff, not real high, maybe 100 feet, a steep but not vertical slope. No vegetation on the bluff. Surf, and very bright sun, totally clear sky, wind off the water. We walk for miles down the beach. Our group gets strung out and partially separated.

So I turn around and to walk back to the house I had left. I'm cold, though my legs are not freezing, and I wonder how much longer I can take it.

I'm trying to remember when they were my students, and I conclude that it wasn't in public school, but from the one year I taught Hebrew School.

My finger was there from last year and I thought to myself that it was too late to reattach it. The parade came and my friend Emily came out of the window across the street all dressed up in an old school dress, dancing and having fun with two other women. They were having fun and yet on our side we were cramped in this van. The parade was a funeral and a big brass band was playing and the song was my favorite cover for a brass band (in real life) and also my mom’s favorite (she’s passed but she loved Allison Krauss version). The song is “I’ll fly away.” Suddenly I realized we were at a funeral and the second line was coming. I went to go get something from the back - I think it was something to write with - and lost my space at the front where I could see. I wanted to get out but the finger and cigarette butts were on the ground (I do not smoke in real life). It was dark and swampy, not day or night. It was later and I was in New York and there were flashing signs and grey gravel streets and I was with someone, a younger black man who had short braids in his hair, he was medium build and we were looking for someone at a scene.

But two or three of my siblings are not there. We can’t find them. I’m starting to get stressed because they haven’t met us where we’re supposed to all be. The communication between my parents and siblings is shit. No one is telling anyone what they need to know. Part of it is we either don’t have our cell phones or don’t have service. There’s an actual physical communication breakdown, but also distance. Some siblings wander off and miss the tram they’re supposed to be on and don’t show up where they’re supposed to go. I get two or three of my siblings and we show up where we’re supposed to go, but then we realize we’re in the wrong spot or the gate has been moved. We have to get back on another tram and go back to where we had come from, or so I think. We go and we do it. My parents and my grandma finally get a hold of us and are like, “No, you could have stayed where you were at. Now it’s going to take you longer to get where you’re going and you’re possibly going to miss this plane or tram.” I’m not sure which - plane or tram. There is a lot of back and forth, not going to the right place, not finding each other, not communicating well. We realize we are retracing steps we didn’t need to retrace. We didn’t have to go back to the place we went back to. It would have been better if we stayed where we were, or even better, moved forward.

Diane offers to buy our tickets. I think it’s so nice of her. I then wonder what we’re going to do about our sleeping situation. We didn’t bring sleeping pads or blankets, so we’ll be sleeping in the car through the cold night and just throwing clothes over us. Now I think we might be able to afford a night or so in the hotel because Diane bought our tickets. We are walking through the festival. It’s more like a regular festival with vendors rather than Burning Man’s creative form of energy exchange and generous artistic sharing. As we continue to walk, we end up on a concrete street with hotels and office buildings. My husband looks up into a window and it’s cracked by a bullet hole.

Out of all of us, I’m the actual hula dancer.” They are like, “Well, because you dance hula, you’ll be able to pick it up. But we’re going on stage now.” I’m like, “Eh, right.” I say, “I don’t have the costume. Can you at least dance it for me at least once?” They find lei for me and costume for me. Interestingly enough, the costume is a bleached white pareo on the bottom. I don’t know what we have on top - I think nothing, just lei and lei on our head and kupe’e on our wrist and feet. I keep saying, “Can you show me the dance? Where in the lineup do I need to be for all of this?” We’re heading out onto the stage. The stage has maybe two inches of water on it and water all around it. The audience is on the other side of the water. We’re going to be dancing in the water. But I still don’t know the dance all the way, and none of my classmates are forthcoming. I get the sense that they’re bummed that I showed up and they were going to do the dance without me. They didn’t want me there. The reason they didn’t teach it to me is that they didn’t want me there upstaging them. This is such a strange thing in my mind. I don’t understand in my mind why as a class we’re presenting this hula to everyone and they’re trying to keep me out of it. Then the dream shifts to me being an observer.

There are a lot of people on their mats and ready for class. But it’s not very organized. I start to teach even though I don’t know who they are or where we are or what I’m going to teach. There are also people in the back of the studio in private massage rooms. One person is the studio owner and it’s just so odd. So I’m trying to teach and put the students in poses so they aren’t looking forward at me, so I can put on a t-shirt and my bra. I keep messing up with the bra over the shirt or sleeves and everything is just a mess. I’m trying to teach a lunge with breath of fire, but I can’t get the directions clear without demonstrating. I try to explain it over and over again and it’s so frustrating for everyone. Finally I get my shirt on and I demonstrate and instruct at the same time. They get it at last, but it doesn’t seem worth the effort. I continue with the sequence. I walk to the back and someone points out to me that the water heater is leaking into the walls and there is a huge red stain on the wall. It’s coming from the massage room where the yoga studio owner is practicing behind the curtain. I continue teaching while I’m investigating the mess and my mind is split. The yoga studio owner is under the sheets and undressed, but still taking my class. I decide I can’t continue this investigation while I am also teaching. So I go up to the front and think I need to teach. I see that there is a student up front preparing to teach a sequence from her notebook. She sees me and says that I can continue. I look at her notebook and see that she has written and doodled a pretty advanced and creative sequence. I realize these students are more advanced and I was teaching a very basic class. I tell her I’ll bring them to a certain pose, then hand the class over to her to complete. I bring them all into  (...)",

I forgot that sometimes I dream about him but it’s been awhile. He was silent most of the time. I showed up with a group of people - a woman and an older woman who was like her mother or grandmother of Asian descent and then another younger woman. I can’t remember if I know her in real life. I really had to use the bathroom and there was this joke that every time I had to use the bathroom the older woman would cut me off but I didn’t have to use the bathroom when I woke up in real life I went back to sleep and I continued to dream. I dreamed I walked into a bathroom and I looked in the mirror and I was wearing three sports bras. It looks like they were on backwards almost but I checked and they weren’t, they were just really high on my chest and I want to try to use the toilet but it was a strange strange toilet and looks like a tub filled with water and I didn’t want to pee in that and so I thought maybe I should wait. Then William came in and I asked him and he said that I could use the toilet in the other room. He pulled back a door and there was an old-school old-fashioned regular toilet and I realized I was in a future, but I was also in the past. We planned to hook up later. We went to into the water together. It was like a soaking tub and so nice.",

The seed expands. It happens very quickly. It expands into a baby. The baby stays a baby for perhaps a couple of days, whereas the seed grew into a baby in a couple of minutes. Over the course of the days that it’s a baby, I notice that it has a fondness for food that is different than people normally give babies. My relatives and in particular, my sister-in-law try to give the baby things they would have given to their own babies. I keep telling them, “No, he doesn't like that kind of food.” They’re not forcing him to eat food, they just keep offering him this regular baby food. He keeps refusing it. I put the baby into a bed that I’ve made and swaddle him with what I’ve got around to wrap him in. The next day he is a boy. It’s the same thing with the nourishment where my relatives and in particular my sister-in-law offer him what they think a boy should eat. He doesn’t eat it. But I’m giving him some different kind of food and I don’t know what it is. It’s not even really food. It’s not plants. It’s just something I intuitively know he would like, but the rest of my family is not noticing or not recognizing that it’s food. But it does nourish him and he grows really quickly. I put him to bed that night as a boy. Before he even goes to sleep, I watch him change into a man. I can clearly see his features. His face grows into something that is a bit angular in terms of jaw and chin and nose. He has brown hair, brown eyes, brown eyebrows. He’s quite tall and thin. Other than looking somewhat elfish of face, he doesn’t look strange. Anyone would think he is human and no one would know that he’s really grown out of a petri dish. So he’s no longer content to stay in the house. He leaves. He just goes out the door. There’s a regular day in my home. I’m not leaving the home. I’m making someth (...)",

I'm not observing her, or doing anything formal, just there. There are rows of tables and benches, not individual seats. I sit towards the front on the far right side, no one to the right of me. It's a silent reading or working period. I have a number of items that I just can't quite seem to manage. For some reason I took some things out of a bag and spread them on the table, and then I couldn't keep track of what was there and what wasn't. Rounding them up to put them back in the bag was impossible. At one point this male student, who was a real student that I had once had, Bill S., whom I rather enjoyed, comes and helps me do something. There was a student in the row in front of me to the right, I was in the second to the front row, who was about to be disruptive. At first I thought he was having some kind of crisis. Bill's over there, and another student. They help him move this very long musical instrument, a stringed instrument, but unlike any in waking reality. Then I'm in the back of the room where there's an office. A door to it, and a large glass window between this office and the classroom. I don't go in there, but there's a keyboard and mouse outside the room that I'm able to use, that connect to a computer inside of it. I begin to write something, forget what. When it gets to be near the end of class, it's a windows machine, and I can't figure out how to close the program, or even just close the window that had my writing in it. The window that my writing was in, which almost filled the screen, had a couple little boxes in the upper left, and I can't read their labels. One of them may have said quit or stop. So I just leave it, because what I had written wasn't sensitive. But when I look back, the window had closed and the monitor was much smaller and dark.

At the top is, I paddle my kayak up the hill? I'm at the top, I'm in it, and there's an artificial pool that gets shallower, until it's just a few inches deep. The bottom and sides are painted blue, like a swimming pool. At the top is a kiddie pool with a few little kids splashing around in it, and I'm there in my kayak. I need to get a boat license for my kayak. I had looked it up, and there's supposed to be some place up there with the word marine as the final word of the title, where you can get them and other licenses. I pick up my kayak and go inside this building, a very modern office-park type thing. But inside I can't find any such place. There are other buildings and offices nearby, though the one I went into was the most obvious one. That's where the waterway led to. As I'm walking around inside, they're about the start shooting a commercial, and I feel very much in the way. I explain to somebody there what I want. He can't think of any place. There's a law office that deals with maritime law, and marine is part of the title, but it's not the place to get the license. I realize I don't have my wallet on me. So even if I had found the correct office, it wold not have helped, as I had no ID or way to pay for the license. Outside, I talk to a woman, she's sixtyish, pleasant, we're looking around at a few of the buildings in the area. She remarks that she finds one of them particularly pleasing. To me it's nondescript.

I find another, similar building more interesting, with clinker brick, and also the white or cream stone trim, and nice details.

There is wainscotting on the walls and crown molding. It has that lovely creaking sound everywhere where your feet walk. The house creaks. The doors creak. When you walk up and down the stairs, the stairs creak. It’s also built in a square. So, the stairs would go up one side of the house and down the other side, so that there can be a wood stove or something in the middle that heats the upper floor bedrooms at night when people are sleeping or even when the weather is cold. My room is on the second floor. One wall would be the windows looking to the outside, and opposite that would be the door that goes into the hallway. The hallway has a banister on one side that goes around in a square around the middle. So the hallway is actually quite a long tall domed ceiling and then the side that has the doors into everybody’s bedrooms. It feels like a square. There are at least two bedrooms on each side, so that makes it an eight bedroom house upstairs. It feels really, really big and I think it’s even bigger than that. There’s more than one bathroom. The fact that I have my own ensuite, my bedroom is also really big. This is my dream setting. I am in my bedroom and I’m aware that my daughter and her boyfriend have gone into my own ensuite bathroom because I can hear their voices. It sounds like one of them is in the shower and the other is just doing something in the bathroom. So they’re having a conversation. I realize it’s my daughter in the shower.

It got very creepy and scary, but then it was all ok somehow, some kind of reconciliation. And before that an episode in a theater. Three young men were in the control booth. The theater was not in use at the time. They were playing music or something, and it was coming out on the theater speakers and even on the screen. It was overriding what I was doing.

A number of very old suitcases and trunks. Unfortunately they are empty. There was an opening in the ceiling, the roof, a hatch with mechanism that was still operable, that you could open and load things in or out. There was a hint that I had been used for nefarious purposes by a previous occupant, who may have been an ancestor of mine, and who may have dealt in stolen good -- just an intimation, nothing clear or specific. The house was at least 100 years old. There was a cabinet (?) some built-in storage, that was full of spools of golden ribbons of various kinds. One was a gold or brass chain. There were also some shelves of books, right children's books, not dusty old tomes. I didn't investigate them. The lead-in to this section of the dream was that I was sitting at the top of some stairs, a bare wooden floor, and a lot of little nails and staple-gun staples or various sizes and weights in little piles on the floor.

I’m there with my daughter. In order to participate in the carnival, we are required when we enter to put on some kind of costume. I feel in my being that I don’t really want to because I know they aren’t washed in between wearers. I feel that they have the potential of having bugs in them. This has partially due to the fact that they’re sitting on bales of hay. But this is something she’s really been looking forward to. So I hesitantly and gingerly put on my costume which is some kind of navy blue skirt, navy blue overcoat that’s belted, and a hat. There are shoes that go with it, but they hurt my feet. So I’ve taken off the shoes and am carrying them. It has a little of the 1930s to the design of the clothing. She dawns her, as well. They’re very large for her - the sleeves are too long. She’s a young girl. I roll up the sleeves and adjust her hat so it’s not flopping over her eyes. We go through the first pseudo-activity. We’re climbing over hay bales. The thing moves us upwards. At the top of it, there’s a door. It brings us into something we’re going to see as opposed to experience or climb. We’re waiting in line to go in and the attendant asks me why I don’t have the shoes on because I’m supposed to be wearing them. I explain that they hurt my feet - they’re too small and they pinch my toes. She gives me a dirty look, but doesn’t make me put the shoes on. I’m also offended by some kind of connotation that the costumes represent either a religion or an ethnicity. So because she’s glaring at me, I also retort, “Would I have to wear the same costume if I was pretending to be Christian.” I think I said Christian, but I can’t really remember. Her response to that is a different kind of look. She stopped glaring at me and looks a little taken aback. But she’s moved back and I think, “W (...)",

Somehow nothing that happened really stuck though, so even if we died we would be fine. We all entered a giant tent at the start of the round where we looked for weapons. Most of the weapons were letter-opener swords. I grabbed one and went on the offensive. I found Erica and tricked her so that I could stab her. I saw the red blood pouring out where I had inflicted the wound. I did the same to Doug. I managed to win the first two rounds, but needed to win the third in order to secure complete victory.  In the third round, I failed to find a weapon and only was able to find a walking sticks to use as make-shift weapons. Instead of hunting down other players, I went to the main temple area and persuaded an official to help me. Once we got inside of the temple, I realized that the final round was a cook off and I had to prepare a meal for the judges. The meal was spaghetti, but we had to make it with three different kinds of sauces. I had one red sauce and a white sauce, but I needed a second red sauce which I didn't have. I used some plain alfredo sauce in the hopes that the judges wouldn't notice.  But then we realized that this wasn't the real challenge! The real challenge was to steal 200 gold pieces worth of items from the temple. As we were searching for items, a team of thieves showed up and were going to try to steal from us. But we were one step ahead. I made a plan with my brother to give them a tour of the temple while Doug would stay behind and steal their wallets.",

We have come up with a new drug that doesn’t have a name yet. It’s like a combination of Molly and something else. There is a very artistic creative guy dancing and frolicking around. He comes outside and he takes a piece of paper that he’s drawn and written on, and he posts it high on a tree. He’s tall and he can reach this high. Someone gets it down and reads the paper. They say, “Oh my gosh, this is the name of the drug. It’s Meggy. It’s a combination of Molly and Peggy.” The party dissipates a bit. I go home with my husband. We go upstairs. This is not a home I recognize from waking life. We decide to take our dose of Meggy. We know it takes a while to begin. We wander around. I get a book and start to read. I notice my vision starting to change - my right eye that in waking life is already damaged, starts to get really puffy and slotty so I can’t see well, and my other eye starts to change as well. I feel like it’s starting to set in. Someone comes and knocks on the door. We let him in and he says, “We’ve gotta go.” So we all get in the car. There are cars filling up with other people. I see a blue car that was earlier in the day quite nice, but now it’s beat up a bit and covered in mud. We’re all trying really hard to get out fast, so something is going on. We arrive at a rundown hotel. One of the girls steps in and she’s trying to talk to the concierge. I’m watching her from a different perspective - as if from behind the concierge’s head. I’m looking her up and down. She’s dressed as a very prim and proper lady, all in white with white pumps. But she has dark black circles under her eyes and she’s really pale. She doesn’t look quite right. All of us have taken Meggy. Then there is violence. The woman transforms into a wild animal and kills him. The guy in charge of the whole (...)",

There are other classmates with me, but I’m not sure which ones. They’re all getting ready for a party and I’m trying to get ready with them. The house we’re in is dark. There was a felt sense of unease. My brother shows up, too. We are fighting and arguing. I’m not sure what we’re fighting about, but there’s definitely discord. All I can remember of this part of the dream is that I’m trying to get ready. They’re all ready to go and are leaving. I’m trying to find shoes to put on. I’m trying to find an entire outfit - I don’t know what to wear and don’t have anything that feels good. Part of it is my resistance to going to this party. It’s making it hard for me to decide on an outfit and shoes. A coworker of mine is here, too - he’s my date to this party. Of all the other characters, he’s the only one I feel comfortable with. He’s encouraging me in a sweet way to get dressed and get in the car with him. I do. There’s a party of the dream where I’m in the car with him and we are going somewhere. That feels nice and my body feels calm in that place. But there’s so much agitation beforehand when I’m trying to get dressed, and there is bickering between me and my friends and me and my brother. My coworker is trying to smooth everything out, help me get ready and take me to the party. I go from being in the house in the living room area with friends to being in his Jeep or truck. I have feelings of gratitude and safety while I'm in the car with him. Then the scene changes. I am outdoors near the ocean. There’s a covered pavilion area and a bunch of people dancing hula. It’s so lovely to watch them dancing. It’s a bunch of different haul halaus dancing, so they each have their own style and their own songs. It’s not super formal because there isn’t a stage. I’m standing watching them to my right and behind me. They have their (...)",

I said I'd buy him lunch or whatever, deluxe cheeseburger, etc. He wants to know where it is. I said, I haven't bought it yet. I waited for you to come back. Then he wants something else, which is fine. We're standing at a bar. The guy behind the bar is training someone as he goes, and he's making up what look like a lot of brown beans. It looks a little like baked beans, but there's lime sauce or juice in it, and chopped cabbage, perhaps. He serves it up to Scott on a flimsy paper plate. Scott eats it rapidly, then seems a little distressed, a little bloated, and I look away. We're walking along now and we're talking, when suddenly I realize that the person I'm talking to isn't Scott. It's somebody else. It was someone I knew, I think. I don't see Scott again. He's just disappeared. Earlier, we'd gone into a big sporting goods store and he complained that the price of boards, I assumed he means snowboards, is sky-high. The economy's changed. I've bought a bicycle, pretty nice bike with deep cherry red, glossy frame. Anyways, Scott is gone, and I'm feeling uncertain and bereft. I'm walking in some town, fairly nondescript, up a gentle slope on a sidewalk, concrete curb, minor arterial. I think I'll call Scott. I take my phone out, but it turns out to be a small laptop computer that barely fits into my pocket. It folds over. I have no idea how to use it. There's some advertisement on the screen.

We are leaving booby traps behind us as we go. I think we are traveling down a set of tracks for an underground tram. We’re passing by rooms with two-way mirrors. We can see people in the rooms. I don’t know where we’re heading, except that we’re trying to get out of where we are. It’s dark. If there is any lightning, it’s fluorescent bulbs. These booby traps we’re leaving are made of whatever we can find and use our ingenuity to turn them into something. I don’t even know what they all do. We’re on the move. We’re all kind of dirty and grungy. It’s not that we’re running away, but rather making a break for freedom. There’s not a lot of fear, just that we need to get this, this and this done, so we can get out of here. Then the dream shifts into me and a pole instructor from the pole studio. I’ve been practicing pole moves that she’s given me at home, but something happens and I’m unable to practice for a while. I go to one of her classes. I’m watching. She’s standing in the middle with a pole and there are twelve poles around her on the outside. The poles are really wide - I can’t wrap my hands around them. Instead of being a solid pole, there are metal handles that stick out on the side and you’re supposed to grab onto these handles to do the moves. After taking a hiatus, I’m watching. The pole instructor is calling out moves and everyone does them together perfectly synchronized. All of these women in their pole clothes are doing this move called the butterfly. They’re all doing it together. I walk in and she tells me to do this because she knows I can do it. I haven’t touched a pole in weeks and don’t know if I have the strength. She gives me her center pole because all the other poles are taken. I get up and do the move, but it’s a struggle. I can tell my legs are bent when they (...)",

My son and I arrive at Sadie and Brian’s house and we’re supposed to be leaving from there to go to the airport, but we’ve got some time. Sadie is making food and putting it in takeout containers so we can eat in the car on the way to the airport. There are about 4 hours until we have to leave, though. My daughter enters the dream and sets the alarm clocks and then is gone again. My son decides to sleep. I decide it’s best to stay up, but I want to have a bath, so I do. I use the bathtub and take a long soak with bubbles and everything. When I come out, Sadie is still cutting up things and putting them in takeout containers. She’s made one for my son and I, as well. I think this is really nice of her; however, I wasn’t hungry and it’s the middle of the night. I was just going to wait and eat on the plane. Now I wish I had some fruit. What she’s putting in there is leftover cooked potatoes - she is slicing them up and then grabbing pieces of processed cheese - like the singles you would take the plastic off. She has a whole stack of these and she puts in the microwave. The four on the top and bottom melt and become liquified. I notice she’s done this in a bowl before she’s unwrapped them.

Some organization that I was part of or was advising, or maybe I was just there hanging out, was looking at renting a facility for its programming, whatever that was, by Greenlake. One place we looked at adjoined the park, so there was no street between it and the lake. This was a huge advantage. I was pointing out that they could use it for their 1880's skinny dipping party. A boathouse? We were looking at it on a map, and at the same time for real, from an elevated vantage point. I look over towards the lake, and it's been completely drained and scraped absolutely clean of all vegetation, except for Duck Island. The bottom is dry, freshly bulldozed dirt, orange-brown with fresh, parallel dozer tracks all over it. I'm not dismayed by this. It was part of a periodic cleansing process. It would be restored very soon. I was surprised at how shallow it was, and the lake was not as big as in reality. Then I'm walking and telling some guy, someone I'd just met, that I had dreamed so many dreams in that area, Green Lake itself and adjacent neighborhoods. My psyche seems to be based right here, I said. I wanted him to be more interested and even a bit impressed by this than he was. He didn't react much at all, or say anything. I'm sitting and looking around the neighborhood like I'm really there as I'm talking about this building they were considering renting, and they didn't much care for my idea of skinny dipping, unless the lease agreement specifically permitted it, as it would be taking advantage of the lessor. I thought, bleaugh. Looking at a very old wooden building deteriorated in one part. You could see into the structure. Nothing remarkable about it. I pause to consider what the area must have been like when that structure was new, much less built up than now. Some kind of gathering of area young people. White and black kids. Everybody's getting along fine. One seventeen year old, he's kind of cute. The gathering might have had something to (...)",

Somebody put that out to make the US look even worse than it actually is. In the dream the saying was clear and specific. We're walking and there's canals, but they are covered, hidden. You can see the old, concrete covers. He's telling me about them. He says the government favors keeping them. This is in a parklike area of low density and many large deciduous trees in leaf, but there were also streets with traffic cutting through.

My kids are still asleep in it. Then the dream backtracks - it’s like it freezes there - to the night before. I was in my room with my son and my daughter. We were playing some kind of game. The tools for it looked like markers, but they were actually magnetic. When you applied them to the board, which looked like a whiteboard, they left a colored line even though they were magnets and not markers filled with any kind of liquid color. They were not felt-tipped. The tips were really hard. As we were playing with them, it wasn’t just a free flow creative “let’s draw this.” There was some kind of instruction that went with the game. It was working out fine. We had to do an algebra or conning - which is how you navigate a boat using the chart of the water. So we were following the instructions, doing the equations, then putting dots on the whiteboard with these magnetic markers. I guess it was taking a long time because the magnetic pens started to disintegrate, but my kids kept playing the game - they kept doing the calculations. I was trying to fix the magnetic pens - the lids had popped off of some of them and were in the bottom of the container. Then it started getting more complicated. So instead of being a set of ten and they all looked like they were different colors, it was like there were three sets. They were all different shapes and the lids were all different sizes. One of the lids looked like it fit on one purple pen, but it didn’t, it actually fit on the other purple one. They wouldn’t leave the dots on the board unless the lids and the ends were on properly. And then the wires that were part of the internal workings started coming out of the ends and I was trying to reassemble them. This tired my children after a while and they both went to sleep.

It's after hours and mostly shut down, but there is still a little food service going on. I go into and through the cafeteria, and finally exit the building, wondering as I did so, why I had not just walked to the end end of the corridor and on out. When I get outside, I have no idea where I left my car. None at all. I'm looking for the same car as I have in reality, 2008 blue Chev Aveo. I seem to recall leaving the school twice. In one of them I go up on a bit of a rise behind the school and fly up and out over the school's roof, getting a fair bit of elevation and having a wide territorial view, but in no time I've descended into the school again, and find myself in some kind of art room. The roof was overall flat, but had hummocks all over it, perhaps four feet tall and in diameter, rounded tops, made of the same material as the flat portions of the roof, plaster or stucco. I find my way out again.... After a long time looking , I do find my car! But, instead of getting into it and driving away, I've got some little vehicle that can fly. The inventor is local. Some guy at the school or around it has invented a machine that can fly by means of thought power, and can float and fly and do all kinds of maneuvers. At first it's on the ground, and I go down some long suburban cul-de-sac, very flat, it's all flat there, big fir trees scattered about. The street is blacktop, lined with small apartment blocks and the odd house, but spread out, less developed than in reality. And there's another guy, vaguely south Asian, and he's in one of these machines too. We have a conversation, and he's quite pleasant. He's going to give me some tips -- we plan to talk again. There's some kind of after-school event. People are lining up for free dental work. I fly over them, and no one notices me, whi (...)",

I’m not so stoked about it because we are headed to the pole studio where I’m going to practice. I’m not sure if he was going to work out or practice. It is a pole studio/gym so there is a place for him to go workout. It’s important that he works out and trains because there’s something he’s training for. I am training, too. We get to the pole studio. Unlike the pole studio I practice at, which is light and bright, this studio is pretty dark. The poles are so tall that the tops disappear into darkness. It’s almost like the studio is as big as an amphitheatre. I have a nagging feeling. There are other people training, I don’t know who they are, but they’re all women. We get there and I realize this pole studio and workout facility is owned by Wendy. Wendy is a woman I had a crazy emotionally abusive relationship with and she is now an ex-friend of mine. Going to a place she owns is filling me with dread. The reason we were heading that way is because of quarantine, so she wasn’t there. She was also pregnant and out of the picture, so it was safe for me to go there. Now she’s no longer pregnant and quarantine is over and she shows up and starts being a total tyrant. She hasn’t seen me though, so I hide. I lay on the ground and the other women - some are younger, maybe 12 or so - all sit on top of me and do a dance. They’re like the goddess with lots of arms. They do one of those dances where each arm goes in succession. They’re sitting on me so you can’t see my body at all - I’m covered and hidden. Somehow Wendy sees me anyway. She makes them stand up and get off me so she can see me. She just starts yelling at me - “Get on the pole! Do the moves!” I can’t. I’m tired and I haven’t done pole in a long time, so I don’t have the strength I usually have. This is really hard and I’m feeling attacked without resources to defend myself, just out o (...)",

It's a big old high school building, but in the dream its Franklin Pierce High School, and Frank Melleins is the principal.

He's like, oh, yeah, like he'd forgotten about that, which also surprised me. Then I tell him that I never, at Palantino you get what's proper bakes into your bones, but I never actually read the whole thing. Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. I did look up specific things when I had questions. He seems to think that's all fine, and why am I telling him it? I go back to my classroom. Margaret and Adam show up. They're kids, both still going to the JDS. I think Margaret was. Adam definitely is. Adam had, it looked like a case for several LPs. You opened it like a book, and inside were places for half a dozen or eight compact disks. But I couldn't see any. Where are they? I asked him. It was some teaching thing with a lot of classical music, that looked fairly interesting. DVD for teaching, etc. He showed me they were inside this flap, so they didn't fall out. At one point a couple female teachers come in, and start rummaging around in my desk and looking around in my teacher's area. I ask them, can I help you? They're looking for a school to work manual, or somesuch. Well, it's not here, I say. This had been my classroom since the semester. They're polite and leave.

The snow is as tall as the car. I can see the car in front of us is having to make its own path through the snow. It’s interesting it’s making it because the snow is literally up to the top of the car. We are on our way to a shelter. We’re on an adventure. I’m not exactly sure who I’m with. We’re heading towards a hotel - it reminds me of an ice hotel in northern Europe. We make it there. There are multiple rooms, but it doesn’t actually look like a hotel. It looks like a huge cave and within the cave are rooms you can claim as yours. There were at least two people in the car in front of me and there are people in the car with me - I don’t know who or how many. We head into the hotel and get our rooms. The rooms are packed snow - the bed is snow shaped into a bed as you would shape a snowman. When you go out of the room and down the hall, there’s a huge crack in the ceiling where you can see blue sky. But when you look up, you can also see a cliff face that looks like the side of a mountain. The back part of the hotel is this huge cliff face. Something happens and I don’t know if somebody yells or a gunshot goes off or what, but there’s a moment with a really loud noise. As soon as that happens, I say, “Oh fuck!” I know that whatever that was, it’s a moment in a time when something acts as a catalyst and as soon as it happens, I can see an avalanche at the top of the cliff. The snow just starts coming down. There’s no fucking way any of us are getting out of the path. This hotel is full of people, including kids. I just know that we are all going to be buried by this avalanche. I had this hope in my heart that it stops or goes around us or somehow we get out in time. Now I’m booking it out the other way as fast as I can to get away from this avalanche. If I can just get in the car and get out and drive  (...)",

I show up at his home and go back towards his office. I don’t even make an appointment, I just show up. I am wearing a long green skirt and white top. I take off my top and turn around so he can look at my back. He doesn’t adjust it like I think he will. He presses a specific point or two like acupressure. He says, “That’s all you need. That will fix everything.” I’m like, “Mm I don’t know about that. I’m still hurting.” He says, “You’re good.

    "text": "I am in a house. I don’t recognize the house. My mother is there. She’s kind, which is strange because she’s not usually. We are washing dishes together at the sink. The sink has a bunch of windows that we’re looking out of and there are a bunch of indoor plants hanging. The plants are beautiful. One of them is totally cool and looks like green pearls that hang down. There are other leafy ones. That setting is quite beautiful. The energy and vibration coming from the plants is amazing and healing. But I don’t feel very comfortable talking to my mom - I feel like she wants something from me and I’m not wanting to give it to her. She wants kindness from me, I think. I do not want to give her any compassion and kindness. I’m faking it though and going through the motions. There’s another piece of the dream where I am holding my son as a toddler, he’s maybe 2 or 3. I’m just loving on him and he seems pretty content. I put him down to play. We’re hanging out next to each other and both of us are doing the parallel play that toddlers do. Then all of a sudden, in my mind, I go, “Oh my god, I’m an adult and yes, he’s content and happy where he is right there, but actually we need human connection.” I pick him up and his demeanor changes from very content and quiet toddler play to this absolute snuggly. His little body clings to me and he’s so much happier when I pick him up, love on him and include him instead of putting him down so he does his thing and I do my thing. It just dawns on me that I need to be holding him and carrying him. The connection between the two of us enlivens and blossoms and blooms. It’s so much better and deeper the second I pick him up and look at him in his face and eyes and he looks back at me. We’re connected and touching and present, really present with each other.",

I recognize my friends, Veronica, Gail and Irene. The man has the build of George Floyd. My friends seem to be representing the white women doing anti-racist work. There is another scene where I am leaving an AirBnB house with Veronica, Gail, Irene and my sister. We were on retreat discussing current events, racism and ant-racism. The ladies are getting in the car. I’m hanging around cleaning up the kitchen. The kitchen is a big mess and a woman arrives to help me clean. I’m putting dishes and foods away and making sure we bring home the dishes and foods that belong to us. My son is with the other ladies and they’re waiting for me. They say, “Come on, Viviane. We’re going to get back to the city really late and we’ve gotta go. It’s already after 3 and we won’t be home until after 9 now.” We were supposed to leave in the morning. I’m impressed with how the woman has cleaned the kitchen. I take my son’s hand and we go across the street and across the dirt medium. My friends tell me to watch out for the little dog. I see a mean looking old white man with big lumpy nose and bushy eyebrows. He owns this little yappy dog who has pooped all over the ground. He’s scowling at me and all of us for making noise and being here. My son and I are carefully walking over the dog poop. I see a 3 foot long rope-like piece of poop. We step over it to get in the car. The man continues to glare at us from behind his fence.",

I’m naked. He’s naked. Sex is going to happen. There are two other sex workers in the room with me - women - who are in his employ. I’m seeing the strangest view of the vulva and vagina. It’s like it’s mine, but I’m looking at it from the point of view of the lover. It’s weird and doesn’t look like what a vulva and vagina look like. It’s like a tube that actually looks like a hollowed out penis. It’s so strange. Then I go back into my body and I’m on my back. I can see my lover and he’s over me. He has a fork. He’s sticking the fork in my vagina which looks like this weird tube thing. The whole time I’m like, “Oh my god, that’s going to hurt! What is he doing with that?” This is maybe my lucid mind coming in because my dreaming mind is just going along with this dream. In the dream I’m like, “Yup, that’s what I want, let’s go for that.” Then I do this weird thing while I’m lying on my back - I cross my legs and watch my pelvis turn to the right, then my legs go into a splits. The two female sex workers grab my feet. Each of them have a fork and they’re scratching my skin with the fork. It’s like some very strange BDSM play. I’m like, “Yup, this is what I want. Go for it. It’s okay.” But the lucid part of me is like, “What the fuck? Why are you letting these people do that to you?” I’m observing this weird dynamic where I am simultaneously choosing it and in my power, but obviously just giving up my power for this thing that is super painful and I’m not enjoying at all. I’m literally getting forked. That ends at some point. I get off the bed and go to the two sex workers and say, “Here let me show you how to use your power now.” It’s as if everything that just happened there was me in my sovereign self, which I clearly wasn’t.

It’s a larger celebration with more people than normal. Many of them I don’t know. Because of this, her interactions with me are less frequent than they normally would be as she is running around greeting all the guests. I’m looking for someone I know. I’m reluctant to go into the house. I’ve arrived there with my son. He’s playing with some of the other kids of the people I don’t know. I have an eye on him. He’s about 4 or 5 years old in the dream. I know where he is and I can see he’s fine. I’m sitting on the grass enjoying the sun on my skin. I’m noticing the plants she has planted in her garden. I’m waiting for some of the people to greet her and settle somewhere, so we can have a conversation and I can give her the gift that I brought. However this doesn’t seem to be happening as there are a lot of people coming and going. So I decide to go for a walk. I look for my son. He’s not outside anymore. I ask someone if they’ve seen him. They say, “Yes, he went down that hallway.” They indicate with their finger which hallway. So I go down there, looking in the rooms with open doors. I realize that my friend’s husband is in the bathroom. I do not want to run into him. I’m hoping I’ll find my son soon. I see my son in a different bathroom across the hallway from the bathroom where her husband is in. My son is playing in the water. He’s taken off all his clothes. I ask him if he’ll get dressed and I tell him we’re going for a walk. He complies but is taking a really long time to do it. While he’s doing that, I exit the bathroom, continue walking down the hallway to the very last room and see my friend in there sitting and talking with a couple of women. She waves me over and I sit in a chair beside her. The conversation they started before I came into the room continues. It’s not about anything I care to converse about. It’ (...)",

They had adopted a young black boy and raised him. He is now an adult and is part of the wedding ceremony. I don’t know how this makes sense in terms of time. The matrix of time is mixed up. I’m standing at the front and people are gathered for the wedding. My mom is wearing a white gown. There are two young girls at the front with us, standing to my right. The ceremony begins and the younger girl is to do a reading. Everyone is looking at her expectantly. Instead of reading her paper, she puts it in a muddy puddle and smears mud all over the words so they are incomprehensible. We are all shocked and upset by her behavior. I try to rescue the paper and wash it in the water so she can read the words clearly. But she smears it with dirt again. I hold the paper up to the light to read the words, but I cannot read a thing. We have to put that paper down and change the plans. My mom gives me a collage that she made. It’s like a paper quilt of square images with lovely bright colors and quotes and cutouts of her in blue silky lingerie dresses - maybe pictures she had made for my dad. There are also two green magnets. She’s telling me how to read the collage for the ceremony. She moves the magnets around, so one magnet is at the beginning of the reading and the other shows where to stop reading. As we are looking, it sort of makes sense. I hold out the paper and begin, but as I’m reading, the collage changes size, the magnets move, the words turn into Spanish and others turn into Sunday morning type cartoons. I keep trying to read it, but it gets more and more convoluted. The people are just looking aghast at how unprofessional the ceremony is and how lost I appear in trying to read. After continuing to read and try time and time again, I end up giving up and folding the collage up.",

It’s like I have some kind of amnesia that’s just gradually coming back throughout the meal I can recall in the dream. The meal is situated in Ojai where I did all my yoga teacher training. Except it’s not at the Piazza. It’s at the Casita. I’m in a large kitchen. I’m sitting at the table by myself. I’m feeling like no one wants to talk to me and if I do speak, my voice won’t be heard. I feel invalidated. The food preparation which is normally shared is not even being shared this day. The food is brought in various containers, some of which appear to be styrofoam. I feel let down by that. I feel like the lack of community preparation and resorting to calling for takeout in a non-sustainable container is showing me that this is not what I’m here for. I was here for authentic community sharing. I feel duped that the community meal is actually a takeout. Now Lana is opening up all the containers and dividing each container pretty much evenly onto 16 plates. There are quite a few containers, probably 20. She looks mindless while she’s doing this and is doing it hurriedly with her hands. Once all the plates are ready, people just come and take one. They’re not even sitting at the table. They are taking their plate and going off to some other area by themselves. I don’t go. I notice that about 10 plates are gone. Then I get mine. I didn’t even realize people had started helping themselves. So I take one and sit down at the table. My teacher sits down beside me as though he’s expecting everyone to also be at the table because he sits down right beside me the way you would sit down at a table when you’re expecting it to be full.

The so-called memory is a decision to do a dream experiment with Pema of remote viewing where we both decide on an image or visiting each other in the dream world, then coming back together to compare notes. I’m playing the scene over and over again as a loop to see if it actually happened in waking life. Then there are checkpoints, sometimes I’m walking, sometimes I’m in the backseat of a car, and sometimes I’m on the back of a motorcycle. I’m going through these checkpoints where we are searched and allowed to pass through or are held for more thorough searching. At one checkpoint that looks like airport security, bags are being passed through a scanner. There is a big bag of ceremonial cacao powder going through the scanning machine. For some reason, they need me to look at it and claim it as my own, placing a paper on it to show that it is mine. I wasn’t carrying it with me. It was a delivery to me. I So I agree. I think I’ll take it with me right away. They tell me I have to leave it for two weeks and come back to get it. At another point, I climb onto the back of a motorcycle that already has two people on it. I’m holding an egg that is cracking. It’s precious to be holding the egg at this moment of time, but it’s also making me feel somewhat uneasy because I think the mother should be watching over the egg. The motorcycle is speeding down the highway. I show the egg to the person sitting in front of me. I pass the cracking egg into their hand. The inner transparent membranous layer is now showing and I can see the animal underneath trying to make its way out. The egg cracks open entirely and the animal emerges. It is a little slimy cute bird-rat. It has wings and a long tail that extends up the animal’s back like an external spine. It looks like a dinosaur or maybe a dragon. We are holding the animal with care as the motorcycle continues to speed on.",

The fur doesn’t look soft. It looks a little bit creepy but also a little bit cute. So now there’s this creature in the store and my son’s got him.

They were filing up the street angrily shouting and it was a street that looked like a suburban street. They were smashing the cars that were parallel parked, smashing the hoods of the cars, breaking all the glass in the windows, getting on top of the cars and smashing the roofs and just going up the street doing this. In the dream, I watch this, feeling helpless to stop. I can’t permeate the crowd. I have nothing to protect myself with. Then the crowd is gone - they continued up the street and are out of sight now. I’m standing while other people come out of hiding. They are commenting on the damage. Somebody says, “I know who the first two cars belong to. The first one belongs to the president of yoga and the second one belongs to the vice president.”",

We walk into what looks like a sound studio or stage where they film shows. The game is you answer a bunch of questions. You read or watch a little video clip and then you answer questions about it. My son is about 10 or 11 in the dream. I’m like, “Let’s go do this! It will be fun.” He’s kind of dubious. I’m also a little dubious. I’m looking at myself and my focus is on things like social justice and astrology, but we’re going to do this trivia type thing and it’s all shit I don’t know. The crowd is all white people who, for lack of a better term, look like white trash that watches Ricki Lake. This is my impression. Sure enough, all of the questions are about shit I know nothing about. In my perspective, these questions are really dumb. We’ve answered 5 or 6 questions and I’ve gotten all of them wrong or I haven’t answered them at all because I didn’t know the answer. I’m winning $0. The crowd is booing me and can’t believe I don’t know the answers to any of these things. I’m going like, “Well, this is shit I don’t care about, so of course I don’t know the answers.” All of this stuff is really important to them and the answers to the questions are really easy for them. I’m completely clueless. Their judgement and my judgement are super real. My son is looking at me like, “Mom, this is not fun.” I’m like, “Yeah, this is not fun at all.” I’m wanting to leave because I honestly don’t know any of the answers for any of this and it is not a comfortable situation being jeered at and teased and not winning any prizes.",

At the center of the city was this university and the head of the science department is also the mayor of the town. She does shady things - started changing pretty rapidly around town. Lots of restrictive rules were set in place. I was one of the land tenders and was working in the field. I just started noticing really weird things like huge holes in the ground covered with netting. I fell through the net and into the mud and it was pretty far down. There was a crawl space if you crawl through the mud, so the actual ground that we thought was the ground wasn’t. It was like a false layer of ground held up by a net in mud and dirt and then underneath that like a 2 foot crawl space between the net and the actual ground. I told somebody on the compound about it and they just replied: “The world is not as it seems,” and then they kind of entered into a trance. It seemed like their eyes glazed over and they just kept repeating that same thing: “The world is not as it seems,” and also other sorts of prophetic sayings. I got really freaked out and walked away and decided not to tell anybody else about the crawl space. Then this person became kind of like the town crazy person and stopped taking care of themselves. You could find them all the time leaning against or sitting against the wall of the main food court, kind of rocking back-and-forth like in prayer and repeating prophetic things - prophecies and such. I was taking a walk one day around the outside of the compound and I found this beautiful flower garden and I was wandering through it. I found a doorway into the lab which is also where the mayor and the head scientist of the lab worked. All the doors were unlocked on my side because I think I went through a secret back entrance and I started feeling I was getting really close to the truth. As I went in closer to the heart of the truth, the building was getting smaller around me - doorways or  (...)",

A woman with long brown hair and I bonded because she got the same basic version - later we both remarked that we should have gotten the one with the global world view or universalist view, not just American! “How small minded of us,” we laughed! There was this idea that there was a broader view larger than global, larger than maybe even universal, and we were acknowledging the barrier to learning. We made a plan to meet up later, and we were walking on the world like walking on the globe. We were space walking, but it was like on trees and we were going from planet to planet like it was nothing. We were wearing headphones and she pointed to them and “Standing on the Moon” was playing but scratchy like old old records sound from the 1920s. Usually that song makes me emotional but I remember feeling nostalgic. There was supposed to be a list a day of who to invite. There was a dad of Asian descent and two of his kids - a boy and a girl - and it was strange to see a boy.

    "text": "“The Scaffold” This dream begins in some kind of childcare setting. I’ve applied to work there. The dream opens up on what I think is my first day of work. So I walk into a classroom. There are maybe 13 to 15 kids and they look to be around an early school age, like 5 or 6 years old. There are two teachers attending them. As soon as I arrive in the room, they leave. I think, “Wow, way to throw me into this.” But within a few minutes, another teacher comes in and she introduces herself. She tells me she's there to train me. I think, “Well, that’s good then because that was my understanding.” She starts describing the curriculum to me and giving me a little bit of information about each child. I’m taking this in and feeling that sounds familiar, as I’ve worked in this kind of educational setting before. We start to collect what we’ve done with the kids up and tell them it’s time to put their things away and get ready to go outside for outdoor time. The kids start going out the door. There’s something out in the playground. It’s really, really large. It’s large enough that it’s leaving a shadow on the window of the classroom. I can’t see how high up it goes. It’s quite looming. There are some men on it who are working on it, too. It has the feel of one of those scaffolds that construction sites have where you climb up and up and up to work on something at the top. It’s a safe platform for people as opposed to a ladder, which is not very safe and kind of flimsy. So there are a few men on this and they’re busy with it. I do note (not in my dream, but after waking), one of the men is black. There are also some plants that are starting to overgrow the bottom of whatever structure this is. They’re moving from this structure into the building. So while the person who is training me is supervising the playground, I am trying to moveis plant that is starting to grow inside the door of the classroom. It feels really strong in my hands.

They’re European or Swedish by nationality, but ethnicity ranges with Asian girls and black girls. They’re all female-bodied and from this one school. They’re sitting in rows in desks and I’m facing them, looking at them. There’s a big green screen behind them. To their right is a male teacher/interviewer. He is asking them these trivia quotations and they’re answering. But he’s a little bit off. Every once in a while he says something that’s super off-color or super sexist or just super objectifying. At one point I hear him saying, “And don’t they all have glorious tits?” I’m like, “What the fuck did he just say?” He says that kind of stuff, but the girls, instead of taking offence, they just own it and make it their own - not in the giggling way and giving away of power, but in a “oh so you noticed, idiot, good.” It’s a very interesting dynamic. But they’re still young. I can feel they’re young and they don’t know everything because they haven’t experienced everything. It’s just so strange. This is all being televised and people are watching. At some point, my focus shifts from these young ladies to the show host. He kind of beckons me over. He wants me to look at the green screen.

He’s teaching me how to grow a6 vegetable garden. The plot is quite large. There’s room for enough vegetables that will have to be kept over the winter. It will definitely feed maybe 6-8 people for a whole year. It's planned out quite meticulously with companion planting as well as staggered planting so that you don’t get a bumper crop of the same thing all at once. There’s corn and cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, cauliflower, beets, carrots, squash, lettuce, rhubarb, and herbs; and marigolds and chrysanthemums around the outside as a natural insecticide. Once it gets planted, which is quite a lengthy process, then we have to go back in and set up structures that will support the things as they grow upwards. There is something that looks like it’s for tomatoes, but it’s not in the tomato row. It’s suspended and there’s little baskets. I can’t figure out how it’s suspended because there’s nothing above it except sky. Then when I look at it, there are bits of other vegetables in it. I can see that there are pieces of cauliflower, so I’m puzzling over this. It also spins. There are about four of these on a long bar. I ask my dad what it is. He keeps appearing. Although I’ve done this all by myself, whenever I’m not sure what I’m doing, my dad just appears for guidance. While I’m puzzling over this, suddenly he is there again. I say, “What’s this for?” He says, “The vegetables on it are composting. The gas they emit is good for the atmosphere that the other vegetables are growing in. It’s like a Natural Miracle Grower.” I think, “Oh. Hmm, I didn't think methane was good to be near people.” So I get this garden going. There’s also another part where I’m fertilizing or something.

They had two small white dogs and a very small pet pig or something and there was another really small alligator or some reptile that could only stay in the kitchen and pace north to south on the kitchen floor, and there was like some type of instrument that would let us know that it was only going north to south, and it had covers over its feet. The two dogs were small white and matching and they could go anywhere in the apartment. I think the apartment was somewhere in New York City. It reminded me of New York somehow - it was for a couple but I don’t think it was for me. I was watching this like a movie. I was back with the group of people then we all went to IKEA to get the furniture and it turned into a mob. We were all walking counterclockwise and shoulder to shoulder and kept going in a circle trying to grab the items that we needed and couldn’t communicate with the other people we were with about what they were getting and we just kept throwing things into a pile of pillows and rugs. I kept trying to work my way over to people to make sure we were getting the right things but it was impossible to maneuver and there were all these different huge pillows that go on couches oversized on oversized like too big for words and it was really frustrating and I don’t even think they were for me- they went to the people in this apartment. Then it flashed back to the apartment and the landlord was saying something about how the reptile was doing okay going north to south in the kitchen but that he’s been hearing the couple argue in the corner of the apartment.

It reminds me of being in a casino where they keep the lights dark so you don’t know what time it is, so the contrast is weird when I walk outside. I walk down this dirt road. There are fields on either side and barbed wire fences. I think I’m barefoot and I still have his briefcase. I keep walking. I am going past these houses and notice that some of them are old and falling apart - they are the original houses of the neighborhood. And then there are some new gigantic behemoth houses. The new houses are just huge - all I can see is rooftop after rooftop and I can’t even see the backend of these houses. Then I get past these houses and there are two separate little farms. The houses are older. It’s clearly a one-person show. Fruits and vegetables are planted and there are flowers. There’s also hay for mulching. I’m walking down the lane, then actually walk through the garden because it’s so inviting. Then I cross over this boundary - a space of land in between these two farms or houses with gardens - to go to the other little farm. Then I realize the ground underneath me is all hot coals, but my feet are not burning. I’m wanting to cross and get around, but suddenly I’m in a labyrinth and I can’t get out of it. The two owners of the house come out - two older white women. They are trying to help me get out of this little inbetween land that is basically all hot coals. It’s burning their feet, but not mine. They say, “Well, you can go that way, but you’re going to burn yourself.” But I’m not getting burned. I don’t go the way I think I’m going to go because they say I’m going to burn myself, but it’s not hot. At one point I do get out and wave goodbye to  (...)",

    "text": "“The Night Walk” This dream starts in a house that’s mine. It’s a different kind of house - open concept. It’s two levels. There is a lot of space in the rooms. There aren’t a lot of contents in each room. I cook something for supper. It’s some kind of pasta with weird sauce. There’s this piece of chicken with breading on it. My conscious mind is thinking, “Ew, I never make food like that.” The pasta is kind of dry and so is the chicken. I don’t make things with breading. I eat a little bit of supper and don’t really like it. I take about three bites and leave it. I tell my child - the child is a mixture of my son and daughter at the same time - we’re going to go for a walk after supper. It needs to be dark, so we are waiting until it gets dark. We leave out the house. I had something in my hand. The walk is down a path. We go out first through a field and then through an opening in some rocks which we go underneath. Then there is a fork and I say we need to take the path on the left. We climb up a steep ascent and navigate that. Then there’s a ridge to follow along. There’s a vista here before we climb up. Suddenly it zooms out and you can see how vast this landscape is - it’s like an escarpment and really quite beautiful. Then it zooms back in and we’re standing there. It’s a long hike. So we hike for probably half the night. I have this feeling in my body where it’s a tiny bit scary. But I have my child with me and I don’t want to communicate my own fear to my child. So I do quite well at appearing brave and courageous. The landscape is very pretty even in the night. There’s a feeling of lush. It feels Canadian with a mix of evergreen, deciduous trees. It’s cool, but not too cold or too hot. I can feel the packed dirt underneath my feet. It’s not too overgrown. It’s not a very wide path, so some of the grasses have grown into it. But you can still see the path ahead, so we aren’t night blind. There is enough light from the moon and the stars that we can see the p (...)",

We’re all being trained to fly airplanes. It’s wartime. These are the kind of planes you see from old photos - the original planes that are all open with no cockpit and only room for one person. The airplanes are all lined up and we’re all lined up getting into our airplanes. I’m getting into my airplane and am wearing shorts - not enough clothes. So I suddenly think I should get some more clothes on. I have some because we are all packed and ready to go. I get some of the clothes out and put them on. I get in the airplane. We’re learning how to fly and have never taken a plane up before. It’s time to go fly these planes now. I’m a little panicked because I don’t feel like I know how to really fly the plane yet. But we go. The airplanes in front of me each start to take off. Then I take off. I’m flying okay. We’re all supposed to meet someplace before we head off to our attack. As I’m flying the plane, my heart is pounding because I don’t feel I have this down. I fly over this school. It’s a college - an old college with buildings with spires and ivy covering the brick walls. I’m flying over and around and I am trying to catch up with the group. I’m having a hard time flying the plane and end up going in circles around this college. I do end up landing the plane on a rooftop. It’s still dark - nighttime. I land the plane and get out on the roof. I climb down the wall and am looking in the windows of the building. There are kids inside. I climb down like I’m going to do some reconnaissance. The whole time I’m panicking that I’m not with the rest of the planes. I’m not really sure what it is I’m doing now, why I’m there or what I’m looking for. I am looking for something, though.

Feels like an educational environment, bigger than a high school. University? Seems utterly real, and everything is there to the last detail. The only thing missing was ambient noise. Could have been Centerville, but didn't much look like it. A bigger, older city. This guy, fairly good looking. I see his face very clearly. He's twentyish. He's walking along in my direction, smiles at me, greets me. He wants to become acquainted. Much forgotten. I chat him up, and this develops. Before I know it, two friends of his also there. Now we're walking outside along a major arterial. It's night. We come to the brow of a hill. Not very dramatic, but the road does start to go down. I look at him. His name was Kyle. I ask him, can you fly? So somehow I knew I was a dreaming. Turns out he and his friends could fly, so we take off and skip over the next however many blocks. I'm ecstatic. Finally I have friends I can fly with, after doing it by myself fo so long! We land, and now Kyle is gone. Much forgotten. Somehow I have his wallet, and a poster of his, in a large plastic bag. We never exchanged contact information. I intend to look through his wallet to see if there is an address, perhaps on his driver's license, but I never get around to it. Stuff keeps happening. I put his wallet in my right back pocket (I keep my wallet in my left back pocket, and it is there and I don't lose it). As time goes on I lose the poster, but I never lose either wallet. I check several times, and they are always there. I feel terrible, and terrible for him. I don't know how I ended up with it, but I have it, and he doesn't. He probably doesn't know I have it, and even if he does he has no way to contact me. Then it turns into a university campus in Middletown. A brief episode with some guy, English accent.

I don’t think it’s Lake Ontario because it touches the US in a bigger way. It has the flavor of Fort Erie or Crystal Beach or one of those kinds of places. It’s got that carnival kind of American bordertown atmosphere. I’m staying there temporarily - maybe a weekend. I’m with some friends. I can’t identify any of them, except Peggy, my daughter’s boyfriend’s aunt. She’s in the boat that I’m in when we go out for a little bit of water fun on the lake. She’s describing that we have to maneuver ourselves around the ships that are coming in the opposite direction. She gives them some kind of nickname like Shoe Boat. I wonder what she means by that nickname because I’ve never heard that before. One of them actually looks like the shape of a shoe if you use your imagination. There are a lot coming in. The person who’s driving the boat is not me. It’s a motorboat - something I don’t normally choose to be in. The person driving knows how to navigate around the oncoming traffic of all the boats coming in the opposite direction towards the shore. So we get around them and then we have some kind of water sport that we can get in the water and do. I’m hazy on one that is - it’s not water skiing, it’s not floating, I’m not sure what I’m doing. However, we do this for a little bit, get back in the boat, and then are driven back to the little town where we’re staying. I guess I’m in a motel because it’s on the ground. It doesn’t feel like a hotel that goes up. Once I’m back in my room, I gather up laundry. I take the basket, walk up the street up a bit, and then go into this run down little store. It’s dark in there. My eyes adjust to the light -it’s an evening kind of dark, the kind of dark in a building that has really dirty windows or maybe no windows at all.

He wants to do some card trick involving my driver's license. I'm a little dubious, but I let him have it. I assume it will be temporary. Typical magic trick, there's some distraction. We start talking about something else, and then he asks me where my driver's license is. I look in my wallet, forgetting that I had given it to him, and then he can't give it back to me.

We have to put all this away.” There are a bunch of brand new carts out in this open space in the store. They have orange handles and our carts have green handles, so I’m looking at these orange handles and one of my other coworkers who is also a manager says, “Hey, can you clean that one cart right there?” It has all this sticky stuff on it - I don’t know if it’s honey or maple syrup or what.

The fence has been broken and they’re trying to figure out how to move the pieces around to make a solid fence and container for the lawn again.

The odd thing is that my grandparents are sleeping in the room I always slept in when I was there and I am sleeping in their room. But this one particular day, I get up in the middle of the night and they’re still sleeping. I walk down the long hallway into the kitchen. I just sit there.

I notice the dynamic between them in a way I never did when I was a child in that house. I’m noticing personalities and why they act the way they do. I spend a few hours doing this in the kitchen. Then I get up from the table and go over to see if there is anything on the stove. I make sure all the burners are off. Then I walk down the hallway into the room my grandparents used to sleep in. I get into the bed and lie there for a while awake. As I’m lying there, my consciousness wanders out the sliding patio doors into the grounds that are around the house.

It was forbidden to take any national flags or insignia into the zone. To keep the temperature down. the beach is very long and broad, and extremely crowded. The tide is way out, and the lower beach is covered with these odd, olive green and brown plants. A rosette of fairly broad leaves leaves coming from the base. The beach is paved with them.

The other part is made of logs also tied tightly together with ropes. There’s a gap between these two parts. Mia and I are on the logs. The ocean is pretty choppy. My husband is nearby on a surfboard. Every now and again a huge shark goes by and it’s making me feel unsettled and frightened. A huge shark goes right under our raft and makes the waves even choppier right around us. Then another huge shark goes right over our raft and slips between the gap between the buckets and logs. I see that it’s bloodied and has a rope tied tightly around its fins. Mia doesn’t seem concerned because even though these sharks are huge, they won’t directly attack us. But then we are actually under attack. Great Whites spot us. Mia says, “Okay Viviane, we’ve gotta dive.” So we lay flat on our stomachs and make the raft plunge down under the waves as you would do with a surfboard. We plunge away from the shark and miss it. But as we rise up, the tip of our raft knocks the underbelly of a huge hammerhead shark. We have to dive again before surfacing and continue diving deep. I hope we don’t run out of air and I hope this tactic protects us from the sharks. My husband is doing the same thing on his surfboard. Somehow we all make it safely out of the water to the station. The station is where they provide gear and simple food and coffee/tea. They also collect stories from people’s time out in the water. A guy is telling us this. Mia begins explaining our story. My husband chimes in, too.",

I'm walking, on foot, not floating. I'm not sure where to go. At first, it doesn't seem like it will be complicated. I'm crossing 11th street, and see where 12th is, so think I need to go in the other direction, down to 4th or 5th. At that point it's a question of half a dozen blocks. But as the dream goes on, things expand. As I walk through the neighborhood, which is dense but pleasant, with big street trees and late 19th century brick building of three or fours stories, there are occasional abandoned buildings. I turn to the right and come into a big, complex, brick courtyard, where there used to be a brewery. I marvel at it, and think how different it is from my part of the country. Now I'm at the edge of a very extensive park. I knew my cellphone wouldn't work, wasn't working, or needed a charge. But what I take out of my pocket is an Iphone that isn't even mine. Not even sure if I was able to turn it on. There's quite a long steep hill, with a road or a path leading through and to the top of this park. I get the idea to walk to the top of the hill to get a territorial view and figure out where I need to go. I start walking up this long steep hill, and ask myself whether I have the strength and stamina to do it, to go up the hill and to get home. Going up the hill, inside a grotty space, attached to a men's latrine. Old, concrete stairs going up, and a metal railing. I go to touch it as I begin to go up the stairs, and it's wet and slightly sticky. I recoil, and vow not to touch it again. A bit inside some interpretive center, about some Native American stuff. Previous inhabitants of the area, perhaps. An odd machine, compact, medium shade of blue, like a little robot, not humanoid, that somehow goes awry and enters a very small apartment of some people I don't know. It thrashes (...)",

It’s a huge barn that has been converted into a boutique with gorgeous gowns hanging up on the walls all the way up to the ceiling. I’m looking for a particular style because the other dress was torn. It’s like an art gallery. I find a similar dress but with more vibrant colors. I ask for help getting it down. The woman who works here is thin and old with dry wrinkled skin. Her eyes are very bright and alive. She seems to know something I don’t know yet. Then she tells me that they have a dream group that meets here every other Tuesday. The man who leads this dream group is so eccentric and people really love him and adore him. I’m a little interested but also wary and doubtful of a man with such charisma and appeal. Then I’m walking down a hall in this big barn which I now realize is a retreat center. I see a sandwich board with an announcement for this dream workshop which happens to be this day later this evening. I then encounter this beautiful man in the hallway and there is something so magnetizing between the two of us. We are immediately drawn together and he’s pressing me against the wall. We are having an ecstatic sexual encounter, even though I’ve never seen him before. Then we smoothe down our clothes and go our individual ways. The old woman from the art dress show has arranged for me to have dinner with this dream teacher. So I go and am surprised to see the elegant dining room within the barn.

Everyone is busy with something. Suddenly, I’m inside a building. It’s quite steamy. There are people washing dishes. The dishes are really big. There are parts and pieces of machines that have been used to process food. I don't know what the parts assemble to as a whole. I feel curious about this as I’m helping people. I don’t know the people I’m working with. So I’m helping carry the pieces in and setting them on something that looks like a conveyor belt. I notice this one piece. It’s really oddly shaped. It’s about 2 feet wide and 2 feet high. It’s covered with sticky potato. I think it’s been used to make mashed potatoes. But the potato is all stuck to it. Then there’s this big hose thing that’s suspended from the ceiling. It’s kind of springy. I squeeze the trigger and the water comes out at a very high pressure. I’m trying to get the water out of this. At one point there’s a sieve thing on it. I’m trying to get it out of there before it goes into the conveyor belt and into the dishwasher. Other people around me and they’re moving really fast. They’re doing this same thing and wash everything. A woman comes in. She’s got a clipboard. She has a pinched face and is very disapproving-looking. She practically gets in the way with her criticism of what everyone is doing. I can feel her gaze on me as I’m helping. I feel like she’s centered me out as though I’m not supposed to be there and my skill level isn’t up to par. It’s a whole demeanor like, “I’m going to watch you even closer.” She’s making me nervous now. I don’t know if I’m standing on the right side of the conveyor belt because of her disapproval.

The little car is able to negotiate the snow and hills quite well. One fairly steep block, wondered if I would get up it, but I did. Some furniture store? I was trying to get to. I'd been there before, and wanted to go back. Daytime now, no snow. In the dream I'm not exactly sure where I am. I think I'm a bit south of Broadway, so turn north, and there is a long downhill stretch, not terribly steep toward an arterial that I can see ahead that I think is Broadway. Turns out not to be. I decide to turn left, and have to wait a long time for traffic to clear before I can make the turn. No light at this intersection. When I finally turn I see that I actually needn't have waited, as the way the traffic is coming, and the road that I am turning onto, which is rather a highway, are not quite as I had thought them to be. At one point, while it is snowing, I have to stop and check the windshield wipers, as they didn't seem to be getting the snow off, but then they were. Then I think, dang, you bought this car in Canada. I guess you can bring it home. I wasn't sure. As I drive down the hill I worry about that.

The building is unremarkable, low and square and squat, no ornamentation. I go in, and there's a congregation and family. Stapleman is there, and later Danielle and Adam, in addition to bunches of other people. Stapleman wants to know if I've spoken to my mom lately. He wanted to brag that he had just spoken to her, more recently than I had. He says she has some message for me. He doesn't tell me what it is. Mom was grateful to be going home. Something like that. I see Danielle but don't interact with her. A point where I'm in some room, and I see Adam. He's eight or ten years old, and has his back to me. He's on a computer, doing something, very focussed. I don't try to talk to him. I'm in some side room and there's a bunch of middle aged Jewish men, various types, all very well educated. Two of them have a learned conversation. In the dream I heard every word, but it's gone now. Others are reading things that look like the New York Review of Books, or the like. I think a service is about to begin. I'm not dressed for it, having bare feet and wearing jeans. I wonder if my bare feet are insulting, but nobody seems to mind. I do have my ball cap on, which felt weird, but was ok, though a kippa would have been better. One by one the guys leave, until there are only one or two left. I think, okay, I guess no service, so I leave too. Now I'm trying to leave. I go through a room off the social hall, the kitchen, and Danielle and one other woman is there, who reminds me of Willanda.

He has a wife, but we’re hanging out together. I don’t know what exactly we’re doing. We’re exploring some kind of weird relationship. The scene stays in mind of us in bed together. I’ve thrown the covers back to get out of bed and I’ve started my period. There’s a little bit of blood on the sheets. I’m wearing underwear, which is crazy because I don’t. There’s blood on the inside of the underwear and it has seeped through. I take the underwear off and go to take a shower. I’m sitting on the toilet and am rinsing the underwear in cold water. I see the words “Blockbuster” stamped on the inside of the underwear. I’m watching the blood disappear. I get up and come back to the bedroom and the man’s wife is there. We’ve both known he’s married and she’s fine with me being around. She’s older - their age is matched. I come back and she’s there. It’s like they’re caretaking me in a way. It feels strange. In another scene, my daughter is a toddler, 2 or 3 years old. She’s how she was as a baby - on me all the time.

As I look, I realize, it’s not a life-sized cardboard cutout image of her, but it’s actually her. She sees me, releases the pose and walks to me. I am amazed by her height. She is towering over me. I give her a hug and my face is at the level of her yoni. She is about to teach a full day workshop series at the studio. Right now it’s 3am and her first class starts at 5. I have other obligations during the day, so I can't go. I could have gone to this first class, but don’t. I putter around my day. There is a woman that I knew from elementary school. She has rigged the elections to be something like a homecoming queen. There are quite a few obligations and functions she’s participating in to raise funds for the school. She’s doing a great job and has the perfect southern smile and hospitality, but she wasn’t actually fairly elected.

I’m in a town and the only reason I go there is to teach at the Yoga Studio. This is the real life part of this dream. There are street vendors outside of the Yoga Studio door. The street is really long. There are all kinds of stores and vendors. I stop after walking a long time. I’m standing in front of one of the stores and it’s some kind of curio shop. I talk to three vendors and I’m not sure if they all own the store or if one of them is friends with the people who own it and they’re just sitting together and chatting. I chat with them for a bit then enter the store. The store is dark and dusty. It’s like there is a window somewhere because the lighting is natural, but it’s as though the light is coming through a really dirty window. So it’s dim inside, but I know there isn’t an artificial fluorescent source of light. There are so many things inside and they are stacked in front of the window, so it’s hard to see. I stand and wait until my eyes adjust a little bit. I’m trying to see what are all these things. I can’t really identify anything. They are objects, possibly books, a combination of both. Nothing really stands out as a single object or book. I walk around the store. There’s a part of me that likes that musty smell of history. Even though I can’t discern what the things are, I actually like being in this store. I’m not there to buy anything. I’m simply curious. I stay in there for a bit. There’s a feeling of comfort. Eventually, I exit the store. I’m standing out on the street again. I see some people I know who I have taught at the Yoga Studio. They’re heading towards the studio. I’m thinking to myself: “Oh, was I supposed to teach?” I didn’t realize the studio had reopened. I enter the studio and people are leaving as though a class has just finished.

There are a whole bunch of these scattered about a piece of land. There are a lot of people. I’m not there to particularly attend. It’s a program of events going on. Each tent has something else going on in it. I seem to be doing my own thing. As I’m walking down the middle of all these tents, I see one with a person leading a discussion. I see one of my son’s friend’s moms, Melissa. She’s Noah’s mom. She’s sitting and listening, attending one of these discussions. I go in and sit down. The leader of the discussion is telling people that shows of emotion are problematic and that people who do this are making social issues seem worse than they actually are, even small things like using two exclamation marks and spamming emojis contribute to this exaggeration of emotion. The lecturer is pointing how this is bringing the whole of society down. And then the lecturer points out: “Here are ways you can change your overly emotional behavior and start to tone it down, keep it small, don’t react.” The lecturer doesn’t actually have a gender, they are androgenous. They say, “And this is how you can keep it out of your face.” I look over at Melissa and I notice that her face looks so much more serious, and she normally looks very expressive and happy. The lecture is over now. I linger waiting to speak with her. Of course she sees me, but doesn’t react and walk over. So I go over and sit with her. I’m asking her: “Are you buying into this? What do you think?” She says, “Oh, I’ve been doing this for some time now.” She shows me a couple examples of her recent writing. Then she tells me that she is also practicing it in terms of celibacy. She hasn’t had any “action” in quite a few months. I say, “Well, maybe that’s making it easier to be less emotional and less expressive, but when you do have intimacy and share with someone again, you’re going to hav (...)",

They are actually of all different economic classes and genders. They’re returning from a long trip or in the midst of a big move. At one point, I’m with a small group of friends who I don’t know from waking life. One is transmasculine (the night before, I watched a documentary about transexuals in Hollywood). This woman comes up to my friend and is really loud and so proud of herself for thinking she knows anything about him. She says, “Oh my gosh, it’s so good to see you sister!” That really upsets him - not in an angry way, but in a sad way. He gets quiet and leaves. I have to talk with her about it and tell her, “No, we call him brother, even those of us who know about his transition.” She kind of understands. The hotel has an annex of some sort - not a gift shop, but an upscale Ikea type furniture store with all kinds of household items. I’m walking around looking for things to replace the things that were old and rusted from the trip here. I lose my wallet after setting it down somewhere and walk away. I’m starting to panic. After some time of looking, someone comes up to me and asks: “Is this yours?” I say, “Yes, thank goodness. It’s mine.” In another part of the dream, I have to move out of the hotel room where I’ve stashed all my stuff including my cat. It’s a blue cat. I have to go somewhere else because the room is too expensive and too nice for all my crap. A man comes to help me. I’m going to stay with his cousin. He’s a black man. I go to the room and show him my stuff. He’s disgusted by the state of things, especially one table with a microwave that is dirty, rusted and splattered with old food. It looks as if there could be varmints inside, too. He says, “No, my cousin won’t let you have this in his home. No way.” We’re trying to figure out what to do with it - just throw it away or if I need it moving forwa (...)",

He’s old enough to get dressed himself and he comes out wearing this. Even though he seems to be younger, he’s also 9 - his age is ambiguous. My brother is young and looks as though he did in high school. My sister also looks younger, like how she did in high school. There’s a break in college and we’ve all met up between classes and have gone out onto this rooftop. You can see this black wall of clouds off in the distance. They are turning greenish and as I’m watching, they form a funnel and there’s a tornado heading our direction. I’m yelling at my son to go in the door we came out of onto this rooftop. There’s also a set of fire escape stairs. My brother is over there. My brother and sister were excited about the parties they were going to go to. They are totally doing the college thing.

My brother and sister do not believe me and just stay out there. I watch through this thick glass window. As the storm tornado goes by, this woman appears and she’s sitting in a chair. The chair is small and wooden with two slots across the back. It’s like she was the tornado or was in the tornado. She’s telling my siblings what to do. So instead of the tornado sucking them up and carrying them off, she’s telling them to go jump off the edge of the roof. She’s saying, “You’re going to die either way, but I’m telling you that instead of sucking you up, you’re just going to jump off.” I’m horrified. I want my siblings!

The conversation with my dad ends and the other people who are sitting around start to get up and are leaving in various directions. There's a room that is currently dark.

I’ve driven down Kent St and have turned left onto William, then turn right on Russell, left on Lindsey St, left on Kent and right on William. Then I turn the car around so I’m traveling back up William to Kent St. I turn left on Kent, left on Lindsey St and then go behind the stores to a little parking lot and leave my car there. Now I’m on foot and I have both of my kids. I walk back through the same route. As I’m going past a building on William St, I tell my kids that it used to be an old hotel that dates back to the time of the Orangemen and the structure of it at the very bottom is based in intolerance and hate and that I believe it has influenced every other business that has been built on top of it since the late 1800s. A man is listening or he just overhears and argues. He says, “There was nothing there before the 1970s. I tell him, “No, that’s incorrect. I worked here for a very short period of time a long, long time ago. I’ve seen those exact roots.” When I’m saying “roots” I’m picturing old brick at the bottom that I’ve seen with my own eyes. He contradicts me and says that isn’t so. I just walk away because I know there’s no point arguing with somebody who doesn’t know anything and who’s like that. He sits down at this patio table with two of his friends and the server brings out three burgers and they all have a different kind of topping and they all have a different name. She names them as she lays them down on the table. I look and see they are all just burgers. We continue on foot around the route I already described. When we get to the back of the storefronts where I parked the car, I ask my kids if they’re hungry because we’ve been walking around and it’s quite hot out. They say they do. I take them to this tiny place up the street that serves fish and chips. Then, the dream shifts. I’m making up s (...)",

Some business about a second pair of pants. Something to do with a dirty latrine, and I guess I got my pants dirty in there somehow? Swapping my belt between them. I'm wearing one pair and carrying the other, but now the other pair is not dirty. I also have a package of ground beef, as from the store. I need to get that into the fridge. I was going to have some for breakfast, but never get to, because I'm too late. Somewhere I had a locker, and it was going to be okay. People are lining up for lunch. The cafeteria has its own building. I go to get in line. A young woman there I know vaguely doesn't acknowledge me. I rather thought she should have. A friend of mine, a guy, together we go to this other buffet line, but it isn't the right one for our class. It's some middle schoolers'. But we get in the line, and it will be okay.",

She is there and she has arranged her whole wardrobe out of the closets, arranging the clothing by style and function. It’s some kind of estate sale. I’m looking at a rack of clothes with an older Chinese woman and the woman who owns the house. The owner is holding out a nice little dress suit for the Chinese woman who is kind of interested. She puts it on, but then takes off the short sleeved blouse/jacket and is really excited about the sexy strappy dress underneath. She keeps looking at the clothes and is pulling out the tight form-fitting strappy dresses. We all think it’s pretty cute that she likes this sexy style. I’m looking at beautiful sexy lingerie. I try on one and love it and another one that I also love. There’s another one that’s still in its packaging. I hold it up against my body and the lady of the house is nodding her head in approval. I decide to take all of them. Later in the dream, the man of the house is coming home. Rose and I are performing for him individually. He will choose which one of us he prefers. I do this beautiful sensual presentation that is soft and gently inviting. Then Rose does this wildly evocative and erotic demonstration that is outwardly very sexy. I’m sure he is going to choose her especially because she is so tall and gorgeous. His assistant nods at me and has me wait. He leaves and comes back a while later. He is ascending the stairs with two bunches of wild roses of pastel colors wrapped in brown paper. He gives them to me. He has chosen me.",

There are multiple themes to this convention - things are being demoed and sold, but it’s also a CrossFit convention because every person is jacked and totally yoked, including the women. I think, “Eh, I used to look like that and I don’t anymore. I’m glad I don't.” It’s not a judgment against them, though. I’m just glad I’m not in the CrossFit mindset. I’m here with some people - a woman who is a little shorter than me with longer brown hair. Her vibe is the vibe of my ex and I’m not liking her. She seems to be doing stuff that makes no sense. She buys a charcoal grill that is red, brand new and shiny and clean. I turn to her and say, “We actually have a charcoal grill at home that looks exactly like that, but it’s black. Why are you buying a new one?” She’s not computing that we don’t need another one. She’s just in it for the thrill of buying, I think. I just don’t understand why she can’t understand that we don’t need another one. Then, the other person I’m with is a man. He’s buying a truck - a huge black truck. Part of me is like, “Can you even afford that truck? I think you actually owe me money, so how are you paying for that truck?” At one point we try these demo treadmills. An instructor is walking people through a HIT workout - high intensity training. There are a bunch of CrossFitters. He says, “Everyone has to keep their treadmill at six.” I’m struggling to keep it at six and last for 15 or 30 seconds. I’m like, “This isn’t for me.” This is not my norm - normally I would just push until I won. I just didn’t. I’m like, “Yeah, you all go ahead do this. I’m not interested.“ I get off the treadmill. Then I wonder where my kids are. This couple I was with reminds me of my ex and maybe his girlfriend. I’m really concerned. He was supposed to be watching them and says, “Well, they’re off with friends.” I have no idea who my daughter is with and I never see her in the dream, but I have this worry for her because I don't know where she is.

It’s not clear where I’m going except that once we get onto the plane, I see this mental map of where it’s going and what countries I’m passing. It feels like we’re on our way to New Zealand. At the airport, I don’t realize that we have to take some kind of shuttle. I’m unclear as to why we have to take a shuttle when we’re already at the airport. However, it’s included with our ticket. We wait in this line. There are six of us and tons of other people. It’s packed. I guess there’s a number of shuttles because we wait, the crowd moves, we wait again, the crowd moves. So, as we are moving again I’m thinking, “Okay, this time we’re actually going to get on the shutte.” The shuttle is shaped like a mini airplane. The cockpit area is very short and then there is a little bit wider area. The seats in the cockpit area are like parallel parking - there are five on each side and once you get in, you’d be facing each other. Then the seats are more facing forward like an actual airplane with two and an aisle and two more. They’re facing the cockpit. I get separated from my friends because there are only five seats in the cockpit area. I have to sit in the first row of seats facing forward. I look over and who sits beside me but Donald Trump. I am completely horrified. I’m trying to squish myself as close to the side of the plane as I can. I’m just in shock, thinking: “How did this happen, how did this happen, how did this happen?” I keep thinking I'm In a plane but it’s taxiing down a major highway. I’m so invested in the idea that it’s a plane and it’s taxiing that when we’re going through traffic, I’m thinking the wings are going to be clipped off. I have to keep reminding myself that we’re not on the plane yet. Because I’m sitting beside Donald Trump, there are reporters and people with cameras and other people behind us that are trying to take pictures. That’s why I’m trying to shrink away from him - I don’t (...)",

His hair is brown and below his ears with a little curl - it’s tousled by salt and wind. He’s not wearing a shirt, just pants resting low on his hips. He’s wearing a necklace, like a mala that is slightly loose, so I can see a bit of string between the wooden beads. He touches his necklace, pulling it a bit away from his neck and chest, then lets it fall again as some kind of invitation to me. I walk towards him.",

I arrive at my final exam presentation and instead of speaking, I need to dance to a specific song. It’s a dramatic ballet. After the performance, I become aware that I have just shaped the future/changed the future. I receive awareness/communication within myself that I have changed the course of history by this act, a classmate is forever changed by the dance and is influenced by art instead and he no longer becomes an evil politician but rather a philanthropist of the arts. It happened again, I was to meet at a bar at a hotel and talk to someone sitting there. I did. We talked about how I was so depressed but then got help and it changed the way I interacted with my own trauma. I gave him the number of my therapist and I became aware that instead of suicide bombing the town at the end of the year, this man I spoke to would fall in love at the end of the year. I started following all of these instincts, knowing I was shaping a better future through small acts of kindness, love, passion, art. It became all consuming. I saw someone having a conversation and I became aware that they were receiving the same kind of transmissions as I had been. I kind of kept an eye on them and eventually they asked if I was following them. I asked why they were doing the things they were doing and eventually we realized we were on the same mission. Soon, we had formed a whole community of receivers. We had meetings and at one meeting I remember bringing the issue to the table that my old self and motivations and trajectories were so changed, like I had died and replaced by prescience. I still had my own memories from before but I was sharing my self and body with this prescience that had nothing to do with me as my own person. We didn’t find a solution but we did mourn and grieve our lives and tried to find ways to remember and be ourselves.",

We've walked out on these docks some distance off shore, maybe 100 yards. We start to go back, and it seems there's no way to get back to the shore without getting wet, partly because the docks are broken down, and partly because they were constructed without forethought. They don't float, and are awash at high tide. We walk on one that is still dry, but it dead ends. Then I see a way around to the right, and it's not quite awash, and good enough. The water is quite calm. We do make it back to shore. Much happens on shore, but is forgotten. I'm living in a photograph [sic] or series of photographs taken from the location where we are standing, looking northwest to the entrance to the Bay, but the geography is different, in that Magnolia is not there, and there is a clear view. In a couple of the photos, as I watch I can see boats going in and out. At one point a large, old, classic yacht. Somehow I'm pasting some url that could be traced back to me into these photos.

I actually worked at two restaurants when I was at university. There are staff from both of these restaurants in this room. Julie married Da and they had a baby. They’re there, too. At first I don’t notice them because they’re all wearing costumes. The people are gathered to go somewhere. Then I leave the room with Julie and Dan and we’re in this other place. They have a baby. I’m asking them where the baby is. Then we just kind of float back and we’re in this room where everyone has gathered again. The costumes are quite elaborate. They are wearing face paint and everyone has had really elaborate things done to their hair. The costumes are like what the Hoop Dancers would wear at pow wow in Canada. In real life, my cat woke me up in the middle of this with a really loud meow right in my face, so it scared me and I lost most of the threads of the first part of this dream.

Half of the straws are decorated with colored balls on the end and the others are plain. She’s got them heaped up as if serving them on the platter. It’s like something she would have done - she would make things and bring them just to make people happy. So she’s down giving these to the hockey players and skaters. She moves through the stands and goes over to where my dad and stepmom are sitting. I’m sitting back from them and am separated from them.

I feel like I’ve just finished doing what I’m supposed to be doing. I wade into the lake, swim for a little bit, and move from a deep area to a more shallow area. There’s some vegetation in the lake - lilly pads and leaves flowing by - and then a wide open area that feels really deep. The water is clean and fresh and this crystal blue. There’s some white cap on the surface and a blue sky above. It’s quite pleasant. I’m floating around and enjoying this. I get out of the water after a bit. I go into a big farmhouse and am doing food preparation and feeding/taking care of some kids. This repeats in the dream several times. This is where the sense of routine and purpose comes in.

When we got back inside our house, my older brother, Carson, pulled out a large bottle of liquid marijuana concentrate from his pocket and offered it to us. I passed as I'd had previous negative experiences with marijuana and CBD oil and didn't see that there'd be any use in it. William also declined. I then asked Carson if he wasn't haunted by the possibility of being in the wrong for using drugs. I told him that I was haunted by this thought every day, though he said it didn't bother him.",

We found a place to sit down on a patch of rocks on the water’s edge and there was a young black man right next to us and I couldn’t take my eyes off him, I knew him, the one from my other dreams. He caught me staring at him and I said, “I’m sorry, you remind me of my friend’s husband (I named him) but I know you’re not him. I feel like I know you.” He introduced himself quietly and smiled so I saw all his teeth but I don’t remember his name. His voice was so kind. He took off his baseball cap and put it on my head over my straw hat, and nestled it in to make sure it was on there. He said something about there’s only eight groups of us at this beach. Then he got in the water. Then Rory and I decided we were hungry, debating between tacos and lobster rolls so we started walking on this decrepit but very crowded boardwalk. We saw lots of artists, lots of homeless people. One woman was sitting in a wheelchair; her face was painted grayish white but her lips were moving and I asked if she was okay but she didn’t answer and everyone kept walking by. She was dying slowly right there invisible but how could you miss her. It was like her body was 95 perfectly entombed. Then the waves started to come at first splashed through the boardwalk and then bigger where we had to hold onto the railings. Then we turned to leave and the waves kept coming and washing out the boardwalk in every direction, the railing was not sturdy; there were areas it was replaced with children safety gates and didn’t feel sustainable and I held on by the tips of my fingers and felt the water lift the rest of my body up and thought I couldn’t hold on any longer. People were just holding on wave after wave and we were losing each other but I wasn’t panicked because I let my body just float when it needed to float and move when it could. The people with their feet on the gro (...)",

I put it there, do some other stuff, then start to think, I'm not really comfortable with then. I had my passport for ID, but if I want to do any driving, I\"m going to need that. There's some pressure of time. There's a bus waiting, and we need to hurry up. I go back into the room where I'd put my driver's license, and furniture has been moved around. I'm not sure where my license is. I look and look, and can't find it. At one point there's a young man who's got some kind of job. He's not the custodian. About twenty, at most. very blond. He starts talking to me about something his girlfriend. I think, whatever. I think, this is an adolescent, saying adolescent type things. Ron Yands comes bounding up the stairs. He's not angry. He's trying to be supportive, so we can get on out of there. The cabinet is made of blond maple, Danish modern design. It was on casters and had been rolled into the corner, and some other furniture placed in front of it I do find the right drawer, but my license isn't there.

I say, “Well I have to be back here at 7 to teach.” He says, “That’s fine. We’ll be back in plenty of time.” I get in the car with him. Immediately, it’s like he’s driving with this really rash intent to get somewhere really quickly. I feel the car is moving more quickly than is safe. Immediately he goes right onto a 7-lane highway. He races over and we stop at a gas station parking lot and there’s a trailer. He asks me if I will hook the trailer to the ball and hitch at the back of the car. I say, “Sure.” I get out of the car. I pick up the end of the trailer with the female end. I think, “Hmm, I wonder if I can lift this without him.” It lifts really easily and I think it’s odd because it should be heavier than this. As I go to attach it to the male end at the back of the car, I notice both ends are made of plastic and realize that’s why it felt too light. As I set the female part on top of the male part, there’s a little cap that’s not quite big enough to reach over the top of the ball. There’s no resounding click when it makes contact. There’s no side pinions that go down through the top to the bottom like there normally would be. Of course, they would have been made of metal, but they’re not. As I’m doing this, I’m picturing the metal one and what the parts and pieces would look like. I’m thinking, “Oh no.

He’s a good dad and has a couple kids. He sells cars and works at the bar a couple shifts a week because he enjoys the people and the contact. He’s asked me to come to the bar, pick something up, and drop something off at his house. I know where the bar is. I drive that way and meet him there. He gives me a package - it’s a rectangle, plain, and grey, almost like a cake box from a bakery but more sturdy and heavier. I go back to my car and put it in my car. He tells me the name of his street because in the dream, I’ve never been to his house. It’s a really strange flow of vowels and consonants together. He tells me very clearly to go down to the end of the street and turn right at the McDonald’s. The street runs parallel to the street that McDonald’s faces. I do this and all that happens is I drive into the parking lot behind the McDonald’s - it belongs to the McDonald’s and doesn’t lead anywhere else. In my confusion, I drive around the area looking for a street with the name, but I can’t find it. I drive back to the bar. As I’m parking the car I see another person - Stephanie - she’s a server but sometimes manages the bar. She has with her a very odd looking dog. She’s nervous about leaving it alone because she’s rescued it from somewhere. So she’s brought it with her to keep it by her side during her shift. She calls it a dog, but it doesn’t look like a dog. It’s small like the size of a miniature poodle. It doesn’t really have poodle hair or even dog hair. It has a thick cotton yarn six-inch long hair or fur or covering. Its face is kind of like a llama. The “dog” is in a bag. She takes it out of the bag. I’m giving her my attention. She’s excited about this creature.

My brother William and I went out to the driveway where a row of short swords were stuck into the ground. We pulled them out more easily than we should have been able to and began testing them. I noted that the lengths were short enough that they would mostly be used for stabbing zombies at close quarters. William preferred a short sword, but I wanted something more along the lines of a fencing sword or rapier. I found one and tested it out. My only concern was that it wouldn't be enough to cut completely through a zombie's head or neck in order to kill it in one swipe. The rest of the family came outside and we began to head out dressed in some form of military garb. At least one of us was wearing camouflage.  We traveled for a ways and setup our camp for the night in some kind of underground cement area under or surrounded by roads. Imagine that part of a road is removed and below the pavement is hollowed out a long rectangular area lined with cement. It's a bit hard to describe. The surrounding landscape was desert-like with mountains in the distance. It had the feeling of largeness and openness. We went to sleep that night in sleeping bags, but some entity came in and began to try to force its way into my sleeping bag. It's slightly translucent hands and arms were reaching in, but by a show of nothing but willpower I was able to make it leave. I found out the next morning that a friend had showed up in the night and had helped save us from the creature. We decided that we had to travel out west and my dad suggested that we walk along the train tracks. My mom pointed out that the authorities would arrest us if we did that, and I, not wanting an argument, made the further point that walking across the gravel of train tracks is painful and slow.

I’m in the building. There’s a man. He’s trying to kill me. I’m trying to hide from him. First I try to hide downstairs. Then I try to get away from him by going up one floor and hiding in some of the rooms. Then I’m able to make it back down the stairs and out the front door. But he finds me outside because there’s nothing to hide in outside. It’s a slightly industrial area and there are no cars in the parking lot. The parking lot is vast. There are no trees. None of the other stores are open in that little stripmall. So I go back in the same building. He’s still trying to kill me. This time there are a few people in the store. He owns the business in the building. He’s distracted by them and has to deal with them because they’re his customers. I’m trying to find a room where I can hide again. This time there are a few more things in the building and in the rooms, like furniture; whereas, the first time it was empty so he could just see me everywhere. This works for a little bit. But now I’m trying to find a way to get help. The same thing happens. When he finishes with the customers, he’s finding me. I go upstairs. There is more furniture to hide behind and the chase is delayed because of the furniture. This time when I head downstairs from upstairs, there’s even more people and more furniture. I’m trying to tell someone that he’s chasing me. It’s like I can’t get close enough to tell anyone so they can hear me. But it’s busier, so this delays it even more. Now I have some kind of job to do there. There’s some kind of involvement with serving food. Now people are eating. He has to make sure they eat. Now he’s a manager or something. I’m trying to make connections with people so I can sit with them and communicate to them that as soon as this meal is over this man is going to try to k (...)",

I’m either looking for food and have bought food from what used to be a McDonald’s, but things still look weird post-quarantine and there’s only limited availability. The golden arches sign is no longer available to be used. I’ve bought boxed cereal and some other items, but they’re stale. I’m going back to return them. I’ve gone inside the building. I have these two big grocery bags with the cereal and other stuff. I go back to the counter and tell the woman who’s working behind the counter in her viser and McDonald’s uniform that I’m returning these. The whole time I’m thinking that you can’t return cereal to McDonald’s, they don’t do returns. But she takes the cereal and whatever else I have in the bag. I’m really relieved. It was a big pain in the ass and burden to have all this cereal and other stuff that was stale and I couldn’t eat and spent money. I was relieved to get my money back, but also surprised. The scene shifts and I’m in a gigantic empty warehouse. A wedding or birthday is happening - something is being celebrated. But again, things are kind of strange because the crowd is sparse. There is a pastor or somebody doing the marrying or celebrating...or maybe someone has graduated? My friend from high school, Teresa, is there. She’s all by herself. I see her but she doesn’t see me yet. It’s been years and years since we’ve seen each other and I’m really excited. But for the moment our focus is on what’s happening in this party thing. The ceremony concludes and there’s a handful of other people - some men - one of which I think is her husband and the husband’s side of the family. I’m watching because it seems odd that she’s not hanging out with or sitting next to him. She’s off by herself. So I go to talk to her and say hello because I haven’t seen her in forever. She’s happy to see me and I'm happy to see her. We talk a little about the ceremony that just (...)",

We were all in outside buildings/ structures in our village; there were no doors or roofs. Everyone was tending things.

She came into the bed and everyone else did, too. We all cuddled and sang something I can’t remember. And she went off. When she came back she had blood for us to drink And told us we were free.

At first I make a nice batch of thin pancakes and distribute them as if I am feeding my own family, so I give two to each person and three to my husband. Then I look and realize there are so many more people to feed. I panic that they won’t be fed. I go back and cook another batch. I take a bite out of one, then soften the edge so it doesn’t look like it was bitten and I can give it away. I give one pancake to each person. Some people say no thank you. The people at the far end turn down the pancakes because they don’t trust these hippie kind of pancakes and others are watching their diets and don’t realize these are good for them. I make another batch and pass by my mother-in-law and my husband. She had been given two from the first batch and my husband was given three. I see that she has given her pancakes to my husband and he’s eating them, completely unaware that others are hungry. I hate it so much that they are totally unaware of other people’s needs. She could have given the extra pancakes away to the people who hadn’t had any food. He could have given his extra pancakes away instead of eating them all so quickly. I see that my brother-in-law is now trying to help in the kitchen. I’m annoyed by him, too, because he’s not being really helpful. I take another batch around. This batch is thicker. Some of the kids and their mom are helping to mix more batter. Their mom has poured the pancakes with a pan and used too much batter. I tell her to only use a spoon - she only needs a little bit for each pancake. Now there are really obese people. Some say no and some say yes to the pancakes. They feel the pancakes with goopy thick berry syrup. They’re so messy. When I go back to the kitchen area, it’s so messy. It’s not really a kitchen, just an area in the corner with a stovetop.

Fae is going through a process of some kind - she’s having a hard time and people are gathering to help her. The minister’s wife does some beautiful singing and healing with hands, whooshing away the worry, concern and pain. Then people gather closer to help, but Fae feels complete and most of the people go away. I stay. George is sitting at the table and speaking with Fae in the voice of our shadow work teacher. He’s helping her get clear on some things. He looks at me and talks with me in the same voice. Then we have to go. I have to go with my husband and we must leave quickly.

We were going to push it out of one of the upper rooms of the house so that we could have enough distance gliding to get the aircraft running. It was too big to push out of a window and we realized that we would have to destroy part of the wall to allow it to get out.  We were all packing and getting ready and I had to find a restroom. One had just been taken, so I ran downstairs to find another. Eventually I was ready.  I went back upstairs and looked out of the window. On the ledge was a large, thick black snake coiled up absorbing sunlight. It had flattened itself a bit to have a larger surface area. I wasn't quite sure what it was but was worried that it might be a cottonmouth. I poked it gingerly with a broom handle and it slithered inside toward me but veered off to my left and squeezed it's way into an outlet in the wall. I used the broom and poked holes through the wall to find the snake. I used the broom like an exacto knife and sliced away large sections of the wall but I couldn't find the snake.   We escaped and I found myself in a fancy restaurant with my brothers and Grandma O.. Before I even got to order, a chocolate raspberry was placed in front of me along with a watery milkshake with ice cubes in a small glass. I wondered if this was just an appetizer. I finished my milkshake quite quickly and it turned into ice water. Grandma O. noticed that my glass was the smallest and said that the waitress should give me a refill. I didn't think it was smaller.",

I go into see him because my body is hurting and aching and I feel terrible. I don’t have any energy and my body is falling apart. They start giving me medicines of some sort, but they don’t ask me if it’s okay and they don’t tell me what it is. I’m going along with it.

As I entered the hallway leading to the restroom, there was an explosion and in the distance I could see flames rushing toward me. I turned around and ran for it as the entire building behind me was engulfed in flames. I ran past many people, pushing past some and dodging others. I didn't have time to warn anyone or look for my mom. I eventually made it to a safe room where they sealed us in by lowering the many garage like doors. The room was dark and made of cement. 20 or so people were with me.  We could feel the heat from outside and I was worried that my mom was hurt. Eventually the fire was put out and we were all let out. The building was now the office warehouse and there wasn't much of a sign of a fire except soke slightly charred wood and boxes. J. D. came and told everyone that the fire was caused in the warehouse by someone plugging a phone into a line incorrectly and heating up the wire. This was a common mistake. They said that no one had died but that some had been injured. My mom wasn't there so I assumed that she had been taken to a hospital. I was nervous about asking but eventually went up to J. D. and asked him. He indicated that I should be quiet and not ruin the surprise. We all gathered in an open area with chairs where J. D. paraded out all of the people who we thought were injured. A mother was reunited with her daughter and I found my mom. I was happy but angry. J. D. had made everyone think their loved ones were hurt when they were fine, and all for the sake of making the company look good. He didn't see it that way nor did anyone else. The other mother asked, \"Can't you just be thankful that your mother is safe?\" No one got how messed up it was though I felt guilty for not being happier about my mom being okay.",

I’m going to a hotel with a small group of people for an educational high level training of some kind. I don’t recall who was there, except for Jeremy. Zoe is still alive, but she’s at their house and near her death. We arrive and are settling in. Somewhere around three o’clock, Jeremy gets a call from Zoe. She's distressed and feels very close to death. He, unusually, denies it and her because she’s been having similar experiences and it’s been more stressful and anxiety producing than real. So he hangs up the phone. I go into meditation. I see her in the courtyard outside their house - but it’s not their house in waking life. She’s dancing barefoot on the concrete ground. She gets really tired and turns off the music. She goes to the deck and lays her head down on the wooden deck and falls asleep for the last time. Somehow, we found out she has died. I know the exact moment because of my vision - it was in that three o’clock afternoon after, like 3:11pm. I gather my things to go with Jeremy over to the house. All the arrangements have been made by her friends. There are interactions in the hotel before we left, but I can’t recall them now. There’s a sense we will be spending the night together. We make the winding drive back along the coast to the house. When we arrive, her friends have laid her body out in the barn. Pema is there along with other friends who I’ve seen in passing.

They’re also gathering and writing poetry and preparing for guests. We go inside. People are sitting in rows. I sit by myself at the end of a row. I turn around and there are people looking at me.

He’s gathering them all up and getting rid of them. There’s also stuff that the tenants left on top of the fridge. There’s a box of baseball gloves and underneath that is a box of mittens and stuff.

It reminds me very much of eighties and nineties cookie cutter houses as they were built and decorated with walnut railings. I’m walking up the stairs and the carpet is white. I walk into the bathroom and the bathroom is also white. It’s gigantic! The floor is all white tile, the walls are white, there are multiple windows you can see out and there’s a shower with glass doors all the way around. I’m there with two other female bodies and a male body. The women are practicing massage on the male body. There’s a huge white plastic sheet on the floor so the oil doesn’t spill everywhere. The man is lying down. All three of them are friends. I’m not really a friend or part of the group; I’m just an observer, but they know I’m there. I’m talking and interacting and learning. I’m listening to the two women. One has short dark almost black hair like a page boy cut almost to her shoulders. She’s teaching the other girl. There’s an air of learning happening. Even though the male body lying on the ground is volunteering to get the massage, he’s also learning as the massage is happening. He has short curly brown hair. The other woman has longer dirty blonde hair. The women are talking about anatomy and how you rub this way. Interspersed in their conversation is a lot of personal stuff like, “I drank too much last night. What’s going on with your boyfriend and your family?” The guy has basically fallen asleep on the floor until the woman with dark hair gets to his calves. She’s massaging his left calf and she massages it in a way that wakes the guy up. He’s in a lot of pain. He wakes up and sits up and says, “What were you talking about just then when you were massaging the leg?” It seems to be significant to him that what they were talking about would cause pain in his calf while they were massaging it. Then the black-haired woman (...)",

It’s getting really late and it seems like I’ve been standing in line for a really long time. The line extends outside the bathroom doors and finally moves enough that I’m standing just inside. There are so many stalls and a few have open doors. When I peek in, I see women hovering their hands over the water, trying to cover what’s inside while waiting for the toilet to flush. I realize it’s taking so long because the toilets aren’t flushing properly. I step into a stall and squat and pee really fast then step out. A little while later, a woman goes into this stall and she’s disgusted because the seat is all wet. She steps out to get a towel to clean it up. I’m a bit ashamed, but I don’t think she knows I was the last person in that stall, and I also think it’s not pee, but rather splashback from a strong flush. Then we see another row of stalls - but it’s only changing rooms. Then somehow another row of stalls opens up and these have toilets. I’m trying to dressed for the event and realize it’s 11:30pm and my son is still awake! I give up trying to change because it’s just not working. I go find my family. They’re just playing, talking to people, laughing and having a good time. I’m surprised and think it’s maybe not as late as I thought it was. It’s only 6pm and we still have time to get my son home for bed. I’m relieved to see that my husband isn’t annoyed with me for taking so long. He seems understanding. The valet brings our car up. We get in the car to go to the house. The house is big, like the the ashram we visited recently in waking life. The people who live there aren’t around. We see a puppy in a big cage out front. The puppy is so cute - running around and happy. My son is especially excited to see it.",

I look in the mirror and do like what I see, but am concerned about how I’ll look when the makeup fades during the day and after I wash my face at night. Now, we are entering New York City through a portal. We are taken through a series of halls and rooms, peering in through glass windows. I am taken to a room with a large bed. The man who lives here is very wealthy and eccentric. He has strange sexual tastes and there is an understanding that we all must participate in some way to get out of here and continue on our journey. Now I'm in a basement or garage with a team. We need to find clues; each clue leads to the next. We’re doing well, but someone has tampered with the room and one of the clues in the sequence is missing. The floor is grey cement. There are shelves of books and odds and ends. There are other odd contraptions throughout the space. It’s dark with just a dim garage light. I’m now going to a performance in a theater. My husband and I don’t have tickets. When we arrive, they show us to our box seats. I see a friend from town and her husband. Their son is just a few days older than my son. We are taken to the seats front and center - very conspicuous. Now, I am in the portal rooms again. The man is in bed under the covers with at least three other people. I am standing at the side of the bed and ask him about the mattress composition. He says it’s made of wormwood. Interesting. There are beads of creamy substance in the seams. I pick them up and roll them into a ball and think it’s some kind of glue leaking through. I show it to him and ask him what it is. He pops it in his mouth, eats it and gives me a look.

It was the biggest castle at the end of a row of magnificent homes. I'm coming back there. I'm floating, skipping along, and it's at the end of the row. It has the name out front. The house is set way back, as it's on some acreage. Stately gardens and broad, park-like lawns. As I enter the grounds and go towards the house, there's a capped well, surrounded by a little plaza of pink stone, with a memorial stele. Then a long flight down of stone stairs, and a larger plaza, and finally the house itself. We are moving out. There were various people there, family and not. Mom is there. For the longest time, she's sitting in a plush, overstuffed chair near a wall. She laments that while we were out we had not gotten, and she named some kind of fancy cheese. I start looking around, and there are tables with cheeses set out, that people, I didn't know who they were, had provided. Because tourists would come and tour the place. So I go back to Mom and tell her about the cheeses, but I don't actually bring her any, not does she get out of her chair to investigate. Some wine, too. I notice that behind her is a big vertical sheet of plate glass that rises up maybe ten feet, and another piece that angles back toward the brick wall from the top of the first sheet. And it's wet. There's water running down it. There's an imperfection in the sheet of glass, and it's leaking. How water gets to it I have no idea, but water is coming out of it and draining down the front of the sheet of glass. There's a foreman, in charge of the moving or whatever, and it takes me some time to find him. He's in the basement. He's down there doing something. I find him and start to tell him about the seepage, and he's interested and concerned.

I was working on my unit but it was the future, I knew because the young social worker had a mustache and it was turning gray. He poked his head around the door and said, “we have more coming; we have to make room.” All of us, even the patients that could, made room for more beds. We lined the beds up so close to each other with no dividers and no rooms anymore, just beds next to each other and we turned the hallway into a unit. It was still the psych unit though. Some of my long stay patients were still there and one of them from a previous dream was in a wheelchair and these doctors came to see him but they hadn’t aged. They were like, “get up and walk,” and he did, but he was so tiny, like a little old man boy. He had stopped talking. There were mostly men on the unit, only a few women. One of the women was maybe a social worker from a place I used to work but she was getting admitted to our unit (not happening in real life) and she was angry, she was like, “you’re gonna have to make me walk through that door!” The security guard Arshis kept asking me if I was okay, something he’s been doing in real life lately because there has been a real threat to me on the unit. There was something unsafe outside like a war zone or something and we were living and working there. We were staying there forever and it was gray out of the widows, there was no sun, no day, no night. I wasn’t sad, I was working and working the milieu of patients like I always do and I belonged.

I’m a bit worried for myself, too, because I took some cash earlier to buy some food for myself. I’m trying to figure out how to replenish the cash and we are both trying to figure out where the woman has gone who took the purse. We don’t want to get involved with the authorities.

I’m doing the week’s worth of shopping with the meal plan and all that. I’m trying to plan to feed multiple mouths. I have the kids with me.

The house doesn’t look exactly like the house they used to live in, but I know it’s their house. I’m in it and I can feel the air has a different quality - it’s light and has particles in it, it’s as though I am standing in front of a window and can see light streaming in with particles floating in it. It’s so light and bright. The house is empty but it feels like there’s a presence in the light. Gradually Roberta and Tom appear. They look just like they did when I met them. Tom is busy with a project. He’s making something outside - he’s building something. Roberta is inside. She’s putting something together with her hands. One of her daughters appears and she’s laughing and joking. She’s, in a loving way, mocking what her mom is doing. Then they ask me if I would be involved with this project. I ask what it is that they’re doing. They say they’re creating hairstyles for people that are going to be on the television show. I realize that there’s a producer involved that’s giving some of the instructions, but I can’t see him and they’re just making reference to him. Roberta and Tom have a lot of autonomy. Someone is just doing the filming. I agree to do part of the hairstyles. They’re putting the styles together on paper first, but not as a drawing - it’s a standout relief like you’d make a sculpture - only they’re doing it with bits and pieces of things to create a finished product that is a hairstyle. There are all kinds of stuff woven into the hairstyles as if it’s been upcycled out of bits of ribbon, yarn and human hair. It’s colorful and unique in a way that I’ve never thought of before. It’s actually coming out more like a headdress which makes sense because they are Native North American.

Finally I say, you want me to call you this evening? He says yes. Outside, daytime, railroad tracks, a very long slope. A train goes down them, just an engine and a couple cars. It's coasting down the hill, a steeper slope than there would be in reality. I can see the tracks going down the slope for a considerable distance. I talk to some guy about how I love trains, and how the stretch from Sacramento to the pass through the Sierras is the biggest change in relief on the continent, for both road and rail. 7500 feet, and the trains for the fifty miles down to Sacramento can just coast. I'm a student, but my present age. One student, I'm a friend of his. He comes in late and sits at a table in the back of the room. I go to sit next to him. Something about some big drug deal. He had got crumbs of marijuana all over the table top, unintentionally. I point this out. One really big, very purple bud, purple hairs. He picks it up and tucks it away. Pot residue all over the table. I start scooping it up. I don't have anything to put it in, so put it in my shirt pocket. Flannel shirt, I think, this is going to be a mess. But at least it will stay put until I get home. I'm doing this in full view of everyone. This girl says to me, you know, marijuana can hurt your job prospects. I say, what do I need a job for?

It was a difficult experience as I had never gone fishing and the waters were rough and it was cold at night. And we had a spark and we made love and that scenario played out. We did our film project and it got chosen to move to the best next round and eventually we were chosen to make a feature film based on our short film.

He said that we got what we needed, we got the king salmon and the footage and we should go back now that I was awake. He didn’t comfort me. I said, “what happened to us?” and he said there never was an us?

The snake is a huge anaconda/boa constrictor and she lives under the outside shed that is raised just enough above the ground. We see little garter snakes eating acorns in their mouths. We see mice nibbling acorns. We see a white fuzzy frog with an acorn in her mouth. The anaconda/boa constrictor is out in the open, she’s coiled and folded up on herself. She usually leaves us alone and we leave her alone. A bobcat is sleeping on her. My mom and I have been close to this snake before. We step closer and see creatures sleeping in her folds - more mice and little frogs. I don’t know why, but I start poking the snake with my snow shovel. As I do this, the bobcat shifts slightly to the side, but continues to sleep. I see two baby snakes swaying their heads in the dark shadow beneath the bobcat and in the coils of their mama, the giant boa. She starts to move and unwind. We realize our mistake. The bobcat stretches and looks at us - she walks towards us. We realize we need to move fast. But my mom can’t move well because she has hurt her knee and ankle in waking life and she’s still recovering. I’m worried for her. We do get away. The bobcat and the big snake are both coming after us. My mom runs around the house. I run towards a high fence and scramble up it. I straddle the fence and see a ladder on the other side.

In the dream I don't understand why I have a new jacket or why this guy has taken such an interest in me, but it's all very agreeable, and I don't mind. Frank Melleins is very busy. there's something that needs to be presented to the organization hosting this event, or the facility in which it occurs. Some kind of record books or study that was done, research data, that is ceremonially bound in two leather bound books, quite slender. Much taller than they are wide, in very ornate cases. The cases are flattish, and look like very elaborate picture frames with these volumes in the centers, and a wooden cover that goes over the lot. I volunteer to take them, as it's in the same room. I just have to hand them over, making sure that they know what they are, not a big ceremony. There are also two ceremonial loaves of bread. One is good sandwich bread, sliced, whole grain, in a plastic bag. The othe (...)",

They’re following you.” It was like a lightbulb went on my brain: Oh, I’m being followed because of my light and tracked by these darker energies. It was almost like what you’d imagine if someone is being followed by spies or the CIA. At one point, I’m in my house and locking all the doors to make sure no one can get in. At a certain point, Tom Hanks is there and he’s following me. I’ve never dreamt of him before. He’s being creepy, but I’m being naive and nice, thinking he’s just nice. We must be at a hotel pool because I’m lying somewhere reading a book and relaxing. I realize I don’t do this a lot because I work so much. Tom Hanks is there and he’s really close to me. He comments on the book I’m reading: “Oh you’ve been reading that book for a while.” I say, “Yeah, you know, I’m just relaxing.” Later on I wonder how he knows I’ve been reading this book for a while? Then he starts to touch my neck I’m really weirded out and am like, “Stop, stop, stop.” It wakes me up. As I wake up, I make this really weird noise with my throat, like a choking guttural noise. I have a weird energy waking up from this dream and making that sound. There were other parts of the dream where I remember being in the rafters of a giant building and I’m hiding from these bad guys. I can fly between buildings.",

This time I’m in a flat that I rent with a bunch of other people. We’re in school again. My high school classmate Connie is one of my roommates in this apartment that I’m in. There are four other roommates and they’re all men and they’re really rowdy. It’s nighttime and also bedtime, so I’m trying to sleep. All of the beds are in the living room; it’s not like we have separate bedrooms to go to. The dudes are all wired, they’re totally super high energy. But I’m super tired and wanting to go to sleep. Connie is wanting to go to sleep. She’s kind of fussing over me, trying to make sure I’m okay. The guys are bouncing around the living room, fighting and wrestling with each other and getting kind of nasty and obnoxious and drinking. I’m trying to fall asleep on my bed. Even though it’s my apartment and my place of rest, I feel like a guest, especially with the way Connie is fussing over me and making sure I have all the things I need. She’s going out of her way to explain the other roommates’ behavior. They’re like, “Yeah, Rose, we see you, we see you’re sleeping, but we can’t help ourselves, so you’re just going to have to deal with it.” There’s an air of “tough shit.” I’m lying down and next to my bed is a screen that separates my bed from all the other beds. It’s a light colored pine wooden screen with slats. I get a phone call from James, one of my roommates from this dream. In real life James is a friend of a friend who I just went camping with. I like him a lot - he’s a very soft spoken person and in his day job he works with conflict resolution and has the biggest heart and is so kind. In the dream, he’s calling me to check up on me and make sure I’m okay with all the noise and violence. There’s an undercurrent of violence and threat of sexual harassment. I’m like, “Not really.

It’s a really odd combination of people. It’s like we just left somewhere, I don’t know where. We’re in an urban setting and we’re just walking. We’re walking in solitude. It’s a long walk. I can feel the fatigue in my legs. After a while, we get to someone’s house - it’s one of theirs, but I don’t know which one. We go in. it feels like it’s time to rest. My body says it’s time to rest, but no one is sleeping yet. Everyone is still awake. After some time of sitting on the couch, continuing not to say anything, my daughter’s boyfriend’s aunt wanders off and I assume she’s gone to sleep. I take this as permission to do the same. I wander around to find another room. I lie down on the bed on top of the covers. I’m almost asleep. The grade 8 teacher comes in and lies down on the covers as well. I feel she’s asleep, too. I wake up. It’s still dark and it’s still nighttime. Omar is beside me on the bed. I turn towards him and toss my arm and leg over him, so I’m hugging him as I sleep. I wake up. We’re still all there sleeping. I’m having a restless sleep. Then I just fall back to sleep. The next time I wake up, it’s morning and neither Omar nor the grade 8 teacher are awake yet. I just lie there for a little until I feel her stir. She doesn’t make any comment about Omar being there and I suddenly wonder if I’m the only one that can see him. She gets up and just fades away. I get up and I go into the kitchen. Debra is there, as are some other people. I start to wash the dishes - there’s a massive pile of them; they’re all over the kitchen counter. I reach for the plug. It’s really quite disgusting, the amount of soggy food bits as no one has emptied the plug or drain out for some time. So I have to dig around to find the plug and I’m scooping out bits of soggy food and putting it in the garbage. I wash a f (...)",

I drove to my next therapy appointment which was in a remote location off of a highway outside of town. It was in a large complex which I entered with some trepidation. There was a large open reception area with a marble floor. I approached the receptionist and was directed to the therapist, a tall, bald middle-aged man. I was suspicious of the place and the therapist from the start. During our session, he tried to convince me of a whole host of problems which I did not have. At first I was confused, but quickly figured out he was trying to trick me and convince me that I had to stay there long-term. I wasn't sure what their intentions were but they couldn't be good.  I disagreed about my problems but they insisted that I would have to stay there for some time. They took me to my room and had me lie down in my bed as they left and shut the door, leaving two guards stationed outside. As I lay down, I realized that I had been drugged as I was unable to move my legs. I determined that they had drugged me when they have given me something to drink and that the purpose of this drug was to prevent me from being able to walk and find a route of escape at night as the building was not that secure.  I decided to wait for nightfall and see if I could move at all. I found that the drug wasn't nearly as powerful as they had intended and I was able to move my legs and walk to some extent. I debated whether or not I should turn the light on in my room. I wasn't sure whether it would be better to escape in the dark in hopes that the guards would not see me or if I should turn on the lights so that I would better be able to find my way out of the room. In the end, I left the lights off and determined to be as quiet as possible.  I found that the window at the far end of the room could be opened. It was a tall, heavy white wooden window with square (...)",

He's holding a magazine which has an illustration of a knife, a line drawing, not even a very good one. I start thinking, why is he telling me this? He must spend a fair amount of time thinking about it, as he had it all right there. It spooked me. I thought, I don't want to be talking to him about this. I terminate the conversation. I say, you know what? I'm really not into this, and I don't want to be having this conversation. His response is befuddlement. Whaaat? It was all speculative in his mind, a thought exercise.

There are cement ramps that go down into the water that remind me of boat ramps, but it's part of a city under the water. I’m in the water with these babies. I’m holding or taking care of one of the babies. The parents are closeby. I’m with this baby and the whales swimming underneath us are coming up to support us under the water. There are other children swimming in the water with me and they’re really excited about the whales. I’m a tiny bit freaked out because whales are huge and I don’t want us to be accidentally drowned by them. I’m treading water and have this one baby. It has a life vest on and it’s parents are on one of the cement ramps. I’m treading water and one of the whales comes up and just its head comes out, so I can just see its mouth and eye. It’s talking to me. I’m not sure what it’s saying, but we’re having a conversation. We may not even be speaking out loud; it may just be mind to mind. I really wish I remembered what the conversation was about. Then the dream switches and I’m lying in my bed. I’m looking at this man and woman in front of me. They have twin boy children with them. I get the sense that I’m going to adopt these kids, so the adults that are with them are from the adoption agency. But I’m lying in bed like I’m not going to get up anytime soon. One of the twins crawls up on the bed and snuggles with me. I’m very calculatingly assessing these childrens. It’s a little unnerving because I’m deciding whether to keep them or not.

It looked like one of those old fashioned great big signs when you enter a town where it has the mayor’s face on it, then a story about the town. It was like a threshold or portal or lived experience rather than just a great big giant sign. It looked old, too, it had an oval shape to the story, the painted picture of the mayor was in the upper left hand side. I’m looking at a description, but it’s also an entry into a town. So it’s not two-dimensional. On the description is a comparison of a mayor and the lifestyle of someone involved in a subculture and has a motorcycle. The mayor is female. She looks like she’s had a life of outdoors - there’s a sun-kissed color to her skin. She has short blonde wavy and dense hair. She looks like she would be a muscular person even though the picture only has her face. The description is like a political analysis of someone who is mayor of a town and removed from that duty that caters to the idea of mayor but stays in the office and doesn’t really interact - maybe like how clueless the aristocracy was to the plight of the common people. So it’s a comparison between mayoral duties that are detached and removed from what people need as opposed to someone who is more rebellious of that polite culture, rides a motorcycle, but is simultaneously responsive to the needs of the town and then is praised. But the praise is lie: despite the fact that there is a motorcycle, there is a number of positive qualities that the mayor has. It’s not two-dimensional in that I’m reading this. I’m feeling it as a lived experience in my body when these two descriptions are compared and contrasted. It’s like an entryway into that experience. I consider them from how my body feels about them, then decide that I would rather live in a place with a mayor that rides a motorcycle and is somewhat rebellious but responsive, than the mayor that caters to polite society but is cluelessly privile (...)",

I dive after him and see his body hit the cement bottom. I see all the air forced out of his body and his body goes limp. I reach for him to bring him up to the surface. It’s awful.",

The bus gets to the district, and I get off, because I have to transfer. After I get off, I think I should have checked. That might have been a downtown bus. Very vivid. There are a lot of pedestrians, and I remark that no one is wearing a face mask. I begin to feel uncomfortable, but then realize that I am dreaming and it doesn't matter. Lucid. The bus that I was on came west on 12th and turned left at Pithy Way, which was one way northbound except for busses. The bus way was also the sidewalk, however, and now I am walking down the sidewalk and the bus is right behind me, and then is ahead of me, and I lose track of it. I'm walking to where I can catch a downtown bus. I'm driving my car, my real car, going west on Yolto. Centerville is a bigger, older city than in reality. A lot of low-rise, 19th century buildings with various types of ornamentation. Fully lucid. I'm fascinated, taking it all in, very pleased to be dreaming, as it had been a long, sleepless night. I get to where I think I will get a good view of downtown, but instead there's an extensive bay and more residential. The bay looks like the edge of the ocean. There's a peninsula jutting westwards to my left, but it's not West Centerville. Very big bay, very blue. Cloudy, daytime, as I was driving. Everything very real, the engine noise, shifting of gears, etc. A part where I'm sleeping in some young woman's room. There was something that led up to this. I feel her tap on my foot. My foot's under the covers. It feels completely real, so much so that it half wakes me up, and I'm caught between the dream and waking. Right on the top of my foot, just back of the toes, like it was time for me to get up.",

It was a big room with 4 bunk beds and a bathroom and a big recreation area. Everyone was nice. They wouldn’t let me have my phone though and I was freaking out because I wanted to call someone familiar. I had a panic attack and fell over to the ground and froze up - couldn’t move, couldn’t talk. After a few minutes I could move but still not talk. They didn’t believe me - thought I was making it up even though I wasn’t speaking correctly. I asked to go to the hospital but they wouldn’t take me. I couldn’t talk for a long time. Fast forward a few years and I had a boyfriend and was close with my new sisters. We went to a museum and there was a reptile exhibit. I saw a giant rattlesnake and was super drawn to it. It was shaped like a square instead of a round body. Was very weird. The cage was slightly open. When everyone left the room I wanted to pet it. When I did, it latched on and bit the shit out of me, I ripped it off and it bit me again and again on each hand and foot. It was really painful. I ran out and told everyone I’d gotten bit and needed an antivenom. I wasn't panicked or scared, mostly ashamed. My mom gave me an address of a doctor nearby the house who had some antivenom. We all went but only I got out of the car. When I went in, it was like a circus/bazaar. Super colorful and loud and mystical. Someone helped me right away with all the wounds and asked about my two spirits. After I was treated I felt better and the band of Gypsies who were Aida and Aharon and others who invited us to join their party and they had a hot spring we soaked in and aerial performances and things. It was like a door to another dimension.",

I think I’ve dreamt about them before running. This dream was both flashing back to the work on something that looked like present day and then flashing to a memory reel, some of it like old pictures. The current flash was this embodied sense of hard work - we were working with a group of people on these box cars to outfit them for something; there was conflict and confusion amongst us but out in the world there was war. We had to work stealth and fast, always at night and these boxcars had to be undetected. The flash to the scenes with the daughter haunt me. I can almost hear her voice and she’s talking about going to New York City and riding around in the backs of trucks and the image is the mother and daughter in a black and white picture in the back of an old truck holding onto a mattress and the narrator is talking about letting her daughter decide where to go and zooming in on the daughter’s face smiling but it’s sad and creepy feeling like something bad happened to the daughter and it just made me want to turn my light on as I write this.

As I’m trying to juggle all these different piles of things, I now become the first person in line and it’s my turn. I still can’t find my bank card. I say to the couple behind me - a man and a woman who appear to know each other and have been chatting happily the whole time - “I need to set my stuff down on the floor. I can’t find my bank card. I know it’s here. Feel free to go ahead.” They do and I can still hear them chatting happily with each other. I’ve spread everything out on the floor and sort through them. I’ve got envelopes opened with bills I’ve looked at and returned. There are things from my son’s birthday party. There are gift cards for McDonald’s that I know we’ll never use because we don’t eat there, but we can deposit them into our bank account. I finally locate my bank card. Every time I thought I located my bank card, I would look at it and it was a replica of a bank card but wasn’t a bank card. It keeps getting into the pile of things to deposit into the ATM by accident because it looks so much like a bank card but it’s not one. Although when I’m finally read to make my deposit, the couple that was chatting happily has gone and there are different people who are ready to have their turn.

The house is very rambling and ramshackle, and once we get there, I see very little of Friedrich, who disappears for a while. Some really lovely, charming rooms, but also a lot of bric a brac and deteriorated, junky stuff. Piles of laundry people keep meaning to sort but never get around to, misinformation on packets of bills. Etc. Junky, not kept up, not swept, not cleaned. It's morning. I go out to my car to get something or put something in it, and my car is gone. I see the exterior of the house, which is rather maze-like, and has several garages. I look for my car but it is not there. I finally find Friedrich. He's still asleep, but he wakes up and asks me if I've tried this certain marijuana, and pulls out this bag that has over an ounce in it, quite dark green, darker than real marijuana. He gets up, and gives me some information but doesn't help me look for my car. He's quite comfortable staying there, where there are friends of his. I never get around to reporting the car as stolen. The dream ends before I get out of the house or find my car. Friedrich and I had had some very interesting plans to drive a long ways, see some native villages on the Bering Sea or Arctic Ocean.",

There are shops across the street from the university - your typical coffee shop and bagel shop and all the things that college students eat. It’s not as dark as previous dreams, but there are clouds and it’s a little grey, raining and drizzly. I’m going in and out of groups and shops. I’m not with anyone or part of any group. I keep seeing people I know. I wander into someplace - I can't tell if it’s a shop or someone’s home. There are a bunch of people sitting at a long dining table eating. I talk with them for a bit. It could have been a restaurant, but I’m not sure. I leave and walk out. I’m walking downhill on this cobblestone street. I’m walking on the sidewalk and passing by some shops. I see some people who remind me of the manager at the grocery store and her kids and partner. I’m hovering - I’m there but not - and have a sense that I want to be invited, but they don’t see me. They’re coming out of a shop onto this sidewalk. I don’t know why I’m standing there, but I’m waiting to engage or be engaged by them, but they’re not seeing me. It’s almost like I’m a ghost. I finish walking down this street. At the end of the street is water and a pier. I don’t know if it’s a lake or the ocean. There’s also a wine and cheese food truck. I walk down to it. It’s all outdoors. As I’m walking into the courtyard I see the area with the cheese. The cheeses are all stacked on each other and the names are written on a piece of plywood. You can reach into cubby holes and grab out a piece of cheese. The cheese has to be cold, so I guess this is a wood front to the cooler. I’m looking at this and talking to someone - the dairy freezer manager from the grocery store.

There are lockers lining the hallways. It’s the expanded version of high school but doesn’t look like the one I went to - it just represents high school. In one of the rooms, there are four large round tables, but they’re really low to the floor like you’d see in a daycare. There are chairs around the tables. There’s a bathtub with a shower curtain pulled across it on one side. Across the hall from this room - and the hall is lined with lockers - is a doorway that leads into my apartment. All I see of my apartment is just the one room you enter. So as you open the door, it goes into a living area. There is some living room furniture like a couch and a couple other chairs for single people, some end tables and lamps. There’s a closet with a cheap sliding door where coats are hung. It does look like there’s a kitchen off to the right although I do not enter it in my dream. In my dream I leave my apartment, walk across the hall and see that people are starting to gather around the tables. I see a couple friends from high school. I’m still friends with one of them even though she’s moved quite a distance away. It doesn’t feel like it’s been a long time because we do message on Facebook. She stands up and I give her a hug. Then we both sit down at the table. I’m having trouble fitting my adult size body under the table - my knees don’t fit under because the table and chairs are so low.

The pages are slightly glossy and yellowing. It had some sheet music, some poetry, and a lot of text. In the dream the subject matter was clear, but forgotten now. The book had belonged to Patricia.

It looks kind of tropical but also like California, desert with a lot of oak trees.

She looks at me as if I were the one who was supposed to teach. I look at the schedule and see that I’m to teach a yoga class. I find a former high school classmate, Fiona, to co-teach with me. She’s a bit surprised because she is a new teacher, but agrees. She gets the music together and begins the class. Then I step in. My voice is too quiet and I can’t get my volume up to fill this big room. Mats are scattered in disarray and people are clustered close together.

We are aware that there is a church nearby and lots of people have given us good feedback on it and we know that the group that goes there is really involved in a lot of things in the community. So even though church has not been something that we’ve had favorable ideas about in the past, we decide to give it a try. It’s Sunday. We walk to the church. The church is enormous. It’s beautiful. It’s built of stone; it looks like hand-hewn rock. It rises really high up into the sky. On the front of it, there is a really large stained glass window in the shape of a rose. There are spires around the outside of it that also rise straight up. The doors are all hewn wood. The wood is so thick and the doors are bigger than normal. This is what you see from the outside. The church probably takes up a whole block. The doors are open. People are starting to file in. The faces aref friendly. There is such a multicultural, multi demographic of people of gender and age and they just reflect such a wide variety of life. My daughter and I look at each other; we smile, but we don’t say anything. We’re thinking, “Yep, this is going to be good.” We go in. There’s an older woman who is taking people’s names. She’s asking questions about our interest. She notes these on a clipboard then directs us to go upstairs. She also tells which room to go to when the service is over. She is clumping people by interest. We walk up a really wide staircase - it’s probably three staircases wide - and it creaks under my feet. The creaking is like an orchestra because there are a lot of people and as each person’s foot lands on the stairs, the stairs make a creak. So it’s a symphony of creaks. The staircase winds around.

Somehow I know that Liam is there. I have a flash of having seen him earlier in the morning. Now it’s getting towards evening. I am with another person - sometimes the person is a woman and sometimes the person is a man. We meet up with Liam in the hallway of the hotel. He wants to take us to his rooms and show us where he’s been staying. It’s not so easy to get to his rooms. He takes us down the hallway, down a back set of stairs, and across another hallway. We’re on the floor just below the ground where the windows are just above the ground. We come to his rooms, but we can’t enter from the hallway. So we have to go through the brothers’ room next door. This room is where five men are staying. He knocks on the door and we walk through. The men are all hanging around on couches watching a show, probably a sports show. One man has a girlfriend and she’s watching me as if I don’t belong. We pass through a door and down a short hallway to Liam’s room. He opens the door and there’s a naked woman wrapped up in a white sheet as if she’s just been ravished in the morning and sleeping all day. At first I think it’s his wife and am thinking I should leave. But then she rolls over. She’s a very tiny Asian woman. I guess they’ve been practicing tantric sex secrets and she has a book. There’s an invitation for all of us to be together. She instructs us. We all look at each othe (...)",

Ana is asking me about getting things right in general. I’m looking at her like, “I don’t know. We’re just kind of winging it.” I wish I could remember more, but there’s the feeling between us where Ana is feeling a little bit of despair. We never leave the shower. But Ana ends up in a place of acceptance that the work she is doing is indeed and in fact good enough and we can only do the best we can do. Then the scene changes. I’m with my siblings. We’re all in a big house together and it’s all of them - my five brothers and my sister - and my mom and dad. We’re just living life. At one point there are all these blueberries on the kitchen table to be eaten. The kitchen table is a long table that sits about twelve and it’s just covered in blueberries. We’re munching on them. We’re all coming and going. At one point we all pile into a van. My brother is going to drive. This annoys me because I get carsick with the way he drives - he’s not a very smooth driver. So I’m not excited to be a passenger in the car with him. But he’s so fucking stubborn about being the one to drive that it’s not worth arguing, so we all just let him drive all the time. Then the scene changes again. We’re in a house of some sort but I don’t recognize it and I don’t know who it belongs to. There are other people here and we’re all gathered for a wedding. I’m talking to the parents of the bride or groom. The dad looks like an actor - white dude, older - and he’s making popcorn. He pours the popcorn in the popcorn maker but there’s no bowl and I’m saying, “Hey you might want to get a bowl and you might want to get it real, real quick because your popcorn is about to pop.” The popcorn starts popping and it’s endless. I’m standing there and trying to make a bowl with my arms to try to contain the popcorn. Of course it’s going everywhere. It wouldn’t normally be that (...)",

I was trying to get in the smaller of the two spaces that I work in. Two of my coworkers open the door. They were cleaning it and there was graffiti all over the walls and somebody had broken in and written all over the walls. I’m trying to review what it looks like but the writing was blue and purple I think it says something like “jeer.” And then I went to the other room with my coworker and there were people cleaning the room. We said hello and tried to jump on a phone call. The computer didn’t work so we were trying to use our phones and I felt like we were early but we were not and when we finally got on, the Meeting was ending. Then I walked back to the smaller office and realized there was a fence around the door. He turned around and one of the patients that should’ve been on the locked side was loose on my unlocked voluntary unit side. He was slamming and checking me against the fence and very physical. Security came and instead of taking him away, they kept body checking him over into the fence where I was against the fence and then eventually throwing him over on top of me. And when I walked out I suddenly didn’t have shoes on and I saw the security person from far away - not the one who was just body checking the guy against the fence but a different one. He didn’t help me but he looked concerned that he was pretty far away so I started walking towards the building where they were. I was confused and scared and felt exposed.",

I'd put some stuff of mine down, and there was some stuff already there. As I leaf through it, towards the back it had gotten food on it, and it's a little greasy and discolored. I think I might have caused it. I say something about it, forget the reaction. I go out of that room. I think I should say goodbye to the group I had been sitting with, but no one seems to care whether I'm there or not. I think. One really big guy. He's 7.5 or 8 feet tall. In the dream I knew exactly who he was, and what his position was. He has taken a fancy to me. In the dream I'm much younger, and not overweight. My head barely comes up to his mid-chest. He picks me up and gives me a squeeze. He wants me to go back to his place with him. I consent, but I want to establish some boundaries. I say, my goal is to get to know what looks like a very awesome guy. But I feel wary, and am worried that he just wants to have sex. He doesn't disagree with that, but, again, I am afraid he just has sex on his mind. To get to his place we go down a path, metal pipe railings, concrete, a few switchbacks through this garden. His place is some kind of modern condo, boxy, minimalist. I don't go inside, because I'd left my stuff somewhere else, and I need to go back and get it. I try to establish with him just where it is. Four blocks down the hill, he says, but don't count the lanes. He wants to call them alleys, but we're in Canada. He thinks lanes is an Americanism. I try to tell him he's got it backwards. He's a little puzzled but accepts it. On leaving I try to give him my phone number. I have great difficulty remembering it, but finally manage it. Quite early in the dream, a long walk with another guy. I encounter him, we go for this walk. He's very pleasant, but after we've walked for a while, he wants to go home, does go home. Ta (...)",

It goes barreling through the station at speed. As we get towards the far end of the station, there are people on the tracks, and the train does slow down to avoid hitting them. The people take their time getting out of the way. We get right down to the end, and there's a woman lying on the tracks, covered by a blanket, and the train does hit her and kills her. There're some people around the tracks who look on with horror. This causes a major delay, of course, but eventually the train continues on. A part where there's no tracks. Big hills or mountains. Then somehow I'm off the train. The train is delayed. It's behind me somewhere. The tracks have disappeared, covered by landslides. Then I'm on the train again? There's no tracks, but the train continues anyways, cutting through the parking lot of some big mall somewhere in northern California. Then I'm off the train again, waiting for it to catch up. I'm with another person. We go to some kind of weird, kind of Asian fast food place. We ask someone there if the train had gone by yet, and she said it was going to come through at 2:30. My companion says, that's very late. The place is giving away whatever their most popular item is. I order one. A little Filipino or Vietnamese guy behind the counter. When it comes, it's a very uninspiring little, grey, lumpy meat patty, looking more like fried oatmeal than anything. Fairly crowded in there, and I think, this isn't safe, thinking of the pandemic. I've hop a freight back to Centerville. It arrives, and I steal a box of whatever this thing was transporting. The box is maybe 14 x 22 x 12 inches. When I look inside, it turned out to be fruit picker's baskets. I leave them in this warehouse. I have an encounter with some train officials, may have been the engineer and such.

I’m observing all of this and don’t feel like I’m in this part of the dream. So these two women riding these motorcycles are pretty fucking badass and I’m just watching them. They’re going pretty fast. There’s a dude in this three-wheeler behind them. He’s kind of reckless and pushing him from behind. They’re weaving in and out of cars and traffic. The feeling of it is really dangerous. There aren’t a lot of cars. The road itself is going through wheat fields and forest on the other side of the road. The terrain keeps changing as everyone is speeding through this. There’s also a bus behind that’s kind of following. I’m going back and forth between hovering over the motorcycles watching and being in the bus and talking to the bus driver. I’m watching these motorcycles and at one point I see the guy in the three-wheeler veer off into a wheat field and destroy a bunch of the wheat. Then he comes back onto the road and is still behind these women. The feeling of this part is really intense - the sounds of the motorcycles are really loud in my ear. The wheels of the motorcycles and the three-wheeler are cartoonishly big. There are other passengers in the bus. The inside of the bus is like a school bus, the way the seats are set up, but the outside of the bus doesn’t look like a school bus. I don’t know who the bus driver is - it’s not somebody I recognize. He has a wise demeanor about him - he has the feeling of being a guide in this dream. I’m watching and then the scene cuts away into some sort of night club or bar. I’m leaning against a bar and talking to these two men whose eyes are a light piercing blue with a light behind them. There’s definitely flirting going on between us. There’s a mirror behind the bartender where all the alcohol is sitting on shelves. It’s dim inside. I know that the people on the mo (...)",

Everyone was milling about talking, eating or watching TV. I was a bit tired and went into a backroom with some comfortable chairs and attempted to doze off. Jared and some others came in and sat down. They thought that I was asleep and spoke jokingly about the state of consciousness that one enters as one is drifting off to sleep. I said something humorous indicating that I wasn't asleep.  Later that afternoon, everyone was gathered and told that we would have to play volleyball. There was some debate as so whether his instruction would allow those who weren't any good at the game to do something else. I stood with the group of guys watching the game, but was bored and anxious about having to play so I decided that I would instead go out and swim to the rock in the middle of the lake.

One would be repaired the next day, but the other would take a week and a half. My superior is based on Paul Thompson. He was supportive and very familiar to me. But there was some screw-up. The class meets in a big grocery store parking lot. The lot is not entirely flat. I'm looking for the right place. I guess it's this lot. Everyone is supposed to drive there. I get there and there are maybe half a dozen students, all boys, out of about thirty. They have a remote controlled toy car that they are playing with. I park my car a few rows away, so as not to be in the way. The row of parking places I put my car in is elevated above the rest of the lot, maybe ten or fifteen feet up. I go down there, and more people have arrived. The Paul Thompson character wants the AV cart to be there, in this parking lot. I'm dubious. There's no power. He makes some snarky remark. I reply that I had got the cart repaired, so I had done something, and I head back to my car to get it, but as I walk I realize that the cart is not in my car. It's at the school, and by the time I go and get it and come back, class would be over. A row or aisle, back in the school, where there are all these, oblate, not spherical, sort of like glass beads, light lavender, light blue, white, a great many of them piled high right at the angle of repose. As I walk down the aisle I push them back with my hands. There are also a lot of them spread across the floor. I'm talking to somebody. It's morning, students are filing in. The room is a warren of aisles, but you can see over the dividers. More and more students come until it is very crowded. I was talking again to the Paul character, but someone else comes in and takes over the conversation until I am just standing there not talking.",

My apartment was only really a living room--or that is the only part of it we saw--and was fully furnished. While there was a couch and coffee table, primarily, the room was filled with televisions. There were flat screens and old CRT screens, some large, some small. I walked around the room and counted a total of 11 of them. At this point, I believe Jared showed up and we were thinking that this was strange.  The dream was a bit dark and depressing and I had the feeling that I shouldn't be living by myself.",

She almost splashes in the water, but ends up crashing down on the shore which is a bunch of wooden planks that are wet with water because the tide is going out.

We saw that after the earthquake in the 1800s (which in my dream I think I related to as big as the 1906 in San Francisco) they decided not to fix the underground area because it was all working. We followed the cracks on the floor and then realized there were less cracks on the other side of the room, and somehow this was significant. The imagery was of a big steel ship/boat with dark deep blue paint. Also in part of this dream I was having dinner with my dad by the water’s edge - by this lock system - and I had just finished eating with my sisters when he came late. I left them to eat together.

He's got blue jeans that are frayed and worn, and a white ish or cream colored shirt with thin red lines that cross, forming boxes of about 2\" square. He's ever so slightly disheveled, but overall not bad looking at all. I check him out. Suddenly, he asks me, \"Are you a construction worker?\" I say no, and he then says, \"Your breath really smells like a construction worker's.\" I'm puzzled and a little nonplussed by this, and speed up and ride away.

There’s absolutely no judgment from her, but for me I feel a combination of comfort with her and a strong charge of desire and comfort in playing with him, especially when our hands occasionally touch. I have a wallet. I need to pay for something - my portion of a rent or dues as part of a big group. I take my wallet out to pay.

I’m told that this shopkeeper knows exactly what I need. I consult with her and choose one. I panic when I try to pay and can’t find my wallet. Ted goes to look for it.

The child had Down Syndrome. We were showing up at the dentist and we had to give her these pills. We gave her the first set of pills and we were sitting there waiting for them to take hold. The dentist was busy in the other room. When I went in there, they were having a breakfast meeting. We were sitting there and my daughter was on drugs for this appointment. They wanted us to give her two pills every 10-15 minutes. So they were having us give her more and more, but they weren’t even doing anything with her. I was getting really annoyed. At a certain point, I looked at this child who doesn’t even look like my daughter and they were grinding their jaw like someone on ecstasy. The child was doing this. I was getting really frustrated. The child looked like they had too many drugs in their system, but they kept asking us to give them more. Then I went in to talk to the dentist: “Why are you not doing the procedure? She’s ready to go.” They were having breakfast and I was really annoyed and the appointment was dragging on longer. There was also a guy in there and he was an astrologer. He had slides up about the Venus cycle. They were actually really cool and I said, “Wow that’s really interesting, I want to get your book.” Then I realize that Uranus is square my Venus tonight and I was like, “Huh, I wonder if it’s all about meeting this guy and that was some random side note.” Before we got to the dentist, there were other things going on and images. One was a family washing their clothes in a puddle of water on the side of the street in New York City. it was clean water - it was not gross looking. But I was like, “Oh my god, this poor family.”",

The windows, although they’re big, don’t seem to transmit an awful lot of light, so that casts a little bit of a shadowy effect over everything in the house. I’m aware that there is a floor above me, but I don't go into it in my dream. The ceilings are really high. The windows are deep and wide. It feels like mid-eighteenth century architecture of someone who would have had enough money to build a fair-sized house. I guess you would call the parlor, because it’s off the kitchen, has a big archway that goes into the sitting room. I can see the sitting room and kitchen from the parlor, but I stay in the parlor which has a big couch with deep cushions in it and a turkish rug that’s woven and quite colorful in muted tones. There’s electronic equipment against one of the walls. I’m there because I’m supposed to be recording some kind of radio show. In order to add my segment, I have to walk over to the electronic equipment - it’s got dials on it - and I’m moving the dials around watching the needle on the screen move up and down as I turn the dial.

You can't see any ties, just the old rails amid grass and weeds. Not well maintained. The guy operating the car is pretty busy. There's a lot for him to do. The car just moves. There is no wire for it to be electric, and no engine noise as from gas or diesel. Frequently I see disused tracks joining and leaving this one. Apparently the network was once much more extensive. I talk to the operator about all this. He's very cool. I'm on my way home. We get to some little, final station, after going up a steep hill and through the woods, and I get out. Problem: my luggage is lost. I had three pieces of luggage, my laptop, a big suitcase, and an oversized valise. No sign of any of it. I look and look until a couple hours later another car arrives. There's a little inn or hotel next to the station, and I look there also. The staff in the station are pleasant but not actually helpful. Someone on the staff is a paternal cousin of mine, but I didn't know her. She's more helpful than the others, but can't find my luggage. She says they could search the other trains that had been and gone, in case my luggage had been mistakenly sent on, but she wasn't hopeful that was the case. There was some stratagem or location... I'm shown some lost luggage that they think might be mine, but it isn't. I go back to the original line. I've looked everywhere in the station and the inn repeatedly and nothing.

I think there is the man who did my daughter’s tattoo. I feel like my stepmother is in there, as well. The point of everybody being there is to draw a mural. It’s not clear what the subject of the mural is supposed to look like. One person starts off drawing in black with paint and a paintbrush what looks to be a fish. But then somebody comments, “No that’s not right. That’s not what it looks like,” and then adjusts it - makes the torso/belly area a little thinner and makes it even thinner as it goes back towards the tail. Then someone else says, “Mmm, that’s closer, but it still doesn’t look right.” Then someone else takes the paintbrush and begins to draw legs on it. Now it’s starting to look more like an insect with somewhat of a fish face. There’s a consensus that yes, that’s much closer to what it resembled. Then my daughter gets in there and removes part of it and adds what I think is much more accurate in terms of the legs and ribcage. Then I fall asleep for a little while, maybe just five minutes. I don’t think anyone noticed I was sleeping. When I woke up, it’s stunning. I’m thinking that it’s exactly what it looks like and it’s even got more details.

At the same time Richard Baker has also come to visit me. It's a coincidence that they are here at the same time. We're walking together down near, but not in, the Centerville Center. It's very early in the morning, 5:30 or 6 AM. There's something major going on at the Center. We see amazing rides inside the Center. I tell Richard and this girl that you couldn't pay me to go on them. In one, two pods full of people are thrown skyward, hundreds of feet up, doing multiple somersaults in free fall before coming to rest. Another morphs through several forms but all are terrifying. A skyscraper bends in the middle and folds over. I don't even remember. Then we're walking through a marina. But prior to that, I'm driving a pedal car at the south end of the Lake. Not as in reality, but close. We're going up a hill to get a view, but it's a lot of work pedaling. We decide to go home first and have breakfast and think about how to do it in a way that is less difficult. We're walking through this marina, and I try to figure out where it is, and decide it's on an extension of south Lake Union. I lose track, first of the girl, and then of Richard. The girl eventually reemerges, but I never find Richard again. All his stuff is in my car. I marvel at how her parents permitted her to travel across the ocean and spend time with an older man who is a stranger to them. I hadn't invited her; she just showed up. We can't find Richard. We look in several places, but progress is slow. I figure that he was displeased not to have my full attention. The girl is waiting to give some presentation. We're now inside the Center, and there is a line of people waiting to give presentations having to do with swimming in their home country. I don't know what she is going to talk about. She confides to me that she can barely swim, not goo (...)",

There are three animals - not any animals I’ve seen in this world. They have the body of a giraffe, but are striped like zebras and have a little tuft of fur on top of their heads that’s bright green or bright pink. They kind of remind me of horses, but kind of not. They’re in front of me and I’m walking down a hill. They start running and I start running. I notice it’s really easy to run because it’s downhill. Even though they’re running at a pace that an animal with four legs can run, which is way faster than us usually, I’m keeping up just fine. As they’re running, I’m behind them and then I think I’m herding them, but then at one point, they’re actually herding me. They stop running at one house. They start to mill in front of it. They herd me away from the house. As I run past the house, I see a gigantic alligator in the front yard and they’re putting their bodies between me and it, so they’re protecting me from it. These animals are different sizes, so it’s clearly male, female and baby. I’m so shocked and concerned because they have the baby kind of close to the alligator and I don’t want it to get eaten. Then I keep running a bit and they slowly disappear out of the dream. All of this has been downhill - at no point did it flatten out - so I’ve been running downhill this whole time. Then I get to the top of the stairs. All around the stairs is the body of a snake and I can’t find its tail and I can’t find its head. It’s huge, huge, like I couldn’t reach my arms around the body of it. And it’s long. I’m at the top of these stairs and these stairs are eight flights high and I’m walking down. I’m a little bit nervous because of the body of the snake and I don’t know where its head or tail is. Its shed snakeskin is right next to it. It’s wrapped around the railing of these stairs that are all concrete. I was just rubbing through suburbia (...)",

I returned to the same room with the turtlenecks but I was someone else again or a different time period, but the same person. I had cowboy boots. They looked similar to mine in real life. They were sitting outside the door, and I was going to have to leave them there to go inside the wooden door and do something (maybe it was a spa) and there was a pair of small black rain boots as well. I was inside either a cabin or a temple or spa. There were signs of people but I didn’t see anyone. I was feeling an urgency to make a decision and leave.",

A nurse is sitting at a desk and we line up in front of her. I’m about in the middle of the line. The nurse is spraying a vaccine mist for SARS-CoV-2 in front of each person’s nose and requiring them to sniff deeply to bring it in. She does not explain what it is or how it works. I comply the first time because it does not seem too harmful for my body, but I try not to breathe it in deeply. But the next time around, she takes out a long thin needle connected to a vat of the vaccine. When it’s my turn, I say no. I am firm but non-violent in my resistance. She has been prepared for this scenario. So instead of poking me with the needle, she pushes a stronger dose of the nasal mist up into my nostrils. I can’t breathe through my right nostril at first, but she continues to be steady and persistent in her administration of the proper dose. I do eventually take it in. i am allowed to go home. I stop at a doctor’s office for some reason. I see another mother from town. There’s some kind of dance with distancing and gauging whether it’s okay now to be near each other, talk or communicate in any way. I go home, but it’s not really my home. I’m in a room on the third floor. People are gathered downstairs in the courtyard, drinking and eating. I stand at the window watching. A foreign man sees me. He saw me at the doctor’s office, too, and was attracted to me. I’m not sure whether to be afraid of him or not. I step back from the window, stand naked at the end of the bed and fall backwards. Somehow he sees me do this through the window. I stay in my room lying on my back, scanning my body for any harmful effects from the spray. I want my husband to come home soon. He does, but only briefly. He has to go somewhere. I offer to drive him because I don’t want to be left alone in case something bad happens t (...)",

A scene where they bind his hands in front of him with some kind of cord. He's cooperative, which I didn't think he would be. He's fairly unconcerned. Before long, the binding is quite loose and coming undone. We remark that it must be scratchy—it's some kind of natural fiber, like sisal. The cord is small in diameter. Eventually they put him in a van and take him away. A child of one or one and a half, male, smaller than a real child of that age would be. The size of a newborn, but able to walk, and aware of its surroundings in ways a newborn isn't, and having much more control of its body. Somehow this child is my responsibility now. Much forgotten. I end up in some room with this child, and have it overnight. I'm in this room with other people who eventually are helpful. By the morning some woman comes from the school, who is going to collect the child. At that point I'm lying down because I'm exhausted, and someone else is holding the baby, who has been quite well taken care of. The woman comes in and looks around and doesn't see me at first. She sees someone else with it and assumes I abandoned it. I sit up and point out that she is wrong. I had organized a team.

I was like, “Oh my god, it needs to be with its mother!” So I dove into the pool. I was swimming all over and all around and the pool was fifty or a hundred feet. I was going to the very bottom. I was seeing all kinds of other things. I saw my Bun-bun which is my bunny that was given to me when I was born and I still have it. I was like, “Oh, there’s Bun-bun!” Clearly it was a deep dream of my psyche and what’s down at the bottom and memories of childhood. But I kept looking for the baby piece that needed to be with the mommy piece. At a certain point I was looking underneath chairs and I was having other people help me.

At one point, I’m not paying attention and totally cross the center line and almost nail an oncoming car. My mom was freaking out in the passenger seat, as she should. I get back in my lane and we make our first stop at this house of a friend of mine and my ex’s relatives. This house is kind of cool. It’s a bunch of millennials and their focus is on social justice. They all share the house. They do lots of things together. Everything is focused on quality conversation and connection and conflict resolution, which when you live with a bunch of roommates is probably a good idea! They really go out of their way to connect. They play games to connect. They welcome us into the house and show us our bedrooms and everything. They invite us to play one of their games. I kind of lose track of my mom at this point. I think she’s there, but I’m not totally sure; she just kind of fades into the background. The young woman who is the person I know has dark curly hair down to her shoulders, Latina, shares a room with another woman who is her girlfriend. There are two or three men that all share a room. One man is gay. There’s only one white man in the entire house. It’s so interesting. I’m noticing all of this. They’re starting to play a game and the game is hard to explain - they are explaining to me a set of rules. There’s an activity for us to do and we all do the activity in our own way. At one point this activity takes us all out of the house. I find myself in a mall then back in the front yard of the house. At one point, there is a little bit of conflict, but I watch as they really calmly and with a lot of emotional intelligence explain their side and listen without judgement.

I’m involved in a conversation with my friend. We’ve been walking for some blocks. We approach someone else riding a different looking kind of bicycle.

The cyclist slows down. My friend approaches the bicyclist and I realize they know each other. They have a conversation that I can’t hear. My friend’s back is to me and I can’t see who the cyclist is. It carries the energy of privacy anyway, so I don’t even try to approach. My friend walks back towards me and the cyclist continues for a few minutes ahead of us, and then she slows down again. Again, my friend approaches the cyclist and they have a private conversation. My friend comes back to me and says, “My friend doesn’t talk to that many people. So don’t take it personally. It’s just how she is.” I say, “That’s fine.” We are walking while she says this.

My fake name still began with S., but my last name was changed. I had to approach a receptionist's window where I handed a woman my paper and she directed me to proceed.

I was younger as well and vaguely recollect being about 15 or 16.   Everyone had to work and was paid wither $8 a day or $8 a week. There were adult guards dressed in light greenish tan uniforms. At this point I was convinced that this was a concentration camp.   In the concentration camp, everyone worked hard to get promoted so that they would be transferred to a camp where they were instead paid $800 a day or week. I was skeptical and at this point in the dream I had become a detective whose job it was to figure out what was going on. At lunch, we all lined up to eat, and I made an announcement telling everyone that this was a concentration camp and that the promotion camp was actually the place where they took people to gas them. Everyone laughed as they had already figured this much out.  My brother William was with me now and the guards came to take us as we were now seen as trouble makers. They loaded us into a helicopter and flying low to the ground left the camp. There was an adult with us in the chopper who began to plot our escape.

Yet at the same time, they seem to be outlined with makeup or some kind of eyeliner just around the lids. The face shield is not right on my face; it’s an inch away from my face. It’s made out of hard material like a lampshade would have been made of. It’s kind of waxed.",

I’m staying in this house with him, but I’m not sure why. He has other people in the house with him and it’s like he collects orphans and I’m one of the orphans he’s collected. I’m in one of the bedrooms sleeping, zonked out, kind of, but I can see people coming in and out of the bedroom to see me. There’s a cleaning lady that comes in at some point and cleans around me while I’m passed out in the bed. The little man is entertaining other people. It’s very interesting. I don’t know what happens. At some point, the man brings his friend over who is the same height as him. She’s a woman and has a bob cut, her hair is red and short. This little man has grey, shoulder length hair. They act out this skit together, kind of like a TikTok. They act out this skit that I watch. I’m observing all this and the way he treats people who are coming in and out of his house is a little strange and removed. Then the scene changes. I’m with my friend Josh. I'm seeing these gigantic redwood trees. There’s a road next to me on my left and the shoulder is so wide that it looks like a park. There are picnic tables and at one table, people are throwing a birthday party - I’m guessing, but not sure. They’re having a meal together. It’s warm out and reminds me of Hawaii, even though the trees are redwood, they sway like palm trees. I’m hearing the sound of the ocean. It’s a gathering of people coming together to celebrate. It feels nice and pleasant and celebratory. There’s affection with all the people. Cars are whizzing by because it’s still a road. A couple of feet down there is another picnic table and another group of people celebrating, so it’s like there are all these pods of celebrations happening. Then the dream switches. I’m showing Josh how to get to this one valley where there are waterfalls and pools of water. I’ve actuall (...)",

There are different rooms that open into each other and host different childcare programs. My son isn’t enrolled in any of the programs but I need to visit with someone, so he just hangs around and people sort of welcome him in and watch him while I have my business meeting. We go home and return the next day. This time we are meeting with Kathy and her son, Bodhi. It’s so strange because when I try to introduce the boys, I can’t recall Kathy’s son’s name. I call him by a totally different name, but I can’t recall it. Then I remember his name. It’s Bodhi, but I say body? I’m trying the sound out in my mouth. Kathy steps in and pronounces it correctly. We sort of laugh about it and say this is a distracted overwhelmed mom thing where the mind totally blanks. They go on a walk and are all of a sudden gone, but we were supposed to have a playdate. I get on a phone call. Then my son is gone, too. I get nervous. I’m looking for him and calling for him. I find him in a multiracial daycare. It was multircial the day before, but now it’s only black educators and black children sitting in two circles. My son is with them, but not very welcome. I take him by the hand and we go out and down some stairs like a treehouse. Somehow I lose him again and this time it feels like he’s really far gone. I run up the street looking for him frantically. I see Kathy and Bodhi walking and they seem fine - they were just giving me space to take my phone call. It’s getting late now. I still can’t find my son. I go into the other side of the building. One room is a Waldorf school and the other is another alternative early childhood education space. I’ve been talking with them about their philosophies. I sigh in relief when I see my son there.

They’re either standing up talking or leaning against the walls talking or sitting on chairs or furniture or on the floor. It’s extremely crowded. The other room is a kitchen. No one is in there. It’s a small room. There’s another room off of the kitchen that has a closed door to it. I can’t really see what’s in there. I get the sense that people are in it. The kitchen has a doorway at one end that feeds into the living room. There’s a wall in between so you can’t see who’s in the room from the kitchen. When the dream starts, I’m in the crowded room. I feel like I can’t move my body. I’m feeling a little bit claustrophobic. Although there are a lot of conversations going on, I’m not part of any of them. I’m starting to feel a little alienated or lonely. I leave the room and go out into the kitchen and am just standing there. My friend Randy joins me. His hair has gotten a lot longer, it’s touching his shoulders, it’s really curly and sticking out all over the place. His body is bigger. Everything is rounder. He picks me up, throws me over his shoulder and he has arms on the front of his body and arms on the back of his body. So he has four arms. He’s tall. He starts moving his body quickly from side to side, from one leg to the other leg and back. It creates this feeling like being rocked. I can feel the swiftness of the movement. It starts to feel really relaxing and I can start to feel the tension from being in the crowded room and feeling alienated leaving my body. I start to relax. I let my head relax and my upper body, my shoulders, my arms and my hands. I close my eyes for a little bit and just give into this swaying feeling. This goes on for a little bit.

People are gathered around the tables; some are sitting, some are standing. I’m at the second table from the back. There is a series of movements that people have to execute and they’re being judged and marked. The people who are doing the judging and marking are friendly and conversational. They go from table to table making small talk. Then they ask people: “Are you ready then?” The people respond, “yes” or “no, not quite.” So if they say yes, they go up to a space that’s around the front table and do the movements. Then basically they clear out after that. But not everyone is leaving; there’s still a lot of friendly chit-chat going on along the sides of the table. I’ve noticed that the wave of people getting up and finishing is getting closer to my table. I tell the people that I’m sitting with that it’s almost our time and maybe we should rehearse. So we do. One of the people is a spotter and holds out an arm. You have to somersault overtop the arm and land on your feet. Then the third person pierces cartilage that runs down the side of our neck, like an aquatic gill, with an instrument. It has to be done at exactly the right spot, or it will hurt. If you put it in the right spot, it won’t hurt. This also has to be done quickly. This is why some people are missing or doing the somersault improperly so they don’t land in the right place and straighten up in the right place in order to have this piercing. So it’s our turn now. The person who is judging this does come around and says: “Are you ready?” We say yes. I’m doing the somersault. There’s a taller woman doing the holding out of the arm. Then I’m also doing the piercing. So we go up to the clearing in front of the table. I’m about to do the somersault when there’s a commotion at the back.

I do this until they are little tiny pieces of potato in the colander. Two other members of my family (it’s fuzzy who they are) come in. They are criticizing the way I’ve done this and saying it won’t work. My nephew returns to the kitchen and says, “Oh yes, this will work. This is how I learned to do it at school. I’ve done this before. It’s fine.” Because he said that, the people who were criticizing me stop criticizing. Then the potatoes are cooked and they’ve turned out just fine.",

The train was old-fashioned with red and white coloring. There was another train track beside ours, but for some reason, trains also stacked on top of one another such that one had to be careful when climbing on top of the train.  Eventually the train took us all to the ocean. The tracks went over the water for a ways before they dipped below the waves and we were under the sea. We were surprised that the train was air-tight. Eventually we got into the complex which was some sort of abandoned aquatic museum mixed with a military complex. It had a name which I remembered when I first woke up but have since forgotten.  I think we were actually fully submerged in the building yet we were able to breathe. We looked around. It was an open atrium with a bone-like structure made from a blue whale above us. It might have been supporting the building. There were hallways radiating out from us as if they were the blood vessels or organs of the whale.   Our mom wasn't with us and we had to go back to her or bring her with us--or just tell that we were safe. We left and that was when I had a conversation with my mom where one of us mentioned the name of the place. It had three words in it.",

There are a bunch of people in the shop. I’m totally appalled. The shop sells all kinds of things. It’s kind of dim and there isn’t very good lighting. It’s strange that customers are here because I know that I’ve closed the shop and the owner has died. But this other person has let these people in and they’re shopping. It’s really packed. One of the customers comes up to me and is like, “I saw this dress on this mannequin and I want to buy it. Is it still for sale?” I’m like, “No. Nothing’s for sale. We’re not selling anything. The owner has just died.” This customer is really insistent. I’m really shocked at the level of disrespect they have for the death of the owner. They just don’t care; their focus is on getting what they want. Then the woman I’m working for is like, “Yep, just sell it to them.” I’m kind of shocked at her disrespect for this man who has just died and was elderly.

Then I'm not where I’m supposed to be. At one point I’m on a giant bus instead of a boat… In one scenario, I’m down by a river and I’m watching some cargo be loaded into various boats. It’s actually really pretty. I’m standing in a forested area and the river isn’t very big. A woman gets on a smaller boat with two children. She stores the gear. It seems like somebody else is in front, but I don’t see him. She makes reference to him. People are saying: “Are you sure you should be going that way?” She’s a little bit rebellious and says something like: “I’m not a novice.” Then I can see that she has some kind of equipment on the stern. She folds it out. It’s actually quite fascinating because it folds up so neatly that you don’t really notice it on the stern. It’s got spring loaded parts to it. She folds it out and it snaps in place. Then there’s another fold in it and she folds that out and it snaps in place. She stands on the one in the back. Then her two kids run out and she places them on the one in the middle. It’s like ropes that go across and they’re hanging onto it with their feet braced on one part and their hands clinging to the other. She stands on the one in the back and the man she’s with - her partner or whatever - is still in the front.

There’s a glass dome - the kind that would go over a lamp - and all these other things I’m afraid of breaking. She takes them down one by one, thenI can get back down onto my knees, move my hands towards them, then back to the end of the shelf where I can dangle my legs over the edge, hang on with my hands, and kind of jump down the rest of the way.

Other people are standing around and I know one of them - Blake. He gives me a bear hug and says, “It’s really good to see you.” As he lifts me up, my feet are off the ground. I can feel my body stretching - it feels like a full body stretch. When he sets me down, I wish he would do it again because the stretching felt really good. We’re being told to continue on our way towards the building. I notice the guys are wearing football uniforms - jerseys and pants. I wonder if I’m there for a game.",

I have this lingering sense that I need to go take care of myself and do the things I need to do, but there is an obligation or responsibility that I need to help out the group. It’s a bunch of my sisters I regularly meet with on council. It’s a post-apocalyptic world. Things need cleaning up. I can see black smoking buildings in the background. It’s like we’ve hobbled together a kind of life out of the ruins of this thing. But I’m really clear that there are some things I need to take care of for my own life. As I’m walking away, I’m walking through this hallway with shopping carts littered everywhere. I’m passing by and heading to my own destination. One of my sisters is like, “Rose, come help me clean these carts. It’s something we need to do.” I get a sense of resentment because I know it needs to happen but I also need to get my own stuff done. So I start to clean the carts with her and then we move from doing that to getting in a vehicle with a bunch of supplies that need to be handed out and donated to other people. I know I’m doing things that need to be done and are helpful for others, but I have a long list of things I need to do but am not getting to and it’s really important that I do them. I keep in my head hearing, “Rose, you aren’t meant for the group exercises or activities. You’ve gotta go do your thing. What you have to do is really important.” I keep hearing that, but I’m not doing it and I keep staying with and keep getting pulled in. Now the truck we’re in gets stuck and it needs to be moved out. So my other friend says, “Okay now let’s get the truck out from where it’s stuck.” There are constantly things that are being added one thing after another because of course that’s life. But I’m so resentful because I’m not going off and doing any of the things I want to do. The dream ends with me trying to sneak away from all of my friends. It’s very bizarre.",

I’m really clear that I don’t want that responsibility. I’m going to make sure they get where they need to go, but after that the choices I make are going to have a lot less to do with being their caretaker 24/7. These are not my kids. These are just random children. I can't tell if it’s a school or daycare or something. It’s everybody’s children, but they are not of my body. So, there are other people around who are also caretaking them and trying to get them to wherever they need to go. There’s just this feeling of needing to get them to a safe place.

The people I went to see in the dream were familiar to me in the dream but not in real life. I went to see a couple and I think in the dream I had known the male previously but it was years and years since I had seen him. When I got to their house we practiced yoga and I remember doing lots of hip openers and it was like I almost couldn’t get the deepest stretch because in everything I did, I was so flexible (this has not been the case in real life as I’ve not been able to practice like I used to). But the release that I felt from forward folds of all types was amazing - it was like I just folded into myself. I think I did a bunch of seated spinal twists, too. These are all things I can do in real life but for some reason in the dream I was like Gumby and I couldn’t find the tension to release half of the time. Then we all went to bed on the same bed, but it was not sexual. We just fell asleep and when we woke up we had to go somewhere so we scurried around getting ready and we were leaving. I needed to go back and do something like take my medicine or something like that. I messed up the covers and then I woke up.",

There are farming pieces and sides all made of iron and hand-hammered - you can see the little pound marks and everything. It stretches from the eating area through what would be the kitchen area into a longer gathering place where there are other rooms that are dark - I can’t see what’s in them but I think they are bedrooms. I’m standing in that area. I’ve walked in through the front door, through the parlor, through the kitchen area, and now I’m standing in the back parlor. Other people are there and in my dream I know them but I don’t recognize them with my conscious mind to give them a name now. They’re dressing in various kinds of wetsuits. They have diving equipment and masks. Some of the wetsuits are the short ones, some are longer in the leg. The idea is to go out snorkeling or diving into the stream that runs on the property behind the ranch house. I feel like I’m ready to go and I’m confident. So, I walk out and it’s winter. There’s snow on the ground. I walk out the door along the snow, along the bank of the river, until I get to the point where it’s been decided that I will enter. Everyone is entering at a different place. I start to climb down a river bank that’s probably about four feet high. I’m backing down on my stomach. Where my feet are supposed to hit solid ground, they don’t. It breaks from underneath the weight of my body, but there’s so much of my body already over the embankment that I can’t pull myself back up and I just slip down into the freezing icy cold water.

We get over the bridge and I’m sweating because it’s freaking me out. We get to a downtown area where the buildings are close, the streets are narrow, and there are a lot of pedestrians. I’m very anxious to get the car parked back at the house becuase I’m scared I’m going to kill someone or everyone in the car. I still don’t know what I’m on or why I have this anxiety around driving. Eventually we do get back to the house. I get out of the car. A bunch of people go inside. I go inside for a second. The house is interesting - it’s a very Victorian era looking house on the outside and inside. It’s got a lot of space - the ceilings are tall, which kind of contradicts the Victorian era architecture because the houses are usually kind of small on the inside. I’m inside for a little bit. I go to the backyard and the area where the Mexican-American anti-racism talk was supposed to happen is actually happening in the backyard. The landscape changes from town to lush woodland.

Whoever is supposed to be piloting this boat is missing in action. He's somewhere down below, not in the wheelhouse. The boat is not very large, perhaps a big yacht. I'm concerned, the current is flowing 6-7 knots, maybe more. Daytime. Night. Riding in an open rail car. Possibly streetcar, but I think train, though some crowded city streets, going maybe 10 miles per hour. Feels faster to me, but I look to the side and see a woman running or walking briskly, who is keeping pace. I'm aware of a mismatch between my perceptions of how fast the trains was moving, and the speed of this woman. In the car with me were a woman and one or more other people. Daytime. The same woman and other people are walking in a rural landscape. Fields on wither side, and low, forested hills beyond. We get to the end of the field and begins to ascend one of the hills, following a well-graded dirt road. I ask one of the women if she had ever been here before, and she says no. We had a destination. Subsequent to this walking. Much forgotten. I'm lying down near the edge of a rocky headland. Quite like the San Juans, with the mix of open woods and exposed rock.

There's thick moss that grows over the rocks and a little beyond the edge, so you can't tell where the true edge is, and what would support your weight and what wouldn't. This woman wants me to do something. I decline, because the moss is hazardous. Then she and the other people (?) are no longer present. Daytime, sunny, clear bleu sky.

As we watched, a brown rabbit ran up, jumped to the top of the stump and began to bite into the far-side of the baby's neck. The rabbit hit the jugular vein and the child died. The rabbit dashed off into the woods. Neither of us made any attempt to do anything, which I thought was odd. My dad, who was outside, rushed after the rabbit as it ran into the woods. The rabbit almost got away, but my dad caught it, picked it up, and dashed it against the ground. I was sure it was dead, but it jumped up and limped away into the forest.

I see one friend from high school who I haven’t seen or thought about in a while. He is sitting across this really big table from me. All of a sudden I see him lift his hand and I can feel this force coming from his hand and he’s pushing against me. This whole time we were talking about some of things I can do, and he said, “Oh yeah, watch this. Can you do this?” I feel a force or pressure from his hand as if someone is pushing on me. It’s not malicious or anything; he’s just trying to show me what he can do. I’m shocked because I can’t do it and I feel a little embarrassed that I should be able to do this but I can’t. Then he goes: “Okay now, watch this.” There’s a billboard that comes up across and squares and diamonds start appearing at the top and he’s making this happen. In the dream, I have this recognition that I haven’t seen him in a long time and he went somewhere then came back and can do all this cool stuff. Then the dream shifts. We’re on land now.

I feel like he’s judging me for not being able to balance and not being able to get the dance moves down. Then the scene switches.

I heard that an illegal deal was going down and knew that if I made it there I could either expose it or join the plot and end up making a profit. I got in my black Ferrari and drove to the edge of a canyon. Before I got there, I was clipped by a passing truck and my car sustained some damage in the front. There was a dirt ramp leading up to the canyon and I knee the bad guys were halfway up the cliff wall on the other side. I tried making the jump but did not have enough speed. I backed up to give myself more distance to accelerate. This time I made it and flew through the air for an impossibly long time before landing perfectly below the people I was after.  They heard me approaching and captured me. But once they realized that I was willing to aid their cause they grew friendlier and filled me in on the plan. I agreed to help and they told me that they would send someone for me later. I was a bit worried about that for some reason.   We had been in a building and walking through the hallway in the building, I saw a room where prostitutes were lying. I took one to seal the deal and brought her to another room. At this point I was lucid enough to realize at a low level that this was a dream and I knew that I was giving in to a temptation.   We began to have sex, but she then told me that we couldn't. I didn't understand why, but then another female, dressed in white broke into the dream. When she did, I noticed that we were now in a green, sunlight area outdoors. I think the reason I could not have sex with the prostitute was that I was in love with the other girl.",

    "text": "“Circus Dives” I’m at a circus. There are various tents, clowns and the usual stereotypical circus performers - round people with beards, people walking on stilts. There are rides and carnival tricks and games. It’s night time. I’m walking through the various tents. Then I see a great big huge pool of dark water. It must have some kind of wave generator because it looks like there are waves, then it’s swirling around like a whirlpool, then it will stop and a big artificial tidal wave will rise up. Then when it subsides the water is choppy. Then the water will change shape and create some other kind of natural water type phenomena. All of a sudden, this person comes up and grabs me the way someone would grab a person to sling them onto the back of a saddle if they were riding a horse. I feel myself grabbed by the wrist and flung up to the back of a motorcycle. The motorcycle starts to go around and around this great big pool of water in a circle. Then I can feel us lift and I realize it’s left the ground and I’m airborne. I’m getting higher and higher. I can feel my body fighting for ground but also starting to recognize its lightness. Then the motorcycle driver dives down from the height in the sky and goes down and into the pool and underneath the water and all the way up into the sky again. I see that the water is still changing into natural shapes and formations that it was when I observed it from the ground. I’m thinking, “How are we going to make it back up again?!” My body keeps being just a little bit behind so every time there’s a dive, I still feel my body is going up. So there’s this moment of disequilibrium with each dive and each rise back up into the sky. At this moment I notice the driver is wearing a red leather suit with white and blue on it like the American Evel Knievel. The person underneath the mask is this freaky guy from high school. I don’t trust him, but I’m noticing at the same time that he seems to be navigating this really well, as though  (...)",

I’m hoping I’ll blend in with them and they will not notice I’m human, but animal like them. We’ll run together and catch up with the injured one ahead. A man who runs with these animals has joined us and is running just behind me down the path. One of the animals falls but is able to get up and continue. Scene change. A group of people gather on a rooftop. They are making a temporary home each night on this roof, setting up tents, cooking food. A man who used to live in his van at the river is there. He now has a truck and it doesn’t appear that he lives in the truck, so I think he’s bought a house. But he is traveling with us. Every night we set everything up then take everything down in the morning. We go on a journey during the day, taking the truck. We pull out all our kitchen and sleeping supplies at night. One night, a woman takes out a fancy grill - so much nicer and easier to use than the one we’ve been using because there is no need to hook up propane. You just push a button for the heat and another button for the water. I feel a little ashamed of my smaller one, but realize mine serves a purpose because it is smaller and more easily transported.",

He is not only not interested in my complaint, he offers a counter-argument, that he says will reliably shock me, or something like that. A lot about searching for a sweatshirt that I had taken off earlier. Frank and I are sitting across a bench, both on the same side of a picnic table. He's telling me to get used to the no social distancing. I should stop worrying about it. He gets closer and closer, and then finally I say, y'know, I'm still objecting, and I'm objecting to you being so close. I say, you're close enough to kiss me. At this he's taken aback, and stops to think about it. Then he leans in, and it's not a real kiss, but he's blowing on my face, and some of his saliva gets on the corner of my mouth, brushes his lips agains the corner of my mouth. I'm not happy about this. After this Frank disappears, but I'm worried and upset. I start looking into other school districts, and complaining to people. A long bit at the house of Mark Fowler, who in this dream has a wife. It goes on and on, and I'm looking for the top layer of my clothing. I don't want to wear my sportcoat, and I don't want to wear just a t-shirt. I want to have an intermediate layer, so I'm looking for a shirt or a sweatshirt. I look both in the schoolyard and in their home, which sometimes has a house behind it, and sometimes doesn't. I'm still thinking about how close Frank got, and was that an exposure. I finally leave Mark Fowler's place around dawn. It's summer, so 4-5 am.",

I then slipped into a dream where I was speaking to Grandma V. and my mother. Eventually I asked my grandmother who had brought food to their joint Thanksgiving celebration. I knew that she had done all of the cooking, but asked for some ulterior motive, possibly to make other relatives in the room feel bad. She indicated that it was only she who had prepared the food.  My awareness returned as my whole body began to vibrate. I hoped I was about to have an OBE. I was rushing upwards as the vibrations continued. I felt a pressure and heaviness.

She was also intimidating as she was taller than me by several inches, was very large, and had a hard face. I did still approach her, introduce myself, and gave her a hug which she returned.  The next day, we were preparing for dinner when she began a rant about Christianity. She was speaking very metaphorically about Christ, saying something about the world soul and giving birth via reproductive organs. There was however some insanity in her speech and she swore profusely and kept bringing up Nazis.  I was very excited to have someone to talk to about religion who was more eccentric and I asked her if she could explain more about the reproductive process and if this meant that Christ intentionally gave us an impossible and incoherent task to teach us that there is something else we need or should believe. She affirmed this.  When we had sat down at table, she was swearing so much that my dad quietly and politely asked her if she would refrain when around young people. She was obstinate and refused. My dad implored her reminding her that Uncle P. was willing to do this for the family on a previous occasion. I wanted to tell Clara that her religion was worthless if it hadn't changed her such that she could be kind and humble before family, but I held my tongue.",

A three or four foot wide sleeping porch, balcony. The windows have a roll-down sunscreen in front of them, so you cant see out very well. To the right is a door to the sleeping porch. This faces an interior courtyard of the building, so there's no view. The sleeping porch has a flagstone floor which projects somewhat, and on the left nearly touches the corresponding part of another unit. There's a high-tech tyranny. The regime used very advanced method of control, including drugs. It's also, simultaneously, a movie that I'm watching, in which I am the protagonist. I come and go from the apartment several times. There's heavy security outside, guarding the entrance. There's a guy I'm watching. He's capable of resisting all their methods. There's a few people at the security table, and one of them follows the guy outside as he goes out of the building, and attempts to use, I forget what exactly he does, uses some device or method to try to control this guy, but they don't work. In fact, the guy reflects it all back at him. Very energetic blue-white rays come out of his eyes, and go into the eyes of the would-be controller and turn him into a vacant zombie shell. Then he goes back through security to reënter the building, and they're incapable of reacting. It's as if they don't see him. A woman watches him go in with a mixture of fear and awe, because no one has been able to resist this stuff before. He's kind of like a cybernetic hero. Back in this apartment, there are scenes of gay sex. Two guys, young men, late teens, having sex in a manner that resembles a wrestling contest, but it's sexual. I see one of their dicks.

I asked her to clarify her question and provide more details and soon found out that I could discover much about this person. I was very curious, but knew that this was wrong. I overcame my curiosity and made clear who I was. The receptionist asked why I was wearing the blanket around my mouth to which I responded by telling her that I didn't have a mask. She handed me a large, sturdy, grey and pink N95-style mask which I examined. I am not sure if I put it on.  I walked out of the doctor's office onto the street. It was mid-day and sunny.

In the lower level it's very modern, concrete floor, quite extensive. Spaces there for artists and creative people. They're walking through there. One space of a couple of rooms, quite bare, concrete walls with bas-reliefs of strange fish. Odd shapes.... But even though it's just two or three rooms, I get lost in there for a while, a few, minutes, until I figure how to get back out. In this basement at one point I see one or two boys, maybe eight or nine years old. They're very happy and run through. I take it that they are Benson's sons. One has quite short hair, not a crewcut, and glasses. I thought, how cool it would be if your dad was Benson Billford. That would be interesting. A long segment, somehow Friedrich is involved. All these crystals. The room is full of them. They're extremely fragile. At one point I load a bunch of stuff onto this small platform, maybe 18 or 20 inches by 10, a foot at most, and the thing disappears, sinks down into the floor. Some time later it comes up out of what looks a bit like a fireplace grate that's in front of me, and now there are more bunches of crystals. I touch one or several, and they fall apart from each other into individual crystals. I feel bad, and don;t know what the repercussions will be. I try not to disturb any more, but I do, so finally I leave that space. This had something to do with Friedrich, but I don't remember what. An important woman, and organizer of something or other. Forget how this transpired, but she either wants me, invites me to kiss her, or asks me if I would like to kiss her. Think the former. So I do, and given what she'd said and how she's said, it, I attempt to make it passionate, some French kissing, After that's over I ask her how she found it, and she says, not very good, meaning I wasn't very good at it. Given that it (...)",

I find this out while sitting with Gail at a small particle board table that has been painted and carved to look nicer. Gail’s oldest daughter is picking at the table and ruining it. Gai’s husband is sitting further behind her on the ground and listening into the conversation. The whole situation makes me feel uneasy. Then I see that Irene has found a new lover in her building. She’s wearing a long fitted lace red gown and is excited to go meet him. Then she changes her clothes to a grey silk deep plunging gown over black slacks. She looks so beautiful and I’m envious, but know I couldn’t wear either of those outfits because I’m not tall and thin. Irene is going to meet her lover. Then she ends up going to the second story. Katy is there and they are having a wonderful deep engaging conversation. Again, I’m feeling left out as if I don’t belong and have nothing of value to contribute. On a floor above is a barber shop. My dad is getting his hair cut. My mom is there, too. Then somehow this barber shop is in another building - a hospital. Ted tells me he’s been enjoying talking to and seeing my parents on the floor just above where he works. I’m happy to see Ted and talk with him. My mom and I then go out to dinner. We’re sitting in a dark restaurant and a man is sitting with us. He feels a bit creepy. The waiter comes by and has a thick Irish accent. I order fries and then my mom orders. Then the waiter and the man start talking with each other in Gaelic. I’m wanting to interrupt so I can speak and learn the language again. The guy at my table is reading a poem. I ask if the word means garter as I make a motion of pulling a garter up over my leg. They look at me and laugh as if humoring me. They are laughing as if it was some sort of sexual innuendo that I didn’t catch. The waiter disappears and doesn’t return to our table (...)",

We were outside of a shopping complex near the school and the cops had decided to do a drug test of everyone coming out of one of the grocery stores. Everyone who came out was wearing a green shirt which was the brand color of the store. There was some legal precedent allowing the cops to target only the people from this store. It may have been a store policy. I had not been shopping there but was still not going to have any of it. I joined all of the shoppers who had lined up and were approaching the cop in order to be drug tested. The others told me to get out of line since there was no need for me to go through all of this since I hadn't been in the store. They told me that if I was seen with them, the cops would not care that I hadn't been in the store. But I wanted to make a scene and to take a stand. I walked up to where the cops were and then kept on walking.  \"Stop right there,\" one of the cops said to me. He looked an awful lot like a friend  who had been my RA in college. I had respected him as an authority figure and as a friend.  \"I wasn't in the store, so you have no legal grounds for making me do a drug test.\" I answered.  \"Why are you with the shoppers then?\"  \"It doesn't matter. I wasn't in the store and you can't make me take a drug test. I'm going to walk away now. Are you going to arrest me?\"  I walked away and he came after me. Somehow I ended up in his car, though I hadn't been arrested, and he began to discuss with me how I needed to respect the law and be a good citizen. I obviously gave him a piece of my mind given that I was a good citizen and that he was clearly in the wrong for drug testing people when this was an oversight of peoples' privacy and many drugs could be beneficial. Still, the atmosphere of the dream was that I was the wayward citizen being implored by the wise cop to reform my ways. I wouldn't agree to see things his way and eventually I think I was let go.",

It wrapped itself around my finger. It was at most 6 inches in length. It had a very small head so I wasn't worried about it biting me, but it opened its mouth impossibly wide and began swallowing my finger. It could only get so far, but it began to tighten around my finger to the point that it became slightly uncomfortable.  It did this several times, and I wanted to show my dad because I found it interesting. When he came to look, it started to swallow my entire arm. It shot up my arm in telescoping green ring-like bracelets. I was still not worried but it was certainly odd.

The stars and the moon are fairly bright and I can see outlines and shapes of different people. I don’t see anyone I know until Trent. comes up behind me. He doesn’t say anything but I know it’s him and I feel somewhat comforted by the presence of someone I know. We walk for a little while, quite close together because the crowd is that thick. There’s no room for personal space. Then I feel him pressed up at my back. I can feel that he’s somewhat hard although I don’t mind and I feel myself becoming aroused. We walk like this for some moments. Then, the band has arrived. People are starting to organize in seats. For some reason there are theatre seats lined up in rows. There’s a center row, a right wing and a left wing. At this point, Trent leaves and joins some people that he seems to know. I find my seat. People aren’t sitting down though, they’re just standing up. I don’t see anyone I know. I do however see a group of friends. The issue is that my ex best friend, the narcissist, is sitting there with her mom, so I don’t want to sit with my friends. I don’t want to interact with her. I sit by myself. Then there's this big delay. The band takes forever plugging their instruments in, then doing sound checks, then restructuring all the wiring again and taking it apart. An agonizing hour of waiting for the band to start goes by. They still continue to fiddle. So I leave the area and wander back to where the crowd is. I’m looking for Trent because he’s the only person I’ve seen and know. I don’t find him.",

The inside of the house had completely rotted, like it had been abandoned and was left in ruins but with stuff everywhere. The lights didn’t work. Plants were growing through the floorboards. Spider webs everywhere. A spider landed on my face and I couldn't get it off like it was Velcro. It was huge, like a tarantula. My sister tried to get it off but couldn’t. I clawed at it on my forehead and pulled off a leg but it still wouldn’t budge. Finally it crawled to the top of my head and my sister pulled it out and threw it. Then we started sorting through the piles and ended up in a grappling fight over some sewing needles and thread that we both claimed were ours. After we fought we had to continue cleaning the place. People came over, aunts and uncles I haven’t seen for a decade, cousins, friends. And there was a woman named Mim. She was young and Chinese. She was taking care of me. She kept telling me that she was inspired by me for getting out of town and making a new life for myself. It’s what she wanted to do also and didn’t know how.",

Seems to be after school -- nowhere in the dream am I in front of the class. There were two books I was saving for students. Just paperbacks, but reading assignments. I don't know how long it had been, but a student comes looking for one of the books, and I can't find it. It is not where it is supposed to be, and now I have no idea. I feel bad that I can't help this kid. In the dream the title was clear. Now it's after school, but the room fills up with students and two teachers, and I'm puzzled because I didn't know about this. I ask one of the teachers if this is a regularly scheduled class, but forget what they said. One student has a book and is about to cut some pictures out of it. This was before I spoke to the teacher. Not a textbook, but a book from the room's library. I stop him and ask for the pictures. He hands me some little, pinkish gold scissors that are barely two inches long. I ask him to give it to me, and he does. I point him to some National Geographics that he can cut up, but ask him to let me know which ones he takes. He seems okay with that, but then I recall that many of the National Geographics had been used up already. So I tel him to come and see me if he can't find anything. It gets so late that it is almost dark. I don't have a class roster, I don't know the bell schedule, and I don't know if I am working there full or part time. I don't know what time I am supposed to show up in the morning. And I don't know where my mailbox is. The campus is different. The little admin building is just a couple of latrines.

Up until they arrived, we were all just playing and having a good time. When they arrive, it’s almost as if they’re watching us play. There are at least forty or fifty of them. They’re all sitting at these long tables. I go up to talk to them with the little bit of Japanese I know. This seems to delight everyone. This festival quality comes into the air - celebration is happening. They’re really happy to observe us having a good time. We’re going to do some dances and put on a show. I’m like, “Oh, I’m in my play clothes and they’re dirty, so I’m going to go get dressed up for dancing on stage.” I go to get dressed up and I can’t find any clothes that I like or that fits or looks good. I find a pair of mom jeans that do not look attractive. Then I look in the mirror and am like, “What is wrong with my face?” My face looks really old and weird. And my hair is short. I’ve got this short mom haircut that is not attractive. The hair is dark and I’m thinking, “Oh, what if dyed it?” So, I think I’ll dye it blonde. When I look in the mirror my hair is suddenly blonde with crazy root grow out.Then I’m like, “No, that doesn’t look good. I don’t like that. What if I turn the blonde part pink and the roots turn purple?” I look in the mirror and sure enough, my hair turns that color. So my hair looks cute, but it’s kind of straw’ish - like what happens when you color your hair a lot. But when I look at myself, I think, “Wow, you’re really trying whatever you can to look cute for these dances on stage, but you don’t.” I’m being pretty harsh on myself.

Jared left as I went up to the the third floor with Daniel while we looked around the bare room that we had once called home. The semester was just starting and we saw that other students were just beginning to move in and get situated. For some reason, I was sure that I had left something behind in the room from when I had moved out, so we began a careful search. We found a handful of things that I had missed, but not the one or two that I was sure that I had misplaced. Among these was a notebook and a pocket knife, my old Buck knife.  I brought all of the things we found home to my parents' house and sorted through them there. One of the objects was a mini air hockey table with a black and white checkers type game on the reverse side. Inside of the table was some empty space and looking there I found my missing items. I wasn't sure how I could have been so careless as to leave them behind in the first place.  Back on the road with Jared, it was raining and we stopped at a red light. An old homeless man approached Jared's window and whacked it so hard with his hand that it almost shattered, and developed several spider-web cracks. I was apprehensive but Jared rolled down his window and spoke with the man for a moment before it became clear that he was up to no good. We took off but were worried that he and the others who were likely with him would come after us. They did come after us.  We got to a motel where we got out and hid inside hoping that they wouldn't have spotted us. But in following true dream logic, they knew exactly where we were. One man came in, and I believe he was carrying a handgun, though I am not certain. I told Jared to run back and call the police, while I grabbed a small, but sharp kitchen knife from the counter. The man entered the front door and grabbed one of the civilians standing nearby. I rushed at him with the knife a (...)",

Imagine like a tropical Esalen with a mile between cliffs and beach where you could reach the beach safely and warm enough to swim all the time. The first part of my dream I was exploring this landscape alone and barely came across other people. The second time the dining area had reopened and I was in line for dessert and there was cheesecake, but everything looked fake, like not real food. The next time I was there for a weekend with a group of people, all younger than me. We went all the way down to the ocean water and it was pitch black but we lit it up somehow by swirling around in the water, and people were standing and sitting on the edge watching us. It was provocative but not blatantly sexual; it felt more like we were sharing love than having sex but to outsiders, someone commented when we were walking back up “thanks for the show, I’ve been here 60 years and never seen one like that.” I felt embarrassed at the time, like they thought we were disinhibited on drugs or drunk but we weren’t. Then we started walking to the top and it wasn’t nighttime anymore but no sun; it was all gray. There were people who looked homeless (holding small signs) seated wedged in with people enjoying the view. There was an ex boyfriend of mine from high school and I went to say hi. He made a comment about me being seen down below and something about white girls (he is black If this is something meaningful) and seemed angry with me. This was not the response I would expect after 20 plus years of not seeing each other. Then there were more people out and I started walking towards the entrance when three people with huge banners came tumbling down into the crowd and someone yelled “get them out of there! Here we go again!” and it was the peopl (...)",

There’s a physical feeling of motion, of waves, of something small like iotas touching my skin and letting me know that I have a physical body that exists somewhere. Because my eyes cannot really see anything but daylight itself, I attend to the feeling on my skin to determine where I am. I sense rather than see a wooden floor, a planked wooden floor and walls also made of wood. It’s like I can feel vibration. I’m now sensing that there are other people and I sense an elderly man with the energy of a patriarch, but loving like a grandfather; then that softer more active love of a matriarch or grandmother. They have family. I can feel they are tied together by the vibrational quality of love, affection, interaction, and connection. They are bubbly. There’s joy here. There's also a sense of industry and cooperation. I feel now that there is a rhythm in the dynamic of their extended family. At the same time as I’m sensing into this, I’m feeling like the whole scenario is moving forward. As I deepen into their family dynamic, I start to see more colors and form. I start to see that they’re seated, they’re boisterous and talking to each other. It’s almost like it’s a mealtime, though they aren’t eating food. They’re passing around something in a cup. Their family is colorful. There’s something wrapped around the woman’s head. There’s the draping of brightly colored cotton clothing, although the man seems to be wearing a shirt. I notice their skin is glowing. There’s a sense of emanating light. Then I think that their whole skin is softer and more radiant, even of the family members’ whose arms and hands I can see. I seem to be zooming in and noticing that the hands are luminescent. It suddenly clicks in my mind that I can smell olive oil. Then, it further connects that what they are passing around in the cup is olive oil and there’s this joy that they have (...)",

He’s a combination of different energies, including Swamiji. There are quite a few people gathered, some remind me of people from high school and others from college. There’s also my husband and me. My husband is upset and distant from me. He’s talking with other circles of people. I go into my room that I share with a group of people. I am witness to a murder and brainwashing. I’m not entirely brainwashed though, so I see it for what it is. It’s really disturbing. The priest is there. His assistant is with him. I feel sick to my stomach and don’t want to remember what I saw. They manipulate this young man, making him into a zombie-like state, then kiss all the life out of him. The people continue to do their things - folding clothes, brushing teeth, getting dressed. I hear the priest and his assistant talking about what to do with the body. The assistant says, “This may have to be the last one for awhile because there might be some questions about the accident.” They plan to frame his death as a fall down the cliffs.

There's so much snow, the car is stuck in a snowdrift. I realize I'm not going to be able to drive out of the drift. So I pick the car up, carry it to a cleared area, and put it down. As I carry it I'm impressed by my own strength and ability. It was heavy but manageable. First I position the car to enter one road and take a left down the other road, but I soon realize that I'll have to wait there forever, due to the heavy traffic, so I move the car to enter the other street. I wait a long time, and finally just start going down the sidewalk, going west away from the station. The geography is reminiscent of S. 12th, west of Fred Meyer, but not as in reality. No hwy. 176, and in reality there is no gas station in that location. In the dream, the south side of the street is just woods. No snow now.

He's in a hide-a-bed in the living room, and this apartment is an indoor-outdoor space. It's covered, and the ceiling of exposed wood is quite high, but it's open to the side. The ceiling is open on the side and it's raining very heavily outside, and there's a space of a foot or two where the rain is just falling down. Everything is damp. It all seems utterly real. Adam spills something on the bed, perhaps milk? I explain to him to be careful, there's no rubber sheet. I'm not happy at all the laundry I will have to do, but try not to show it. I hadn't been living there very long, and I think, I don't even have a clothes hamper, or a washer and dryer. Margaret is there, too. I was thinking of taking them out to breakfast somewhere, but she's already made some eggs for the two of them. They're sitting at a little table or counter, and she has just put the eggs on the counter, no plates. They have knives and forks. I'm puzzled by that. I explain to her, we're dreaming right now. I know it seems totally real, and it did, and she's eating and chewing and swallowing, and I say later I'll explain what the real deal is. She doesn't react. I'm satisfied that she heard me, but no response other than she pauses what she is doing momentarily. We go out of that unit into what seems to be a common area. Later that day I'll be taking them back to their mom's, but the dream never progresses that far. At first there are just two or three people in this area, but as time goes on more and then more show up. I had bought the unit from Mark Baggins, and turns out he had seriously misrepresented it to me. Turns out it's all communal space. A guy wearing bathing trunks wants to take them off, and eventually does. He's not doing anything wrong, he's just naked.

It's not the monkey's milk per se, but is made from some other gland. It's a very new product, not yet regulated in the USA. The carton has a light mustard yellow background and the lettering on the carton is red. There's a photo of two-thirds of a male monkey, centered on its genitals, that don't look too different from human, except it's covered in fur. I think, this is weird. I tell Margaret that out of an abundance of caution, I'd stay away from it. We're walking outside somewhere, and are overtaken by a group of people, adults and children, a few girls maybe eleven and twelve. Margaret was a bit older, or a combination of that and her present age. Margaret goes off with them, chattering merrily. I'm left standing there, holding the carton, with a mostly empty thought balloon, maybe a few question marks.",

To my right was her house and to my left a beautiful field of green grass and flowers. I walked through the fields taking in the view.   Later I called Grandma O. to let her know where I was and to share my experience with her. I told her about the field, and she told me about how in Germany all of the weddings took place in beautiful fields and that this was the place where great Grandma O. had married. This time I biked through the fields hoping to not disturb anyone. They weren't quite as beautiful the second time.  I returned to the road where I met Grandma O.. I didn't question her having traveled thousands of miles instantaneously. We walked up a hill as the road continued and asked me if I was able to drive. I told her that I couldn't and that the best I could do would be to get a learner's permit by having a doctor sign a note for me. I then realized that this would only allow me to travel within a state and wouldn't help me in Germany. But Grandma O. said that in Germany they were far more lax and would be fine so long as you only drove your car to where you were going.   I began to think about how one could ever drive their car to a place where they weren't going.",

I’m walking through it one direction. Then I get to a point and have to turn around. Now the water is on my left and I start running like I’m in the parade or marathon. I think veterans are running and people on the sidelines are cheering them on. I’m running to this shop in one of the older buildings. The shop is run by my friend.

I’m just carrying this rack of clothes down and putting it down, and I see all these young women and they’re all adorable and gorgeous. One of them is Maria.

It’s a two-story house and I’m really uncertain whether or not we all live together in the safe house or if my son and I are staying in my daughter’s house for the purpose of taking care of her pets. We’re on the main floor of the house when the dream starts. We are looking after her cats and some other strange mix of mammal - I’m not really sure what it is. It has skin that is slightly furry but not a lot of fur, maybe like a horse. It’s small, a little smaller than a cat. It has a long neck and very appealing eyes. We’re going about our daily activities. I’m mucking about in the garden and Daniel is doing his own thing. We feed the mammal-like creatures in the morning and then again at suppertime. We do this for a whole 24-hour day. When I go down to the basement to get something, I see two other tanks there. One of them is a water tank and it’s filled with water creatures. The other one has reptiles in it. I’m horrified because the one with the reptiles is a really large, large, large cage and the reptiles are at the bottom but there’s a tiny very angry chimpanzee about the size of my hand rattling the sides of the cage and screaming because it’s so hungry. I yell up to my son, “Why didn’t you tell me she’s got two more down here?!” He says he’s sorry and he forgot. I’m like, “Oh my god the snakes are all upset!” And there’s a cobra, a black cobra with gold markings on its skin and it’s half-sitting up with its hood fanned out. All the animals are agitated. The water tank with the fish like ones have their teeth bared and I’m afraid they’re going to eat each other. I’m just really horrified and upset that the animals are suffering because we did not feed them. I tell my son to go get the food for the reptiles and the tiny chimpanzee. I’m looking around for the food for the water tank. So I put the food in the tank and am watching the fish eat it. I notice the water level  (...)",

For some reason, Westbrook wants to install a sprinkler or something that will produce a lot of water just outside the window well of my boyhood bedroom. So he does, and turns it on. There's a heavy tarp covering it, so water does not go everywhere. It occurs to me to check the room. When we get there, the seal around the window is leaking, and there's a lot of water on the floor. So Roberto goes back and turns it off, and we now have to clean up the water and fix the seal so it won't leak. Something having to do with a school district board meeting out on the coast of Washington. I'm not on the board, but it's some function where most of those guys are there [sic], in private home. A big home with lots of rooms. A moment where these guys and I are sitting around a table, and pretty much as a group, spontaneously either challenge or mock me. I'm not pleased. I'm not intimidated, I just think it's stupid, and don't respond. Later I'm talking to some older guy -- in the dream I'm a younger man, not my present age -- and he's vaguely somehow south Asian, but I dunno. He counsels me and says I need to respond somehow. I tell him, look, there guys are all big shots, each important in his own way in his community, and I'm just going to blow it off. To engage with that wold be ridiculous. Then I ask him about the house, as I'm concerned that all that water Roberto wants to put down there might disturb the foundation. He agrees that should be considered and looked at, then asks if it has this or that, referring to various tax rules and laws that I know nothing about.Then I mention that the house still belongs to my mother. This seems to change everything for him, and he says to not get ahead of myself. I reflect then I never asked Mom's permission to put the water down. I'm thinking we might need to dig a trench to lead water away, etc. There was some reason why the water. A guy, younger, 30-ish. Had a full head of hair. I found him somew (...)",

The home is very clear and vivid and completely unlike any real home I've ever had. You have to hike up quite a ways to get to it, maybe 100 feet. Fairly steep. We get home, and Mom (?) has made some arrangement with a therapist or perhaps a hair stylist, who is in one of the bathrooms (?) with a client. Then the therapist leaves, and now this other stranger is in our house unsupervised, and not responsible to us but to some other person who is absent for the time being. I ask Mom, if it was Mom, why didn't you ask us if we were okay with this? She starts giving some long, roundabout non-answer that was all about her and the pressures on her. I'm about to say, you're not answering my question but decide to wait in case she eventually does get around to an actual answer. The house now fills up with twenty or thirty young people who go all over the house. Somehow it's related to the previous situation. They're going upstairs to where my bedroom and other bedrooms are. One guy is like, is there any music? Can we get some music? He wants to get a party going. I respond by saying, NO. There's a small mezzanine and this girl comes around it and I face her, a bit of a standoff, and I tell her to go downstairs. I'm upset by the invasion. We'd been traveling and just want to be home and rest amid peace and quiet, but instead the house is full of strangers. But, New York. A jumble of impressions and moments. Early on it was New York in the snow. I had been there, then went away for a few days. When I got back there had been a big dump of snow. Snow and slush everywhere. Very vivid. Something to do with a passenger ship coming in, that I was on. As we arrive the stateroom I was in and others were moved bodily ashore to become part of a building a few blocks away from the water. Then the snow is gone. The theme throughout is crowds of pe (...)",

Looking down on myself, I could see that my hair was shorter by several inches and was thinning a bit on top. This was encouraging because this was a past memory and I was glad that even my past self had this issue.  I moved into my body and asked a question to the witness. I wondered if the question was silly. I was having trouble with my chair and the table in front of me. The chair was too low and the table too high so that I could barely see over the top of it. I tried to sit up straight but to no avail. Eventually the professor grading the assignment stopped me so that we could address the problem. My mother was also there and came over to help.  There were other chairs at a table but most had these knobs on their backs which ensured that they were only ornamental and not useful for sitting.

She has higher cheekbones and slightly Asian features. I have two friends who I do know in real life - Julie and Alice, Keith and a couple other people who I don't interact with enough to see their features, so I can’t describe them or give them names. We are on a daytrip to an island. For our entertainment, we have each brought a guitar. I have mine, although I don’t take it out of its pack. Alice has one. Julie is playing something that sounds like a guitar but it has no body, just a neck which looks like a broom handle with a string that goes from one end to the other and acts like a guitar strap so you can put it around the back of your neck. She’s playing a non-existent fretboard. Her hands go up and down the broom handle making guitar-like sounds. When Alice brings hers out I comment that I didn’t realize she could play the guitar. She says she’s been playing for some time. It’s a sunny day - the skies are blue, it’s pleasant and balmy. The waters are a bit choppy but it’s not alarming in any sense, so everybody is kind of relaxed. The woman with the dark hair in a bun says we’ll be arriving in a couple of hours so just continue what we’re doing which is playing songs. Alice is leading the song. She plays the first fret, second fret, then up to fourth fret in bar chords. I get my guitar out and using the same fretboard pattern I begin to pick out a melody. At one point she stops me, corrects me and tells me that she’s playing a finger pattern with E Major with the first index finger barring the strings on the first, second and fourth fret. I tell her that’s exactly what I was doing. She sits back down. We eventually get close to the island. The woman with the dark hair bun tells us we’ll be there in a few minutes, so we all start stowing away what we’ve got out and putting it into our packs so w (...)",

There are ten doors. I’ve had to climb up about eight steps to do this. It’s cement and the doors are simply glass. I walk in the front of the mall and stand there feeling both overwhelmed by the sheer number of stores and floors as well as a little bit of anxiety about whatever it is that I need enough that I have ventured in here. There is also a sense that I have a time limit. So I start to walk towards the foyer. I’m looking for one of those big information signs that has the arrow that says “you are here” and lists the index of all the stores, but I don’t see one. Because I’m still looking, I’m getting further and further into the mall. I notice that three quarters of the stores aren’t even open. The ones that are, are more of a generic type of palette - the way a Dollar Store would have an eclectic variety of carts and things with brightly colored things crammed into every nook and cranny of the store, but not in an enticing way, but in a fluorescent this really hurts my eyes kind of way. I start to look and get really close to the windows and the glass doors of the ones that are not open. I look and see what they’re offering. They’re all specialty shops. Each store that’s just dedicated to clothing has clothing of a certain style. I note with some interest that I have an appreciation for some of these styles as the fabric looks durable yet light, the styles allow for some free flowing movement of the body.

As I come out, my brain kicks in again and tells me to remember the healing images. As I wake up, the healer says: “Tend to your masculine energy child. Look up Libra moon. That’s what you need for healing.” I did a deep healing breath as he finished his hand motions - in both my sleep in my dream and my sleep in real life. I woke up in that position - lying on my right side. I had a sense he was removing an energetic entanglement.",

I did something which ended up turning off some lights in the main auditorium but it wasn't a big deal because they had already been having issues P. M. was trying to fix. He showed me the device for controlling sound, and then a small white circular device with pins that could be pushed up and down and then locked into place. Each pin represented a light in the church. I played around with the device and found it to be finicky. We figured out that if you pushed the pins down halfway and locked them that it was more stable.   I sat down to watch the service and P. M. moved behind me and began brushing my hair. When he had finished I could tell that he had done something strange to my hair. I thought it might be a ponytail, but alas it was four pigtails. I was a bit embarrassed but decided that I would embrace it and not remove them. I went and sat down next to L. D. Davidson who was sitting next to her boyfriend. For some reason I pulled out my phone on which I used the password \"hard.com\" which was a bit odd and inappropriate. I wanted to get rid of the boyfriend. We moved and sat with our backs against the wall. L. D. did not seem very interested in her boyfriend.",

A helicopter had landed in front of me and I gingerly approached, ducking my head to avoid getting hit by the blades though rationally I knew they were too high. The men around the helicopter laughed that I didn't have enough control to make myself stand up straight when I knew it was safe. They weren't jeering or anything bad natured. I walked over to a second helicopter and this time did not duck.  They were offering rides where one would put on a harness and be dragged behind the helicopter trusting the pilot to not let you get tangled in the blades. The contraption had wheels so that you could make a safe landing. I considered going for it and think I would have, but first I watched someone else. The chopper took off and he went soaring. As the chopper banked hard to the right he was thrown off to the left. The chopper made a circle and touched down again. The guy behind slammed into the ground but made tha landing without any issue. In my mind's eye however I could see someone hitting the ground, tipping over, and being knocked unconscious.",

Before it was a lot more spacious with only two big beds in each of the rooms. Now there are five smaller beds in one room and women are getting settled in their beds. I go in with my son and we say hello. He climbs up on the different beds. I recognize one person as a patient of mine in waking life. We go into a room we’ve stayed in before. Instead of two beds, this room now has four. I look for mine. I see my friend Dee. People are talking about the pluses and minuses of this new situation. It’s less expensive at least. We go downstairs to a packing and shipping operation. We are being forced into this labor. It’s a Facebook meets Amazon thing. The man is showing us what we need to do. A crane is lifting a huge heavy box filled with rubber masks. It brings it to a truck to be shipped. Now we are all made to sit at our stations and are then given a box of cardboard envelopes. We are supposed to open the box and remove the ten envelopes. I open an envelope, stuff it with a rubber mask and a flyer with the image of an American flag, then lick the flap, seal it closed and put it in another box. We are all doing this. I’m nearly done with my box when I get to an envelope that is deformed. The flap is difficult to open - it’s wrinkled and torn. Once I put the mask in the envelope, I have a really hard time closing it and sealing it. I’m concerned that they’ll come by and look at my work and my work will be unacceptable. I have a sense of my grandmother’s presence for a bit, but then she moves on. They do come by and give me this look and make a note on their clipboard, so now I’m being watched more carefully. Then we are ushered over to a grassy hill, like an outdoor amphitheater. I see Dee again. I also see John Friend sitting on the grass with a couple young women on either side. The women have these sour judgmental looks on their faces.  (...)",

We were just making it to the end of our journey and were about to head back. It was evening and we traveled along a small road through hills and into a forest.   It immediately grew dark as we were now on the opposite side of the ridge from where the sun was setting. We turned around and began to return the way we came. We were talking and as we rode, we were joined by a girl on a moped or bicycle. When we joined up with her, we noticed that it became light again, which was odd because though we had crosses back to the light side if the ridge, it was now too light to explain by ordinary means.  We continued and at the bottom of a steep hill we realized that our bike and moped were back at the top and were going to pick up speed as they went down. We got them and I jumped back on and rode along with the girl. We were going fast now, full throttle, and the scenery was beautiful and lit by the tired glow from the setting sun. I discussed with the girl my plans to hike the trail but only walking for 3 tok 5 hours a day so that I would have time to write. To our right were clouds and one giant round cumulus cloud was shaped into a perfect face. I stopped the party and pointed it out. I was worried that it was only I who saw the face, but the girl exclaimed that it was indeed a perfect face. The face dissolved until all that was left was a single eye staring at us.  We moved on and I no longer remember the girl being with us. We entered a town which was 20 miles from the NoC which was a further 20 miles from where our parents were. It was a trail town and we secured lodging at a fancy hostel. Our room had a lower and upper area, though we wondered if the lower area was shared. William wanted to bike ahead and meet up with our parents, but when I told him it was 40 miles, I was able to persuade him against it.",

It’s like an aluminum rowboat with a tiller to steer the motor from - it’s probably just a really long handle that extends from the motor. I’m in there with two other people - one that is unidentified and the other is Ellen. We’re navigating through the water heading somewhere. We navigate once where the waters are regular, not rough, and it’s still nighttime. Basically, we’re just motoring straight forward for an hour, then we have to arc around some small clumps of land. We arc around to the left and motor for another little while. In the dream, we’re supposed to get off but what happens is when we complete that, we start again, only this time instead of Ellen at the motor, I’m at the motor. When I’m at the motor, the water is super shallow and it’s tricky to navigate through. I’m worried that we’re going to scrape the bottom and we’ll be stuck. It really looks that way especially when we arc around to the left - I can actually see that the water i smud instead of water on land. Despite this, after we arc around to the left, the boat keeps going but a bit more slowly. I can feel the anxiety and tension in my grip on the motor and in the muscles in my body. We make it. The boat stops and all three of us get out. We walk up a dock and into a cottage that’s very dark and damp. All three of us are exhausted. We go to our assigned rooms. Mine is nearer to the living room. When we walk in, it opens up into a living room and again off to the left is a hallway with bedrooms. My bedroom is the one closest to the living room. The bedrooms are very simple. Everything is very rudimentary here - all that’s in there is a single bed and a small nightstand. It’s kind of dingy and actually doesn’t feel very clean to me.

They look like natural pools insofar as if no one is in the water, the organic material will settle down to the bottom and you’ll be able to see it through the water.

We all wanted flying but the older people got, the less they valued it. There was a large, though not unattractive, lesbian woman with us who was already flying. In this place, people could test out their desired powers.  We went for a walk and were immediately on the lawn of the Richards. It was a well maintained yard with thich, evenly cut grass. Their large White House was in front of us. I felt uncomfortable about being in their yard.  We all approached their house and coming to a window close to the front of the house, everyone but me climbed through the window. I went around to the front door and waited for them to open it for me.  When I entered I walked into the living area and down a short hall to the kitchen where my mother was speaking with Mrs. Richards and a middle aged woman. I stood around not knowing what to say. I walked further down the hall and entered a large bar room where my dad spoke with a young man with long black hair. He had been called into the service of the green berets where his main job was to sing in their socially distanced choir. He looked strong and I wondered if I could take him.",

My one friend who is in the middle of leaving her partnership is with me. She’s the nearest to me. The other friends are more in the background. We are getting on boats in the ocean. I don't know where we’re going. The founder of Astrology Hub which is a service I pay for is also there. I don’t know what she’s doing. I think she’s leading this excursion adventure we’re going on. There’s a big cruise ship that everyone is getting on and then there are some smaller fishing boats that can go quickly and are pretty open but can only sit about five or six people. My friend who’s leaving her partner gets on a fishing boat with me. The captain of the boat is an older man in his fifties or sixties, grey haired, pot bellied, white dude. He’s excited to be driving us “two pretty ladies around” - his words. He is really fawning over my friend. She’s leaning into this free and single thing now. He’s letting her drive the boat but she doesn't let her drive. It’s kind of stormy. The waves are high, the skies are grey, it’s raining. We’re on the boat that doesn’t have a roof, so we’re going to get wet, but everyone on the cruise ship will be fine and dry. There are cameras around and this is being filmed or recorded. I’m watching another friend do a spiel for the cameras, but I can’t hear what she’s saying. There is a hustle and bustle as everyone gets on the boats. So we start to head out into the ocean and the old guy is letting my friend drive. My friend is loving it and saying, “I’m so free!” The wind is blowing in her hair and she’s so excited and so happy. I’m sitting in the back and am like, “Yes, you are totally free right now, but it feels like the pendulum is swinging the other way.” At one point I look over and she’s making out with this old guy who is not her type and kind of gross. She’s like twenty years younger than him. I remember going thro (...)",

    "text": "“The Hanson Family Home” I am at a picnic table outside near the side of a road. There are two picnic tables. Although we can’t see the cars driving by from this area, I know we’re right beside a highway. There’s a gravel shoulder at the edge of a big road on one side of us. There’s a rough grassy area that’s speckled with dirt and gravel; there’s not very much growing there, just a little bit of grass. These two picnic tables are angled in an L-shape. There's a really rough structure, like what you’d find at a really old gas station store, but there are no gas pumps. So I’m sitting there and we’ve got some kind of meal. We’re evaluating whether or not this thing you sit in can be seen or noticed. One looks like a bathtub and the sides are copper, but it’s copper coating over enamel and the copper is being used to disguise it; the edges are probably about fourteen inches. There’s another one where the edges do not come up so high and they are only about six inches tall, but there’s a lip around the outside. It’s also been copper coated. We’re sitting in them on top of the picnic table bench. The other people at the table (not in the tubs) are saying whether or not this is noticeable. We think the shorter one will be less noticable. As it turns out, when we get a good look at them and people are sitting in them, the one that goes up fourteen inches kind of hugs your rib cage and sits under your armpits and because of the copper color, blends in with what people are wearing. You can’t really notice anyone is sitting in it as they’re eating. Whereas the other one has that big lip that sticks out and it’s a vast color difference between the tub and the people’s bodies and the shape of it is unnatural. So, we’re reporting back that the shorter one is not a good disguise. Then the scene changes and we’re in the Hanson’s house, only there is hardly any furniture in it and in some rooms, there’s none. The parents are there. The mom especially is more visible than the dad bu (...)",

He has spandex shorts and a top, mud-spattered calves and thighs and a bit on his rear, not real thickly but some. His arms were at little longer than normal, and reach to his knees. Then I look up, and there's an extraordinary cascade of staircases covered in glazed tile, quite ornate. It's beautiful. A number of staircases side-by-side, narrowing towards the bottom, with big balustrades separating them. Carved heads of lions and other animals made a stunning visual rhythm. It was all a light chestnut brown. Above it rose a series of elegant bay-windowed buildings. I'm very impressed and like it all very much. Then I'm in a hallway in one of the building, above the stairs. The pattern of rich ornamentation continues. A group of Rosicrucians comes the other way. They are all or nearly all women, all wearing white robes and led by a very enthusiastic and smiley woman in early middle age, her short blond hair done in a peculiar manner. She's leading them in some chant that I took to be in nonsense syllables or a pretend or putative ancient language. They're all very enthusiastic and smiley. It was far too organized and gung ho for me. But then, I reflect that you have to go through these forms to engage with life, etc. You can't just sit it all out. This caused me to be less judgmental. I try to follow a stairway down to get back outside and it gets steeper and steeper, and turns into a stairway and gets narrower and steeper yet, and seems to lead to a vertical shaft. There are statues in the shaft that block most of it, in the form of greco-Roman giants trying to get out. I had to give up trying to go out that way.",

They're lovely, very stylistic illustrations. All glossy. One page was impressionistic, overlapping tree shapes, dappled sunlight, autumnal. The women are very earnest but pleasant. I say to them, that's so beautiful, I think I'm going to cry. What I meant was I was touched by it, but they seemed offended. I say, I wrote one novel. They are unfazed, no curiosity. I think, okaaayyy... Then a bunch of university students arrive, and they're going to be there temporarily. The house has very few rooms and is now very crowded. Each one is full of people. I'm wondering, when did I agree to this? I vaguely recalled some conversation with Megan in which I understood these girls would move in, but were are they going to go, now that they're here? No hope of any personal space for me, or for anyone. At one point a young man with an exaggerated physique, overdeveloped upper body, no shirt, medium length black hair and a bit of a beard, is very smiley and squeezes past me in a hallway. I think, dude, I don't want to see your man boobs. Exaggerated nipples. I was repulsed. A relief to wake up.",

I get there and am with a friend, a female friend. We’re sitting on a bench outside of the office. There’s a parallel line up, not part of the ear clinic but beside it where people are lined up to pay their gas bill. Their line up goes all the way down the sidewalk, wraps around the bottom of the hill where the traffic lights are and continues down the other side of the road and around the buildings then vanishes out of sight. I comment that if it weren’t traffic, the line would be graceful as it wraps around the urban setting. I comment to my friend that what we’re looking at is the demographic of people who don’t believe in paying their bills online or don’t trust banks. She makes some kind of argument but I can’t remember what it is now. I debate back that yes, I see your point but we’re still looking at that demographic. I try and study it. I'm looking at the pole., their faces, what they’re wearing, and trying to listen to snippets of their conversation. It’s mostly elderly people. But there’s also a middle aged group of scruffy looking men. I notice millennials there as well. Then our number gets called and we enter the ear clinic. We have another line up in there. It’s now 11:30am and my appointment was scheduled for 8. I’m starting to get hungry and feel frustrated. Then it’s 3pm. I’m still not there. There are about four people ahead of me and I know the clinic closes at 5. I approach the desk and say, “My appointment was at 8. It’s 3pm. I’m really getting tired and hungry and thirsty. What's going on?” The receptionist who looks like my son’s counselor crawls underneath the desk and speaks to me from there. She says, “I’m really sorry. This isn’t by my design. People get upset by this all the time. They do this every time. Everyone’s appointment was scheduled for 8am.” I feel like screaming at her but I don (...)",

She was complaining about the popcorn that she had bought as there was a problem with it. However she was not speaking coherently and no one could understand what she meant. A manager came over with some complaint forms on a clipboard. It didn't matter because while she kept talking her language was completely unrelated to her problem. She spoke of oil and kept making tangents and describing bizarre things. I began to suspect her of mental illness and began to study her face closely. I was looking down at her as if I were floating above her. She looked my way and almost noticed that I was watching. She kept rambling and the workers were at a loss. I thought about telling them that she was psychotic and that they should just send her away. I approached the checkout counter and pulling out a small piece of paper wrote down something about psychosis in blue ink. I thought about asking the woman if she had a mental illness or if she had stopped taking her meds.",

I’m trying to wrap it around my neck in an elegant way, but look quite awkward. We thought we were early, but as we try to find our seats, we have trouble finding five in a row. There are some openings for four seats, but not five. The chairs are plush red velvet. We’re walking up the aisle looking for a spot. People are saving empty seats with clothing and other items. We have to walk pretty far away from the stage to find a row, but eventually do. We file in and I take note of the people around us. After the show, which I don’t recall, we go out to a balcony. A man joins me. He is a little creepy. He puts headphones on me. He also has a set. He plays a short meditation on his iphone. I’m supposed to drop in and have a consciousness altering experience. But I’m worried about what his ulterior motive might be. Then some light dance music comes on. I’m still somewhat listening but others come out on the deck and I’m wanting to interact with them. A man talks to the creepy guy about his coaching program. I somehow see a digital display of this program. It’s based on the life, death and rebirth of Jesus. I comment on transformation as a moment of life and how it relates to Jesus’ death on the cross. I’m quite intrigued by the life design coaching program and want to know more. A tidal wave is coming, but people are in the ocean, on the beach, and standing on the balcony nearby watching unconcerned. We’re trying to warn them so they survive. I climb up onto a wooden lifeguard stand with some other people. We are looking out at a crowd. There is some kind of trial or judgement happening. They pass a microphone up to us on the stand. The creepy man who is maybe not so creepy anymore is up on the stand. He hides his face so they won’t recognize him as he speaks in favor of the person being judged. (...)",

The displays are all empty. I walk into one of them and am trying to show Josh and the other guy, maybe he’s my brother, that your eyesight is limited from the point of view of the animal. I’ve walked into the display area and am looking out to where the crowds would be standing. I say, “See you can only see so much if you’re in here.” I try to show them this. Then I turn around and it’s like there’s an inside part of these displays that opens up into a huge cylinder shaped room that opens up to the sky. Inside are more cages and laboratories and places for the animals. I want to explore this. The other two come in with me. We’re curious. We don't know exactly what is happening in this area of the zoo. I still can’t see any animals. Except, as I get closer, I’m looking at a lot of metal and cages and fluorescent lights. As I’m looking, these tiny, maybe three inches tall, koala bears show up. They’re climbing this little bird stand with the wide dish at the bottom for bird seed. There isn't a cage around it, though. The tiny koalas are hyper and all over the place. This scientist zoologist comes out with a black house cat (his familiar?) and I’m like, “Oh my gosh! I want to hold this tiny koala!” The scientist says, “Don’t touch the tiny koala. They’re on something. I don’t know what they might do to you. They might bite you. They might scratch you. So just leave them alone.” So I just look at them. At first there was one, then there were two, then there were like fifty of them swarming this little stand. They are moving kind of crazily. I back up a little bit. We’re just poking around this inside place and looking for other animals. I get a sense that there are other things we could be doing than this. The scene changes.

I fly south, floating along, lots of big, densely packed industrial buildings just beyond Pioneer Square. I move in that direction and enter a building where there is some complex industrial operation going on with a huge reciprocating saw thing in the rear. I move towards it to get a better look, but by the time I get there it has changed. I rise upwards and have no trouble with altitude. Perfect control. I float through the roof, no resistance, and get a view of the city. Oddly, when I pass through the roof I come out several miles north of downtown, but am not aware of any incongruity. Adam is present, as a late adolescent. Am I carrying him at one point? I'm introducing him to flying, telling him how great it is. It changes. A building, sort of agricultural (?), some kind of western thing, all men but not gay. I've floated through layers of this other building and am on the roof. A gathering, not too large. Very pleasant. Two guys sitting, looking very much alike, could have been twins. Western shirts, blue jeans. Just sitting there, smiling. Now I'm having difficulty passing through walls. I can't make it all the way through. I'm not stuck, I can pull back out, but I can't get through. A very dirty refrigerator, empty, very old, stained and nasty. Lots of cookies there on a table, and I scarf them up, even as I think, diabetes, eek! Someone's home. I don't know them. A buffet. Cheeses, meats, I come across some very fatty ham, more than half fat. I put a few pieces on my plate, then I see some deli chicken and turkey. Most of it is gone. I'm a little late to this party.

It used to have the Central Hotel on it. I’m around the area where that hotel used to be but it doesn’t look like that now. There’s an open area. None of the stores that used to be ther are there. It’s just grass and an amphitheatre. Then as you move towards the main street, those stores stay there and there are two areas within that block that are associated with the amphitheatre and grassy area - it’s some kind of daycare. As the dream opens and I see this physical setting, I am to go to each of the three areas. My shift begins with spending fifteen minutes in each one so that one of the two staff can have their fifteen minute break, then I am to have the rest of my shift in one continuous place. First I start in the amphitheatre. The kids are older, maybe 6-8 years old. They’re building something out of wood. I have a really big giant cardboard box that’s really sturdy. I don’t know what would have been in it, maybe an adult car, it’s that big. It’s on its side and they’re putting the pieces of lumber in it. I don’t really know what they’re building but they’re quite busy with it. They’re sprinkling some bits of cut grass into it and they’re quite industrious. I just supervised from afar to make sure they’re playing safely with the lumbar and no one is getting their fingers pinched or hurt. That fifteen minutes goes by. The staff I relieved comes back. I walk around the corner and go into one of the buildings that looks like a store but is a daycare room with younger children. It’s a mixed group of boys and girls and it’s a little less organized. Whereas, the boys were working together on their creation outside, this is more chaotic and the kids are running from center to center. There isn’t the collective community that I felt in the outdoor space. I’m not really sure what I’m supposed to be supervising but agai (...)",

We’re wandering around and we find this office with all of the gear we would need to get on the spaceship, fly it, and head to the moon. So we’re collecting all this stuff. It’s stuff that the other astronauts who have already been to the moon have used. It’s their things. We’re collecting it because we’re going to go.

Other cars are using this too, going fairly rapidly, including a little robot vehicle going by itself, that is very small and stubby, yellow. I don't want to go fast at all, but there's someone behind me. I pull over and stop. We get out of the car. When I look a the car., it isn't the one we'd been in before. It's a little, stubby, grey sedan from the late '60's or early '70's, some rental car. Megan can't find her keys. Finally she does find them. I start explaining to her that we're dreaming right now. I recognize that the pattern of events,like the car getting swapped out, couldn't be real.",

My childhood home was on a really busy street and I would often see people that I knew drive by and some people would stop by if we were outside in the front. We were sitting at a picnic table on the corner and some people started trickling in from my past and it was like a block party. There was food and people were singing karaoke I think or call in response and the party kept going until the evening. This girl that I don’t know who kind of looks like Avril Lavigne but more severe came through. Everyone really liked her and she was very charismatic and kind of abrupt, but in a way that was charming. She started singing and then into the evening she started singing worship songs like Jesus church songs. I was like what is this? I wasn’t down but everyone was immediately down and then at the end of the evening she pulled me and Bea aside and started talking about her funeral. We didn’t know her so we asked, “Oh are you like terminally ill?” and she’s like, “No, but I plan to die tonight.” Again I’m shook, but Bea seemed fine. She proceeded to tell us that she wanted us to sacrifice her to absolve humanity of its burdens and sins, like she was the second coming of Christ - she didn’t say that but that was the vibe. I didn’t want to do it but everyone else seemed totally down to do it. I also didn’t believe her that she wanted to do that. I kind of thought that maybe she was suicidal but because she was so religious she couldn’t kill herself so she needed somebody else to do it, so she was using the situation to her advantage to get into heaven. We turned on the incinerator which for some reason was in my backyard and prepping for the sacrifice. I asked her what she wanted her story to be when people were investigating this act and she said that no one would find out that it happened so there wouldn’t be an investigation and then I woke up.",

I get ready but find a mottled, white, black, and brown kitten. I debate whether I should help it or ignore it. I realize that the responsible thing is to help it. It is friendly and as I'm petting it I see that across from me a door to an apartment is open. I also see another black cat , and possibly a third black and white one and I assume they came from that apartment. I knock on the door and ask if the cats are theirs. A woman responds that they are and I gather the kittens together and shove them through the door.  Later we are all hanging out and talking outside of the apartments. It is crowded and everyone is milling about. I begin to suspect my sister of plotting to kill my brother. She has given him a bag of smarties which I am sure are poisoned. He eats some before I can stop him. I then take the smarties and act as if I am going to eat some as well to see how my sister will react. She didn't seem overly bothered so I ate some assuming that they would not be deadly.",

Someone who works there takes my jacket and hangs it up for me. I go to sit down at a table. I’m supposed to meet people there. As I sit down, I realize that everyone is meeting there prior to moving next door for a wedding. I take my seat and am scanning the room for people I know. I don’t see anyone I know. I just sit in the seat. I’m waiting until we are going to be notified that we’re moving. Then it seems rather sudden that someone from the hotel circulates through the guests telling them it’s time to move. They’re saying things that cause us to be hasty and move quickly and not to linger. I get up and move with the flow of the crowd. We exit out the front door and immediately take a left and go into the door beside it, then up a long set of stairs and into a big room. The room we just left was crowded and stuffy but had kind of a homey atmosphere - the decor was of wood with wood posts that held the ceiling up and it had that well oiled hand hewn feel to it. This upstairs room is just one big rectangle that’s maybe hastily put together. No one sits and stays for a long time. It remains empty. There’s no warmth when you walk in. There's a long table. I don’t know if I’m supposed to sit here. Again, I’m scanning the room for people I know. I see two people who used to live in my neighborhood and I thought were my friends. They know I’m there but keep to themselves and make no effort to come talk to me. I seem to know the people I’m sitting with but I can’t identify them in the dream. I realize we’re here for a reception. The servers bring food out. Everybody has the same plate of food. We eat without gusto. The servers take the food away and place dessert on the table.

We made our way through a building, waited around a bit for the event to start, and eventually entered a small room where I and my brother found a place to sit on the floor. A few elements from Halo were in the dream and I remember tossing a grenade or two at some people to annoy them. Then someone accused me of throwing a grenade which I had not and I defended myself by claiming that I was out of grenades as I had thrown them all. Then people started voting on who the culprit was so that they could remove them. I remained silent and the voting came to nothing.  The trivia began and it was all Star Wars related. At first I was worried because I thought I didn't know much about Star Wars but then I realized that I had seen the movies a lot and should know as much as anybody. The first question was about which movie something occurred in and the answer was The Empire Strikes Back.

The things we’ve stacked around the sleeping area - our belongings - give us just enough privacy.

    "text": "“Grief and Ash” I’m having a conversation with a woman that continues despite the fact that I need to use the washroom. It continues despite the fact that I’m sitting on the toilet and pushing something out of my body. I’m pushing shit out of my body. I don't have to strain too hard. My body does evacuate it pretty effortlessly. I can hear other people in the house but it’s more like white noise rather than distinct conversation. Then the person I’m talking to continues talking about mundane topics as though I’m not sitting on the toilet and I’m not evacuating shit from my body. I can feel my body is finished. Then I take the toilet paper from the roll on the wall, nothing unusual. As I try and wipe the remnants of it from myself, it feels like there’s gritty stuff like seeds. I wipe again. Now instead of there being less on the paper, there’s more. I repeat this process about six times. There’s more each time. I feel like it’s spreading it around the cheeks of my bum. And so, I think that this process is spreading it around me more. I don’t want to continue it. I need to go somewhere else where I can get clean. I tell the woman, “I can’t talk to you right now. I need to stop this.” She does leave. I take off all my clothes and get into the shower. I scrub myself from head to toe. I realize that the shower, the water, the soap is making me clean. I stop, rinse myself off and get out. I towel myself off. I feel clean now. But I’m disgusted at my clothes. I think they carry something. I put them in the washing machine in the bathroom, add some soap, turn the water on and start them. Then the dream continues on. I just can’t pull any more out of it.",

There are some flat spaces but also lots of places to climb. The trees are more like evergreen trees; they’re conifers. I don’t recall any deciduous trees at all. I’m with some people. We are tasked with finding these red marks. Each red mark indicates that there’s something hidden there and we have to follow the instructions or use the thing that’s hidden for the purpose that it’s hidden for. There is a bit of gathering as we get into very small groups of just one or two people. Some people are going off on their own. At the bottom of the hill is some kind of night vision glass that if you look through it, you can see where the red marks are. You can’t see the marks unless you’re looking through the glass. So, you have to remember where they are then start to weave your way up the hill and climb over the rocks, sometimes on hands and knees. Some of it is really steep and people are grabbing onto immature trees to help pull themselves up. We don’t have any equipment. We’re wearing clothes and we have to figure out how to navigate through the landscape on our own. Then once you get there, you just feel around with your hand or look with your eyes to discern if there’s some item that’s not natural. Some of them are tricky. For example, one of the items is simply some food. So where the red dot was is a piece of fish food then close by to where it was found, the rock is like a mouth of a cave. We crawl in. Really close to the mouth of the cave is a deep, deep pool. There’s a large fish in there, probably about three feet long and has teeth. What’s the natural food you do with fish food if there’s a fish? Feed it. So, the person that I’m with feeds the fish. I think she better get her hand back quickly because that fish has a lot of rows of pointy teeth and it’s a carnivorous fish. She does. She feeds it (...)",

I’m picking up speed and running then flying over the ocean. I’m catching the wind and feeling free, but also realize the break is almost over and I need to get back to class quickly. I am skimming over the ocean, feeling the splash of the salt water. At first I’m going out to sea, then I catch the wind under my arms. A big wave is coming and I catch it. I’m surfing flying the wave like a pelican. I can feel the momentum and it’s exhilarating. It takes me right next to a rock face and between a narrow crevice of rocks. I can see the water rise as the wave and I approach. It’s as if time slows so I can precisely fly through this narrow area without catching the sides of the rocks. I make it to shore and return to the classroom. The desks have been rearranged. They are set up closer together. I recall having a conversation with a woman before break about where to sit. She’s a young Asian woman and reminds me of a Biology Major and Pre-Med student at Stanford University. We will be sitting next to each other at the back of the classroom. I arrive before she does and see her notebooks stacked on a chair. I move them over one so that my chair is closest to the professor’s desk. Other people are coming in now and finding their desks. The young Asian woman comes to sit next to me in the back. I get up and push the desks around so they aren’t so cramped together. She has just voted for the president. She is talking with me about how Edward has been communicating with her about upcoming projects and he’s looking to hire someone new at the end of October. I’m concerned that my work will be done and a new intern will come in. I’m uneasy about this. Then more students come in. The woman is yelling at the students and taunting them about not voting.

The building's exterior was quite as in reality, but there was more room around it. An entrance to a parking garage on the third ave side, and on the uphill side there was an extensive paved area for parking and another entrance to the parking garage. I had parked my car outside in the parking area there, where there was a motley collection of dumpsters, odd bits and random vehicles When I come out, my car is gone. I'm worried that it has been towed for some parking violation. Was I supposed to have paid? Was the spot reserved? Then follows a very long sequence of trying to find my way to the upper entrance of the parking garage so I can ask someone if my car had been towed. Complicating matters, I don't have my phone. I'd left it at home. I'm stumped. And I can't find that entrance. I go from being outside to inside, and it's quite extensive, with blind alleys, sudden drop-offs, and large, rectangular holes. Fortunately everything is well lit, but there are no signs or warnings. At one point I seem to be outside, looking for the lower entrance, having given up on trying to find the upper. Going down some exterior stairway which also ends in a drop off, only six feet or so, but nothing you'd have in reality. Something about another guy there.... At another point I'm inside, and I realize I have no shoes on. There's a pair of shoes there that are too big for me, of very soft leather lined with lamb's wool.

I see a very pregnant woman about to go into labor. They hurry her to a hospital. I’m looking at her and horrified by the idea of giving birth with a mask on. I couldn’t even wear earrings when I was giving birth. People disperse in an unremarkable way. Later in the dream, some guys are building a carnival playset with pipes. You climb up the pipes, do some athletic exercises at the top, then go down the slide. They remove some of the stations on the top part so that it’s not quite as challenging and people can go up, stand and look out, then go down the slide. A strong burly guy climbs up. He does pull ups at the top, then slides down. I notice that he is a bit wider than the slide. The contraption isn’t entirely ready, but they let him test it out. I wonder if they should add some rings for swinging. They aren’t meeting any safety regulations and I can see that a person could lose their balance at the top and fall to the ground if they do too much.",

    "text": "“Gutting the Backpack - Lucid Dream” This is one of those lucid dreams where you just close your eyes for a moment and your body is rooted down despite the fact that you feel like you want to get up and move. I’m suddenly standing rooted on the side of a road. Suddenly a man appears and leaps over the shoulder and yanks something out from the forest at the side of the road. The forest goes right to the shoulder. He pulls out something that I at first think is an animal. And all in one second, he takes a knife out of his pocket and he guts it, making a long sharp blade from the top to the bottom. The contents spill out the way people do when they gut a shark and tires and all that kind of stuff from the bottom of the ocean that ends up in the belly of a shark pulls out on the side of the road. There’s liquid or digestive juices with it. I’m horrified for a moment, then I think: “Wait a minute, that’s not an animal, that’s a backpack!” The things that came out of it are equipment, like flashlights, a little rope and cans of emergency food. It’s a survival kit. But it was gutted. He didn’t open it with a zipper.",

We’re in the auditorium that reminds me of my high school auditorium that I was in a lot for dances, plays and assembly every Friday or Monday morning. It’s an intimate venue because the auditorium is pretty small, so Dane Cook is pretty close. There are a bunch of other people in the auditorium; they are all men and I am the only woman. They’re all wearing plaids or flannels, all different colors, including Dane Cook. I'm sitting next to Josh and laughing because it is funny, it is a comedy show. It’s kind of short. He finishes his set and all the other guys in the audience go up on stage and swarm him. Everybody is very complimentary, telling him what a good job he’s done. I’m just sitting in the back wondering why everyone is in plaid flannels and why it’s all men, just a big sausage fest. The term “sausage fest” is the kind of thing Dane would say in his comedy. I’m a little confused as to why I’m the only female in the room. Dane gets off the stage because he’s finished with the set. He’s heading up to the sound booth. Josh calls him over to introduce him to me. It is an awkward moment for me because Dane Cook definitely takes the time to go out of his way and say hi. I wonder why he would come over to say hi. Josh says, “Well, because you’re gorgeous and he wants to talk with you.” I’m like, “Well, whatever!” I’m not impressed that a celebrity is wanting to talk with me - that sounds right in real life, too!

We’re leaving the house for an errand. A family has moved into our apartment with us and has brought all their kitchen supplies including a large cast iron pan, a whole collection of knives, spatulas, spoons and other things. Before we left, I was making an egg on a pan with a non-stick surface. Whenever I stepped out of the kitchen, the mom came and moved my egg to the cast iron. I moved it back and she moved it again. It was really irritating and I wanted them out. I couldn’t imagine blending our households. So I left. We are dropping off her husband so he can pick up more things. He’s aware of her controlling ways in the household and especially in the kitchen. He’s silent and apologetic in his silence. We drop him off at a house in another neighborhood. Then my husband drops me off at a gym for a class. Other women are sitting on the street waiting for them to open. I lean my chiropractic table against a garage door. Behind the garage door are supplies for the dance and exercise classes. I can see numbers that tally the equipment to help keep track of it all when people use them for classes and return them later. A woman comes to sit beside me. She recognizes me and offers me a drink from her flask. I take it then the teacher comes and opens the doors. We all go inside and are all tipsy. The class begins but it is disorganized. It’s kind of like an adult gymnastics class and it feels like a gym I used to go to when I was younger - balance beams, parallel bars, tumbling floor and vault. A woman who identifies herself as Tiffany (I don’t know her from waking life) invites me to her family’s home after class. I go with her. Her aunt is sitting in the backseat and we are going to visit her mom, Norma.",

My belongings are in a suitcase tucked under the back bed and there is always something else on top of it or beside it, and always some waiting for someone else to get their things out first, so I can get to mine. It’s really cramped. Everything always seems rushed. I’m supposed to be hosting some kind of group discussion and I’ve been planning it for some time. There’s about twenty people involved and a certain day that it happens. In my dream, today is the day. I’m trying to use the washroom and get my clothes out, but there’s always someone else in there. I’m starting to feel rushed and I’m going to be late. I have this other book satchel that I brought on the trip and it had all the things I needed for the group discussion. It was all organized and I put it in there before the trip. There were pens I needed and a little tiny laptop and paper and a couple of other things that look like slim books, and they all fit in there nicely. I can’t find this. Someone has moved this. I’m looking for the people in the RV to ask them: “Who moved my thing? Where did you put it? I need it and have to go now.” Then it’s time to go and I can’t find it. So this lady named Maria says, “Here, I have a few pencils and a pad of paper you can use.” I notice that hers have her name on everything. Everything I’m using says Maria.

We’re just having a really wonderful girls time. Joey is not really interacting with us. He seems preoccupied with whatever it is he’s doing that either keeps him outside or always a different room in the house. At some point, we make a meal. That’s when he comes and sits down at the table with us. He looks really withdrawn and quiet. I’m wondering what’s going on with him because he’s not usually like that. After the meal is finished, he leaves again to some other area of the house. Maggie tells me that she and Joey have this symphony to attend a couple hours away. They need to get dressed up for it. She says, “Come and help me decide what to wear. Joey is already ready and he’s wearing a tux.” I know she needs to get dressed up and maybe there will be some “doing of the hair.” I follow her upstairs and we go into a big walk-in closet. She’s got several things that she’s pulled out and is setting them on the bed. Instead of getting dressed, she starts putting the gowns up against me. I don’t think anything of this.

It reminds me of when you open up an avocado that’s too old and the seed has started to sprout and there are all these veiny roots growing out of the seed through the avocado and you don’t want to eat the avocado because it tastes gross. It looks like one of those super veiny things that’s about a half inch in diameter. It’s growing from my heart through my back. He’s showing me the x-ray through my back and I can see my spine. He’s telling me that all of my issues are coming through this growth or deformity, I don’t even know what to call it. He’s telling me that it’s something that has just shown up and wasn’t there before. But now it’s there and it’s making everything not work correctly because it’s growing from my sternum, through my heart, into my spine in the back.

Then it’s almost like the time I spent actually living there is a memory I’m unaware of as I re-enter it. The setting is a cleared area in a forest. The structures are really rustic; they’ve been hand-hewn and erected without machines. Everything has been done by hand. In fact, the floor inside one of the structures, the one I’m in, is made of gravel and wood chips and it’s quite chunky. I’m inside one of these structures in the village and looking out the window. I look at the other structures from the window and think, “Hmm, that’s interesting. When they resurrected this, they put them in a different spot than they originally were.” I notice that the windows aren’t made of glass, but something a little opaque. I’m not quite sure what the material is. I’m inside one of these and it’s definitely the biggest of the structures and has two floors. I don’t go to the upper floor. I’m sitting on something and it’s not really a couch - it’s something stuffed with straw or horse hair. I’ve got a binder with me. I take it out and it’s study notes.

It sounds the way people would whisper when they’re alarmed - the uplifting and more staccato notes of the voices. I hear the word, “snakes.” All of a sudden I realize they must be talking about the two boa constrictors that are normally lazing around in the large tanks at the back of the room behind me in the back row. Without turning around to look to see if they are actually missing, I get up and start looking on the floor. I’m walking really slowly, so as not to alarm the snakes because they’re normally just lie there and not bother anyone as they rarely eat and they sleep a lot.

I see the really long one, it’s longer than the length of the table they’re seated at. It’s snuggled itself up against the baseboard. I’m thinking that if I just quietly go up to their desk and tell them not to be alarmed but they should move slowly and quietly then we can get the snake and return it to its home and this will be fine. Also I didn’t tell anybody else in the classroom because I don’t want a whole bunch of noise and people running around making a whole bunch of vibrations and stampede sounds on the floor.

The town is fairly rustic and very interesting. Some interaction in a little store, a young woman proprietor. A long bit in a library that was also a book store. The books were arranged per Library of Congress catalogue numbers. It was all one large room, with exposed red brick walls. Very old fashioned. I find on a table something from about 1900, some periodical, with a feature or story that I found interesting and wanted to read. I wanted to buy it. I talk to some woman there, who informed me it was a periodical. When I examined it more closely, there were some torn pages. The first twenty pages or so have a piece cut out, not ripped. A hole, covers about a fifth of the page. She mentioned that they may have more of them. I spend quite a bit of time looking. Some question about the numbering. Was it in the 7000 or 1700 series? I realize there is another room. I finally find a young man who tells me that this is the only copy they have. They have no other issues of that periodical. I still want to buy it, but never get around to finding out how much it was, let alone paying for it and walking out with it. I have my car, my actual car.

The road turns to dirt and gets narrower and more rustic, and finally there's a very big puddle, and that's when I realize that I am in fact not on the right road. I leave the car and walk back to the town. I finally find the same store from the beginning of the dream again. Something I was going to buy, or almost bought.

It was still dark in the morning. I thought maybe my dog peed because it smelled like urine in the kitchen and I saw bees in a puddle on the floor. I wanted to get them out of here, so I got a swiffer and a paper towel and thought I killed them (I normally don’t kill bugs; I catch and release). When I turned around they were flying and on my window but they were monarch butterflies. They said they wanted to negotiate something and had reached out to the New York Times. We weren’t talking but communicating. It was amazing. I opened the balcony door and said to go and come back later when my lights were on. One of them said they would do some self care and then come over. Then I woke up.",

My kids are there, I think. I am in an outdoor area and we’re fleeing something. One of the things we’re feeling is snakes. There are snakes everywhere, literally popping up no matter where you turn there’s a snake there. Some are tiny garter snakes and some are those gigantic boa constrictors that you see in the rivers of South America, just huge. We’re in a forest. It’s a forested area, oak not pine trees. I’m getting this weird bird’s eye view of the area. It looks almost like a checkerboard, but each square is different - a couple squares are forest, a couple squares are a complex with metal and barbed wire, and some of the squares are mountains. It’s very segmented landscapes, but the snakes are everywhere. At one point, I’m watching people kill the snakes. I’m not killing them; I’m trying to move them to the side, at least the small ones, and just get out of the way of the big ones. I’m trying to keep the people who are with me - it must be my kids - close to me and out of harm's way, away from the snakes. Most of the snakes are not poisonous - there aren’t a lot of rattlers, but it’s freaky because there are so many snakes. I wake up a little bit, then go back to sleep. Now I’m in another dream. I have my son with me, but he’s little, six or so. We are in a treehouse that overlooks a river. It’s on one side of a bank and the bank is steep - this side is higher than the other side because I can see over the treetops on the other side of the river. There’s a view and it’s very expansive. I’m in the house, but am outdoors. It has an outdoor patio with a huge, deep koi pond. There is a spiral staircase at the center of this outdoor area. My son and I go to walk up the spiral staircase because we are wanting a better view. There are koi fish, seals, and sharks in the pond. The koi fish are vicous as fuck!  (...)",

I'd been staying or living somewhere near Redmond, but in the dream it wasn't called Redmond. Taking the bus involved several transfers. At the mall, we go inside. It's not a very big mall. It centers on one central room with galleria radiating out from it. We quickly become separated, which was not my intention. I briefly see one of the guys, not Friedrich, then lost sight of him. I think to myself, this is stupid, not what I bargained for, and I don't like it. I walk around the mall, observing. Very richly detailed visual scenes. A lot of Christmas stuff going on. I get into an \"observing the natives\" mode. A mother and her children, other people, a lot of glitter and shiny things. Quite nice, but I'm frustrated. I wonder, can I take the bus back home by myself? I hadn't paid much attention to what routes we took coming out, and the transfers were problematic. It would be beyond me. So I take a room in a nearby motel so that I can lie down and rest. It's one room, like a studio apartment. The toilet is in the same room as the bed. When I go to pee in it, I see that it is not clean. Old pee in it. I'm grossed out. The room is very plain and had a desolate feel to it. I'm not entirely sure what I am doing there.",

The third comes and I not only block his attack but manage to injure his horse and force him to dismount. He has a speer and a net on a pole which he uses to catch people's heads and entangle them. He feints for me, then attacks and snags my commander with his net. He pulls him close and twists the net. My commander is trapped.

We have to match five bundles to five names and there is a keycode that goes with it. This has to be done before you can freely join in any of the other games. I was in the social field and then in some way I was alerted or warned that I had to go match these bundles with the keycode. So, I leave. I walk up the field to the table. The little bundles are almost like medicine bundles. They’re pieces of cloth tied with bits of leather. Some of the leather has beads on the end. In addition to the leather tie is a small tag. The keycode is really worn. It’s like a piece of canvas with lists on it. The lists are so worn that they’re really hard to read. I’ve got five of these little medicine bundles. Each one belongs to somebody that’s there. I have to find the name on the keycode, then transfer the keycode onto the little bundle’s tag. The first thing is that the marker doesn’t work on the tag. It seems to work for others, but it’s not working for me. It takes a little figuring and decoding because they aren’t just regular names, there are numbers. You have to translate the numbers, do some math in your head, look on the canvas, count some things, then calculator in your name, then translate this back onto the tag. So, because my marker doesn’t work, I keep forgetting all the calculations in my mind. I am getting really frustrated because it’s not working. Everybody else is going up, finishing tagging and coding their bundles, then going back to the games. So I’m still there. Other people come in. Someone takes the marker. I have to wait and can’t find the canvas legend. The marker doesn’t work. Then everyone is finished except for me and I’m still sitting there. A woman named pauses for a moment f (...)",

The cafe is owned by a friend, a woman, though not somebody I recognize in waking life. I am sort of wandering and stopping to talk with people. I walk through the cafe because I’m meeting people there. Then I go to leave the cafe and get my shoes. I walk through this door and bend down to grab my slippers. There are four pairs of slippers. One of my friends who I’m there to meet - this friend is switching between my friend Beth and a classmate from high school - her face keeps changing. As I bend down to pick up my slippers, she slams the door open onto my head. I don’t know if she did it on purpose or not. My reaction is that she did it on purpose, because I stand up and slam the door back on her. I’m pissed that she has hurt me like this because it was so unexpected and triggered my trauma response which is, “if you hit me, I’m going to hit you back harder.” I do it. Then I’m like, “Oh god!” I still can’t tell whether she did it on purpose or not because she’s very shocked that I slammed the door back on her. But she also has a malicious look in her eye like she got me to do what she wanted me to do, which was to hurt her. Then she goes and tells everyone that I just slammed the door on her. I’m feeling all kinds of shame about it. I walk back into the cafe with the owner who is my friend in the dream realm. I’m trying to explain myself, but I can just feel that I should not have slammed the door on her and hurt her like that. Any words coming out of my mouth sound like a terrible excuse. The cafe itself is very bright and airy. There is a lot of white, lots of big windows. Everyone is hustling and bustling and all the servers are pretty quick. You can hear the clink of glasses and china. There are pastries coming out and coffee being served. So the space itself is pretty bright, but me coming in to say I just did this thing feels very shadowy in comparison. The (...)",

I had my phone in my hand so I pick it up before the first ring is over. I know it’s him even though he’s changed his number, it still pops up as his name. I’m surprised because he had given up his phone. Even though it’s not a video call, I can see him. He’s sitting on an oversized chair. He’s very awkward. He says, “Hey, it’s Jeremy.” I say, “I know. Hi, how are you?” I’m trying to be light. Then he says, “I owe you an explanation.” So then he starts to share. I can’t really hear what he’s saying and then the dream dissolves into nothing. Before this, I’m riding in a wooden wagon with other people over farmland. It had been raining up higher on the hill, but as we are taking the wagon down, I get out and start running. It’s urgent. I’m running through snow. It’s the first snowfall. I go inside. There are other people waiting. I wade into a warm indoor pool. We’re talking about something that happened earlier and two women who've gone missing. As we are talking and wading, the water drains completely. It’s a big pool and I’m surprised that the water has gone out entirely. I wonder if they do this every night to keep the water clean. But because the temperature of the water and air are exactly the same, I didn’t notice that the water has been draining until it’s completely gone. Then we walk up the steps out of the pool. Before that, I’m at dinner. It’s quite loud. I was going to finish teaching a lesson on the element of fire, but we have to delay the lesson because one of the women is planning to call in and will be on video. I don’t think it’s appropriate to have a video call and a loud voice in the restaurant. The dinner breaks up and everyone leaves. There is a sinister feeling and things are not quite right.

The person that cut it, cut it wrong and cut it too close and it looked disgusting. There are ravens and crows in Bernard’s garage. I've been with them a long time and it’s late, so he drives me home. But he’s tired. I forgot that my car is in their garage. He seems slightly annoyed that it’s late and he’s having to drive. He drives on the walls! I freak out and ask him if Carol is okay with this. He’s driving more like a skateboarder kid, so he’s going straight, then he’s going up on the wall and going down and then going up again. He’s acting kind of like a child. Then he falls asleep at the wheel and crashes. But it’s not a major crash. He just lightly hits a wall. I end up having to call for help. Carol is worried. I end up bringing him home. I have to take him upstairs. Then I get in my own car and leave. At some point, I see a silver french bulldog that I used to own in dreamtime, but rehomed it. I keep thinking about getting a dog, but we had a dog once and we rehomed him because he was the neediest dog ever and competing with my daughter for my attention, but the whole point of getting this dog was so that he and my daughter could bond. So I rehomed him. I used to have this french bulldog in the dream, but was like, “Oh, I got rid of it.”",

She has made a deal for her birthday that the time with her daughter will be front loaded to this time of life, so she can get it over with. Somehow, her daughter will grow older faster, while the mom ages at the same rate. So time is expanded in some way. It’s unusual to watch. Now I’m in an airplane and my brother in law is flying it.

We are all getting some kind of training. There’s a woman who puts off some sketchy evil vibes. She is talking with us. We are doing some sort of evaluation but also trained or taught about how to use our superpowers.

I watch her get up and walk around the table with it. It tells her specific things. It points at an Arab student next to me and shakes its head no. She looks at him and tells him to leave because I guess he doesn’t have the power that he needs to have to do the things she wants us to do. So he grabs his extra masks.

One roll of clothing was the black pants, button down shirt and apron that I was supposed to wear for work. The other roll was my pajamas. When I get to work, I pull out my backpack and the pajamas roll is there instead of the work roll. I can’t leave. I don’t have enough time to go back and get my proper clothes and if I don’t work my shift, I’ll lose my job. So I’m forced to go out, feeling vulnerable, unprepared, and setting myself up for ridicule. I go out onto the floor in my pajamas with my apron on, hoping no one will notice. The manager does and I explain what happened. He sends me out onto the floor anyway. Instead of the section I thought I was supposed to have, I’m in another one that’s called the “Bad Lot.” It’s called the “Bad Lot” because no one wants to sit there until the restaurant is all full, and then it just gets slammed. Instead of the five tables that are supposed to be in the “Bad Lot,” there are sixteen! They’re all over the place and they’re all seated at the same time. The pen won’t work. I can’t write down anyone’s orders. All the blank pieces of paper I had now have writing all over them. People are glaring at me; they’re yelling at me. When I go to take a drink order, no one can even make their mind up about what they want to drink. They say they’re ready but they’re actually not.

The steam engines are going fast, and we're pacing them. Then it's a bus. For some reason we're put on a bus, which goes down the highway at quite a good clip.

The bus stops at a bus station, a boxy, concrete-block building next to a parking lot, somewhere in California. You go up a precarious pole — there were normal stairs in back, but everyone goes up the pole, and it's perilous getting from the pole over to the second-floor balcony. Inside is a canteen, but it's all coin-operated, and not one thing there looks appealing. Lot of candy, things I can't eat. I fish around in my pocket and pull out some coins. One looks like a fifty cent piece, but turns out to be something I got in Las Vegas, and has some motto on it in Spanish, something about liberdad or something.

They looked like tiny little aliens but they were children and we realized it was a sweatshop next door. The children are comforting each other and there is an American flag there. It made me sick to my stomach and I kept wondering how we were going to help them and it was really upsetting. We were trying to figure out if we could call the police or call somebody to come in stay at that room so they could see what we are seeing and help these children because we know if we went to just go rescue them we could make it worse",

Now below her shirt is a dragon like creature with blue scales.   Later the girl is taken aside by her red headed sister who attempts to console her. I am confused as to which girl is which. The red headed one is talking about how she loves her new body and how graceful she is. Then she tells her sister that she is attractive and can find someone to be with if she wants to. Her sister responds by ashamedly showing her sister her blue scaled breasts. Her sister doesn't seem bothered and indicates this wouldn't prevent someone from liking her.

I don’t know why I’m there, I’m just there. My mom is there and I’m not entirely comfortable. She’s a younger version of herself - she’s in her forties, I think. I’m my age. I’m in a part of the room with a bed. I’m sitting on the bed and looking out the window. I can see this gigantic rat; it’s the size of a racoon. Or maybe it’s a koala. It’s like a cross between all three of those animals. It’s flying from some trees to a spot outside of the house where there is a hole big enough for it to get into. It gets in and crawls into a box across the room from me. I’m horrified and grossed out because this thing is really big and freaking me out with its long teeth. I’m not sure why it’s in the house. It’s like when you find a mouse in your house and it’s not your favorite thing in the world to see that you’re sharing space with the rodents. But this rodent thing is huge. I have this general sense of frustration. I’m mad that I’m there. I don't want to be spending time with my mom or be in the same space as her. She’s not in the room with me now though and not interacting. I’m just generally upset. Then she does come into the room. She’s pointing out to me some books that she’s read. I’m looking at the books on this dusty-ass bookshelf. The inside of the house is dark and reminds me of an old haunted house, like a Victorian era style with rugs and chandeliers. It’s darker inside and very dim lighting. These books are written by Loreena McKennitt. This is hilarious because Loreena McKennitt is actually a Canadian singer of Cetlic songs. But in my dream, she has written all these books and my mom is like, “Oh yeah, I remember reading all of these.” I’m looking at all of them and am like, “Did I read these?” I would be surprised if I didn’t read these because I read almost everything that was fantasy fiction fairy, (...)",

I look into the water and see another snake swimming in the water. As I watch, I realize it’s a huge anaconda and it’s undulating towards my mom, dad and sister. I yell at my parents and sister to warn them. I realize that I have to do something about this and find someone who can help me. Now I look at the ground again. The first two snakes are also anacondas - a lot larger than I first thought. There are also so many bathing snakes writhing around like earthworms, but they’re actually itty bitty baby snakes. I’m trying to cut them with a shovel. I can squash them with my shoes because I’m wearing flip flops and those won’t do. I’m looking for help and now realize that the snakes are a problem all over the island. I’m now at a hotel looking for more snakes and help. It’s late. I see Ted.

The drama is high. Everyone is in panic and fight or flight mode. I think I’m on a ship. We’re trying to figure out how to stop the aliens. Ryan Renolds is trying to come up with a plan. There are a ton of people and I don’t know any of them. They are the movie extras. I don’t think I see the aliens, I just see their ships through a spaceship window. The plan includes getting ahold of these two units that will blow something up - very typical movie bullshit. I’m on the ship. There are a couple ships in the fleet. All of the ships fly at superspeed. They’re flying through the planets in our solar system, so we’re whizzing by Mars and Venus, then you see Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune. I think the goal is to get to Jupiter or Saturn and blow up one of them. So, this is the scene. Then just like in the movies, the movie cuts away to Earth because we’re all trying to save Earth. The sky on Earth is a blood red - it looks like how the sky looked when all the smoke was around. I’m on the street suddenly and Ryan Renolds is with me. I don’t know if I’m actually interacting with him or not. It’s almost like I’m silently following him at first. I guess I’m the girlfriend character in the movie and he’s talking with me. We’re on the streets of Earth and I look up and see the sky is red. I keep seeing all these white parachutes falling - it’s the people who were on the spaceships. They’re coming home so they can say goodbye to their loved ones. They’re all ejecting out of space and coming down to Earth for one last goodbye to all the people they love. In the meantime, Ryan is still trying to figure out how to stop the aliens. They’re trying to find the hole in their plans or where their weak spot is.

I decide to attend one of them just to see how she teaches and to make the transition between her students and me as easy as possible for them. I’m surprised when I get there that the class is almost over because it was scheduled to start at 9:30am and it’s just a bit before 9:30 now. However, I walk in expecting the class to just be starting and it’s actually ending. She’s co-teaching with another person I’ve never seen. I think it’s significant that the person is brown and has an East Indian accent. The co-teacher is teaching yoga the way I’ve never seen it taught before in this area of Canada. It’s almost like a Jivamukti class where the teacher introduces a piece of philosophy and then teaches the class, only this is backwards where they’ve obviously already had their asana class and they’re sitting listening interestedly to the philosophy that the teacher is sharing. She describes tree pose as the opening of a door psychically. Her knee goes from flexion to extension and then she does the same thing with her hip, moving it from flexion to extension. She describes this as the movement of the psyche. Then she brings herself into ardha chandrasana and does the same thing with the lower arm, but it’s reaching out for a realm other than the one that we’re in. I think this is fascinating. So, I ask one of the people in the class who is an older lady with grey hair, she’s white, if the whole class was like this or if it’s just this period at the end. The woman turns around to answer me and I notice it’s a friend from my class in Grade 8. I’m surprised to see her. She says, “No, the whole class was like this.” I say, “Hmm, so this was your asana practice where you were mostly listening to stories and trying a few of the things she was saying?” She says, “Yes.” So I ask her, “Is this the same group of people, do all of you always attend this class?” She s (...)",

He thought we were suspicious and needed to take a full report. He asked if I'd given one before which I had when Jared wrecked his car. I figured he thought I'd been arrested before.

We are watching this younger guy in a movie who was my age and showing us that he was trying to finish high school when he was younger and something kept him from doing so. He took us to the school and I guess he maybe worked or volunteered at the school so they knew him. But something kept holding him back from going and then when we got there we went to the administrative office and got an excuse pass for being late that day. The next part of the dream was connected to the school. I was with a younger black girl who is trying to find a lunch and/or an after school sign up program. I am behind her as we are going around and all the groups are full, so we keep trying to find one. When we were about to give up someone said, “There’s one spot left!” We tried to put the name down but it was my older sister’s name and they started to cross it out and that’s when I woke up.",

There is an extremely obese woman who we are trying to help downstairs. She’s so obese, she can’t walk. She’s also unable to talk, though her eyes are open and she is conscious. We have two ropes with heavy duty paper clips at the ends. The ropes are wrapped around her body. We swing one rope to the ceiling and it hooks up on the ceiling. The other rope is tied to the banister of the stairs. It’s a team effort. Two or three of us are trying to maneuver her down the stairs. We keep throwing the top rope to the ceiling, but then it hooks to places where it looks like it will pull the ceiling down. It’s like the ceiling is covered with a taut fabric and I’m concerned that the fabric will tear under her weight. We have to unhook the rope then hook it again. We get her down one flight of stairs and think we’re done. But then we look down and see more stairs. We are just at a loft area with a bed. I find myself attracted to the man who is helping, too. The other two helpers are women. While the others are resting on the loft and rebuilding their strength, I go upstairs for snack. Our friend has returned from the market and is preparing dinner. She offers me and my son some snacks - a bag of fresh plums that have just been picked and a bag of cornichon pickles. My son reaches into the pickle bag. Inside the bag is a little green car the same size and color as the pickles. I let him have it. We eat. While we are eating, a woman with black coiffed hair comes in the front door.

We head towards a big farmhouse down the dirt road. There are fields of grass and fences along the side. We get to the house. It belongs to somebody I know, maybe my parents.

Anyway, they’re there and I’m glad to see them. I’m looking around for my clothes and I don’t know where they are, but I’m sure I was able to bring them. The bed is as wide as it is long. It must be a King size bed. I realize that that’s where I’m sleeping. As I’m looking through the dressers for my clothes, someone comes in and it’s Keith who I know from the studio. He’s sleeping on the other part of the bed. I feel really uncomfortable with this arrangement, but I’m glad I at least have somewhere to sleep. I move as far to the opposite edge of the bed as I can. When he enters the room he tells me, “Oh by the way, your clothes are in that dresser.” I think, “Okay good. I’ve got something to cook with and I’ve got some clothes.” I also have a wagon with a handle. I sleep but it’s a restless sleep. I’m too conscious of not rolling into him or something. The night passes. I see that the light at the windows is moving from dark to grey so I can get up now. As I’m getting out of bed, I accidentally lean my elbow on a part of his private parts and I feel really bad, but he doesn’t wake up. I get up anyway.

She’s happy to see me. I’m happy to see her. I’m a little bit surprised that she’s happy to see me, but it’s fun to be reunited. Then I go into the rest of the party. It’s interesting because I don’t really know the rest of the people there. I’m mingling and having a good time. Then my beloved Josh is there. I don’t know if I came with him or not. But he’s there and hitting on chicks, getting to know people as he does. I see him take one off to go fuck or do whatever they do. I say something to him like, “Hey, take the condom.” I watch them go off. Then I turn around and look for anyone I’d like to fuck. I think not really. Some of them are old high school classmates, but others I don’t know. Interesting thing is, this house is owned by my friend’s ex. He owns the house and he’s the host. He has all this money and the house is really big with tall windows. The living room is really open and the windows slide open like patio doors, but they’re taller than patio doors.

Then just as quickly as the crowd multiplied exponentially, so do the punches. Then some of them start running. They’re running down the hallway.

We were walking on a path to California, then we heard something coming and we went into the bushes to hide. There is a fence behind us. On the California side is a restaurant that we were heading to. The dogs are coming. We’ve heard about these dogs and how they can be vicious. We take out a bottle of lotion from our bag and put lotion in our hands, then get some sticks to protect us just in case. We are hoping the dogs will just walk on by. At first, the dogs are just puppies. Every dog that walks by is a little bit older. As the dogs get older, they get more wild and ragged looking, also heavier and denser with more wrinkles in their skin. The dogs keep getting bigger and bigger. They keep walking by, not pausing to notice us. We think we’ll be okay. Then, one of the biggest and oldest dogs stops right in front of our hiding spot. He turns and stares towards us. He stays there for a long time. After a long while, I start to get antsy. I point up to the fence and ask my husband if I can climb up to the top and then he can go and take care of the dog. He says, “Sure.” I climb up and am surprised I can so easily get up there. My husband advances on the dog. He doesn’t have to smear the lotion in the dog’s eyes or poke it with the stick. The dog just decides to move on. Now all the dogs have moved on. We go across the border, too. We see my friend Maxine and her boyfriend. they’re at the bar ordering a lot of drinks. They’ve traveled a long way to get here and celebrate. I’m a little concerned because she is drinking a lot and they have to drive all the way back once the restaurant closes. I’m thinking that maybe he’ll drive because he isn’t drinking as much as she is. Then the dream shifts and I’m on the side of a path with my son. We are looking out over the river.

A black girl of about my age knocked on the door and introduced herself. We started talking and I became interested in her. She stayed with me most days and we cooked meals together. We were cooking our second meal, a salad or stew, and I had her grate the carrots while I cut up cabbages. She mostly finished the carrots but was left with a large piece of moist and mushy carrot the size of a grapefruit. I thought she might have been able to grate more but I didn't press it.  .....  The room had turned into a hostel and many other guests were trickling in and taking their seat on bunk beds. It was all couples and families. I woke up early around 5am but all of the clocks in the room were showing different times. We got ready and eventually went to get breakfast.   I made a mistake getting in line but corrected it. I got to the table where there was food but only found ice cream, cookies, and cinnamon rolls. I took an ice cream cone and one of each of the rest. I worried that all the sugar would make me have to find a restroom once we started driving.",

There’s water on the floor, about an inch of it, and it feels damp and cold. I’m inside with three people. We’re taking turns sleeping in shifts. We can only sleep for a maximum of eight minutes. We’re practicing a rotation that we can take this copper wire thing and roll it up into a key. It’s kind of shaped like a paperclip. We have to take it out of its shape and roll it into two other things within a certain amount of time. One of the shapes, you take one end and it ends up looking something like a flower. And the other, I’ve already forgotten what it looks like. We’re really, really tired. Everybody wants to sleep more than we are, but we can’t because we’re training ourselves to escape this place. We’ve got this old lumpy mattress on the floor so it keeps you off the water. There’s one set of sheets. The person who’s sleeping gets to stretch out and the rest of us are just sitting on something like one of those trundle buggies or wheely carts where you put things in them for shopping and they have a handle. Homeless people use them or the elderly. So we’re sitting on that to keep us up out of the water. So you not only have to be able to snap out of your sleep quickly, you also have to be dropped into your sleep quickly. If we can do all of this within eight minutes - fall asleep, wake up, fold the wire into the two different shapes - then we’re sure we can manage our escape. Everybody has to go through the rotation and there are four of us all together. So we do this. It repeats in the dream four times. One person has a really hard time waking up and it’s making all of us anxious. We’re shaking her and saying, “You’ve gotta get up! You’ve gotta get up!” She finally wakes up. We make her go through that a couple more times so she is waking up at the proper time. When she does, we take the sheets of the bed, but we have to leave the top (...)",

They’re walking toward people one table over from us and I can’t see who it is. My friend says that it’s Candace. I ask one of the people that are walking by, “What’s going on over there with the fitness gear?” She says, “Oh, Candace is starting to run her own fitness facility and people are applying for the job.” I think I could do that. But I don’t have any paper with me or a resumé. I’m looking around on the table for something I can use as a piece of paper. I’m asking my friend if she has a paper or a pen. I’m trying to write my experience down. I’m seeing people over there who have absolutely no experience at all, but they’re saying they do and they’re just dressing the part. I wonder why she hasn’t asked me because we’re friends on Facebook and she knows I teach these classes. I wonder if I should even bother applying. My friend convinces me that I should and finds a piece of paper. I begin to write and the pen has a really fat nib and my writing looks terrible; the ink is blotchy. I only get three sentences written when we’re asked to leave the table. I’m trying to write the rest of this out but i can’t find a flat surface. The pen looks like a marker with the tip squished down so it’s fat and there’s hardly any ink in it. It just looks awful. I do, however, finish writing it out. I put it in a piece of paper and go to give her the envelope. She acts like she doesn’t know me. However, I leave it on the table and I walk away.",

I was standing on the wooden porch overlooking the water when a neighbor's boat came by. I rushed down the stairs to the water to stop it. I used a boat hook and snagged it but the current was so strong that I was pulled out and around the house almost ending up in the water. No one was helping me and I was sliding off of a dock toward the water. By a miracle I managed to stay on dry land and successfully saved the boat. In the process of doing this I had to take some small white pieces out of the boat. Whether that or the pieces were damaged in my attempt to save the boat. Grandma O. said that the owners would be angry with me but I was sure this was unreasonable.  The storm continued and my dad was on the computer looking at a radar map for the country. I wanted to get on to see of there was a tornado coming. He wouldn't let me check the details but I could see that there was a tornado directly over our county.  Our mom was outside staring in the direction of the storm having spotted the tornado.

So when the boat swings around, I see him and my heart is relieved to see him floating and riding the wave with his head turned to the side. It looks like he’s having a good time. I lean over and pull him up by the life vest back onto the boat. The boat pulls over to a grassy bank. We get out. There are picnic tables and a few families are camping and getting a meal ready. My son just invites himself to join, immediately finding the kids and playing with them. I’m looking around and notice it’s children and elderly people, no one in between. Somehow, I have the birth records of all the people. I’m looking through the papers and see that there’s an 11 year old girl, a 9 year old boy, a 91 year old man and a 90 year old woman.

I have a table with my laptop on it and other things that I think I’m going to need to teach online. My baby won’t sleep very well. She’s very sensitive to not being held. So she relaxes and closes her eyes after she nurses, but as soon as I set her down, no matter how slowly I do it, she wakes up once she’s in her crib. She doesn’t cry very much. She’s very quiet. She’s just sensitive. I’ve tried wrapping her up so she feels like she’s still bundled. That maybe lasts for another sixty seconds once she gets in her crib, but she still wakes up. I end up carrying her around on my left hip quite a bit. Other than the fact that I’m worried she’s not sleeping enough, this is okay because she is quiet when I’m teaching.

We only had two ships left but they were hidden in a tunnel and though poorly manned, one of the was a black vessel which held some secret power.  As the enemy ship approached it did not slow amd I realized that there intention was to ram the gates destroying them and their ship in the process. I began to panic and with no one to take charge I began issuing commands.   I readied the troops then rushed into the tunnels leading out of the castle to make sure all of the women and children escaped. William was there and blocked my path. He was making sure I wasn't escaping. I wasn't and was taking the path leading to the gates so that I could form some plan to stop the enemy ship.",

She had this huge kitchen with all of these desserts lined up and organized for a party she was having for her kids. I tried to help pass out birdhouses but they were all wrong hanging from broken hooks. My younger sister Sarah was there and I was going to give her a cabbage patch one because she wouldn’t have had that in her age group growing up younger, but I got chastised for it. Not sure by who. It was dark. So many desserts. I went to get something out of my bag and my cash was soaking wet because something spilled on it and Aidan said I could pay her for my kids and I was like, “my kids?” I guess she had been watching my kids in the dream all weekend while I did this other thing. I also paid the police people.",

I would hide from place to place and there was a road that I kept traveling and the more I traveled it, the more familiar it became and shorter it became to get to this place. I called someone on the phone and asked them about directions but didn’t want to give away that I knew the modern name for the road because I knew they didn’t know it yet because they were from the past. I knew it as Road 1 and referred to it as Road 9 but even that didn’t make sense to them. The road had FOG so much fog on it. When I arrived I stayed somewhere creepy with these dolls everywhere but I realized they were broken tiny babies and deformed and in pain. There was one person watching them. There were houses and houses of them all tiny to larger and more deformed and grotesque and they were missing limbs and in pain. The bigger ones looked like paper mache. I was hiding and searching and calling around for my daughter. I found out that my ex Rory had been to visit her six times and I didn’t even know she existed. She was mine but also Asian. When I found the house where she was I was so relieved because the caretaker explained to me a little about it, she asked me, “Are you coming to say goodbye?” and I said, “I think so.” She was Asian and handed me black silk pants and a purse to hand to my daughter and said, “She looks just like you with the hair and eyes,” and I was confused but relieved and crying and sad to do this. I had never done this before and now that I was going to say goodbye, I had so many questions. I was glad the place was nice and not decrepit like all of the other places I had been searching. Some of the places had been abandoned and just full of dead babies. I was just about to meet her when my dog moved and I woke up. I tried to go back to sleep but couldn’t so wrote all of this down.",

We joked that I should find a pair of each and wear them but we worried that if too many people did this the theme would be ruined. I searched for s pair of pants that would fit but the smallest size was a 46. I did find a shirt which was a large but as I wanted a matching set I didn't bother with either.

She is high up again. She comes down and is still feeling the ring of fire. We’re all with her supporting her. I can see the spreading to release the baby. There is no hair or blood, just smooth and clean. She’s placing her hands on the ground as if preparing to do a handstand. Erin is with her. In a moment with a little push, the baby shoots out of her, a little grey slimy sweet baby. The baby flies across the room. Another woman across the room is the first to catch and hold the baby.

I look with friends, if you lifted this big wooden hatch, underneath it was a concrete-lined chamber in which the water would go up a foot or two and the down a foot or two over a minute or so. This was somehow caused by the creature breathing. The aliens, or whatever they were, were represented by one guy, who looked human.

I think, “Hmm, are there not any articles where someone has behaved ethically?” I don’t really find any. Then I decide I’m not worried about it because I’ll just ask the students to read the article, say if they are in favor or not in favor of the way the author has presented it, and either way please back your reasoning up. I email the students the articles ahead of time so they can read them first. Then I go have a shower. I’m procrastinating. I only have an hour to get dressed, shower and get there. It takes me twenty minutes to get there. While I'm in the shower, I take the shower head off and I use it to pleasure myself. I wake up for a moment because I’ve stimulated myself to orgasm. I wait until the orgasm completes and then I finish my shower, only I realize that I don’t actually have time to wash my hair. So I rinse off the bit of shampoo and conditioner I put on to save time and get dressed. I make it all the way down to where I’m supposed to teach. I'm still a little bit early.

There was another verse from a different book that I tried to remember, imagining that I was a coach answering the question in a coaches quiz. I couldn't remember the exact wording.  I decided to write up all of the questions used in the last event in an Excel spreadsheet along with some summary info on the quizzes. I was working on it while at a party with some other quizzers. There was alcohol and I had two drinks followed by trying some vodka and soda mixture.  As I worked on my computer to get the questions finished, an attractive girl to my right with dark hair was having trouble logging into her Word account to access a document. I offered to help but she wasn't interested. I asked her if she wanted me to send her my document when I was finished.

    "text": "“The Spectre” I’m in the house on A. Street. There’s some kind of renovation going on. There are also a lot of people. I don’t understand what they’re there for. I’m circulating through the various floors and chatting with people. It’s like someone invited me to an open house and I don’t know any of the people there so I’m just casually circulating around, except that I’m completely familiar with the house. So I don’t feel as awkward as I would normally in a place where I know zero people. I’m an outsider to the conversations. So I go upstairs then I go back downstairs. I sit on the porch for a little while. I’m an outsider to that conversation. Then I go into the main floor where the living room and kitchen are, and the same thing, I’m an outsider. Then I come back outside and I sit on the front steps. I turn around because something in the conversation peaks my interest. I look at them and I see this spectre. It’s black and has not necessarily a malevolent presence, but ominous. It’s leaning against the bricks. Other peoples’ eyes are facing it, but they’re continuing on with their conversations as though it’s not there. So I think they can’t see it. It makes me feel concerned because it’s like the usher that walks you down the aisle and it feels like death is the play that’s about to start. I wonder who is it there for? Then, on the lawn, there are a lot of children starting to gather. They're just playing a game with a stick - throwing the stick and catching it. There’s a ball that they’re kicking through a hoop. Now I wander through the house again. This time instead of just meandering, I’m looking to see if there’s any imminent danger or someone that’s unwell and might need some help. I go through the floors looking for that. When I get back down to the main floor I realize I need to use the washroom. I wander over that way. There’s somebody in it, so I stand outside and wait. When he comes out, he’s quite a chatty fellow. He starts trying to engage me in conv (...)",

I have this fancy apartment with big windows that go floor to ceiling and hardwood floors, definitely a very modern minimalist feel to it. There’s a fireplace. There’s an upstairs. The kitchen is big with pendant lights and a bar area. I have all these kids. I’m teaching them something but I can't remember what it is. We’re talking about all kinds of things. Their parents have all dropped them off and they’re here at the party for a reason, but there’s also some other agenda. I realize at a certain point that they really don’t need me to be the adult in the room telling them what to do and what’s up. They’ve got it. They understand all the things. At one point we end up in a conference room, not in the apartment. There’s a long table down the middle of the conference room. I can't remember what’s being discussed, but it seems like there’s problem solving happening. We spend some time in that conference room. When we come out of it is when I realize these kiddos don’t need me to tell them what to do; they understand what’s happening. We finish up and come back to the apartment and everyone is tired because we’ve been doing major strategizing. Everyone wants to rest, relax and hang out. I’m like, “Yes, of course. Let’s do that. We’ll hang out while we wait for your parents to come get you.” It must be cold outside because there’s a pile of snow boots and jackets all over the place. What’s funny is they didn’t prepare for this. When they were dropped off, they were in shorts and t-shirts, but after the conference it’s freezing. So there’s all kinds of boots everywhere that we scavenged from somewhere - I don’t know if I had them in my closet or what. They got wet. One of the kids says they’ll put them near the fire. I say, “Well, there’s a big outdoor fire pit in this complex and I’ll just go put them in the fire.” But the shoes don’t burn, they dry. Then all the swea (...)",

Something about his tall, stocky build or large poorly shaved face clued me in.  I told him that no one seemed to have magic mushrooms and asked him if he knew where any might me. He told me that the fact that no one offered or knew about magic mushrooms meant that they had them in very high quality and wanted to keep the secret from outsiders.",

As he walked, he would greet people and his microphone would pick up on the noise. He kept forgetting the lyrics to the song, and making things up as he went along. He stopped to apologize saying that he had forgotten the lyrics. He was very jovial and not at all bothered by this. One line in the song was \"Tomatoes and potatoes\" but it was wrong and he changed potatoes to something else.  I had been watching this on YouTube, but found myself in Germany following Morten Harket. He was entering a building and I stopped to look at the sign in front of it. It was a blue sign with three circles representing the Trinity. It was a Christian organization. The sign also said something about the Rhine. I waited and then entered the building purposefully. It was a fancy restaurant and everyone was speaking German. I walked around as if I knew what I was looking for so that no one would notice that I was out of place. I couldn't find Morten Harket or his band members and figured that they were upstairs.",

It’s pitch black out, the night sky has no moon and no stars. It’s not unpleasant - it’s not rainy or snowy - it’s just dark. We walk for quite some time. We are supposedly going to Keith’s house, it’s a cottage or something. We get there and his mom is home. We are supposed to just be stopping to say hi to her, change our clothes, and then put the boat in the water. I’ve already walked around the backyard to see where the boat is. I’m looking at the water. Everybody seems to be taking a long time, so I go back into the house. They’re involved in quite a conversation with his mom. I’m waiting for them to finish talking and I sit down. Then Omar walks into the room and he sits down. It’s like they’re all talking but they’re not talking about anything, they’re just waiting. Eventually I sit down, too. I wonder why they’re sitting and waiting. I wonder what they're waiting for. I decide I might as well have a nap. There’s a pullout couch and it’s already been pulled out. I lie down on it. His mom comes over and sits beside me but she doesn’t say anything. She’s still in this kind of limbo. I’m not actually tired, I’m just lying down. Then the other guys get up as though they’re going to put their outdoor clothing on. I think we’re going, so I sit up on the corner on the pullout couch.

I'm complaining of depression and anxiety, forget the words I used. I don't use the term spiritual malaise, but that is in fact what I was talking about. I'm taken to an upstairs rom, like a meditation room, where the spirit of a deceased friend of mine, and to the guys in the house, a woman, manifests. Don't know if I ever actually see her, but there's this altar and a blue light comes. She talks to me, but I don't remember what she said, and I don't remember who it was. Some spiritually advanced female friend. Various incidents in this house. The seance, if that's what is was, was over fairly quickly, and then I'm just sitting in the room after she's gone, just thinking about things. Toward the end of my being there, I'm talking to a young man, black hair. I sort of know him. He gives me aa partially rolled joint, and I try to finish the job by licking the adhesive. He's already licked it a little. The joint is quite fat, and the glue has been too saturated and doesn't seal properly. At first I think he wants me to smoke it there with him, but then I don't want to smoke it there. I want to smoke it later, by myself at home. I ask him if he has a little baggie or something I could put it in, as I'm afraid it will fall apart in my pocket, and he doesn't. I'm afraid I'm imposing. We're in a garage area. There are various papers. I'm looking for something to wrap this in, some newsprint of some scrap paper. I can't find anything.

There's an enclosure, a breakwater, but also a big wooden shed on pilings over the beach and water, that's open toward the water, but you're basically swimming inside. Hundreds of people there. When not inside the shed, I can see fairly substantial waves out in the open water. Doesn't quite amount to surf, but fairly large waves. An ingenious construction separate from the breakwater, that dissipates the wave's energy before it gets to the enclosure.

    "text": "I'm living in a third world country in a dilapidated village made of sheet metal houses close together and stacked up several stories high. My tribe is angry with me for retaliating against our enemy tribe for something they did to wrong us. They wronged us and I responded out of proportion by killing 1, 3, or 10 of their 33 tribesmen. I had just smoked some marijuana and was running from the members of my tribe along a dirt path. I stopped by a house and reached inside through a hole in the low roof and fished a pipe out which smoked for a few seconds before continuing. Until this point it was in 3rd person and I thought it was funny that I had stopped for the smoke.  I was caught in an open dirt area and I collapsed. The first man to get to me, who was brown and shirtless, punched me in the face though I was already down. He had to attack me since I deserved it. The rest showed up and I see an old man lying on the ground. He says that I should be thankful that my tribesmen are not going to rape me which is what sometimes happens.  They confront me and are angry explaining that our snuff stores are at 1/3 capacity and that we can only trade with our enemy tribe for it. I suggest that we trade them our prized possession, a TV which gets a single black and white crime show with episodes running every 16 minutes.  The man in charge eventually agrees and we go in to look at the TV. For a moment I am pulled into the show as two detectives look for a body. I can see an abandoned black and white duffel bag in a corner which they need to find.  Back at my place, I am my normal western self and not an African tribesman. We wonder if it will be best if I deliver the TV.  Back in the show I am working with several other cops, one with long blonde hair. I am investigating the upstairs of a concrete building and they are below. Together we jump into the floor or ceiling and destroy it such that I fall down with the rest of them.",

We need to move things around in the house and clean up and reorganize because we’ve hired a group of people to professionally clean and paint the trucks to get them ready. They’re going to pull the truck in through the garage and into the living room. We’re moving things around, reorganizing the little tables. Then I go outside and the cleaning people come in their van. A woman gets out and she is in a black and tan bikini. She’s wet, cold and miserable. We’re trying to figure out how to move the work into the sun so she isn’t in the cold shade. Then I get them set up and go to the garage. There’s a big shiny black fancy RV driven by ninjas. A ninja is swinging from a trapeze bar in the trees. It’s an advertisement to invite people to a tea tasting. I want to try. I jump on the trapeze bar and am swinging. It’s quite frightening. At first I’m just swinging back and forth and then I start doing more - when I swing forward I pike my body and touch my toes to the bar and do that a few times, making sure I don’t lose my grip. Then I work on the next stage of swinging my legs back and pushing myself up on the bar with my hands. I don’t quite get it. Then the dream dissolves and I’m now in an RV with Rose and a girl I knew from church in middle school. We are driving to a professor’s house at Stanford.

I can’t remember all of it, but there was the word, “isa” or “esa” with three numbers above and three numbers below. I can’t throw this one away; I have to keep it. In fact, I’ve been meaning to tear out just that one piece of paper because it’s proof. What it’s proof of, I’m not sure. But in the dream, my biological mother has been telling lies about me. It’s abusive. None of it is true. I’ve done a lot of self-healing and self-parenting around that and accepted that she will always tell those kinds of lies and there will be some who believe her, but I’ve moved on and am living my own life.

I figure whoever lives there makes his money in that area. There's a cat, a very large orange tabby. It's sleeping. I only see its head. It's under or behind a couch cushion. It's a very sweet kitty. I pet its head but it doesn't wake up. More cats, in the same house. One kitty has feline HIV. She shouldn't have sex. She's not in heat, though. There's a very horny boy kitty. He's 97 % black, tuxedo cat, and he's chasing the girl kitty around. There's someone there who is up to date on all these cats. He said there was some physical reason why the kitty with HIV shouldn't have sex, but he wasn't doing anything to stop it. Or maybe she wasn't able to. Forget what the deal was. Before that, Mom, in a different house. Think this preceded the dream with Morley, above. There are several dozen, quite old, very interesting books. Several had come from the same source. I go through them, looking at them and sorting them out again. Morley has a bunch of photos, I think of cats. Whom am I with? Female. We're looking at Morley's photos,which he has on display boards, under plastic. There's one in particular we find very amusing and sweet, and we want a copy of it. We tell Morley this. He only has one copy of each. It's like pre-digital days, chemical photography. I say if not now, I'd love to have a print whenever you can have a duplicate made. I'll pay for it. He seemed open to the idea, but don't recall that he said anything.",

    "text": "Food is being served on long tables set against each other end to end. There are big circular plates of a frittata like food with some light purple-pink sauce poured on top. There is an order for who is to get the food first, but there are mothers of young children who are pushing to the front and making a mess of things with their plates. They are shouldering in front of each other and getting more food than they are allotted or is appropriate for the number of people who are here. The food gets to be more and more of a mess and spreading on the table and falling to the ground. A woman is next to me with three plates. She is justifying her actions saying, “This is for my son and this is for my daughter and this is for my husband.” She keeps putting more and more pieces on her plate while people are hungrily pushing forward against us. I have my plate and at first just cut one piece, but then I get just a little more, then just a little more, beginning to feel the scarcity of hunger and not knowing if there will be enough. Then I’m upstairs in the same building and alone. It’s an old stone building without windows, but rather openings carved into the thick stone walls. There are two young boys who have been brainwashed in some way. They are putting stones in the openings to cover the light. As they do this, they are turning the building into marsh. I can see green vines growing from wherever they touch. I’m panicking then trying to control my breath and clear my mind so I can make a plan to save this all from collapsing and turning into marsh.",

I’m wandering through the house looking for somebody I know. I don't see anybody when I go through the first three rooms. When I get to the backroom, I see my friend Kenny. He’s sitting with one of his sisters and both of his parents. I’m comfortable with them so I stay there. I don’t mingle. I just have conversations in turn with each of them until the event starts to wind down and the crowd starts to thin. Kenny leaves. I’m still taking to his sister; we’re having a bonding conversation about being the mother of boys. It’s time for her to go home and it’s just the parents left. They ask me if I would like a ride and I accept. I get into the car. I don’t know what happens to the mom, maybe we dropped her off earlier. I’m in the car now with the dad. He says to me, “Is it okay if we stop somewhere because I need to pick something up?” He tells me where it is and I say, “Yes, that’s fine. It’s only five minutes from my house.” We pull up and it’s a really tall apartment building. There’s a circular approach to it and he pulls up the car to the front of the main door. Then he says, “Oh, I didn’t realize you can’t park here. If I stay in the car while it’s running, do you mind going up and getting the parcel?” I say, “No, that’s fine.” He describes to me the floor that it’s on and tells me that I have to go down to the end of the hallway and it’s the last door on the right. He says it should be open. I follow the instructions and end up where he tells me. The door is open. I go into the hallway and see a parcel there and it’s bright orange, the kind of orange you’d see on a construction site. I pick up the parcel and exit the door backwards. I leave my left arm in the doorway, so it doesn’t make a loud noise as it closes. I’m starting to feel strange about being in somebody’s apartment when I don't know them and picking something (...)",

There are a ton of people coming and going; some of them are my siblings, some are my siblings’ classmates, and I think some are my classmates, too. They’re all on a mission of some sort. I don’t know what they’re doing, but they’re coming home from some event they were at or some project they were doing. There are a lot of people, at least twenty, in the living room and more people outside. At one point I see a huge outrigger canoe being rolled through the yard and into the living room, which magically expands to fit it. I’m lying on a couch and pretty tired. I’m exhausted and just watching them come and go. People are stopping to talk with me but I’m not really involved in whatever is happening or whatever mission they seem to be on. At one point I sit up and look out to the driveway and the hedge that separates our house from the neighbor house. Behind the hedge is a gigantic tree with a treehouse in it. It looks like an oak tree in the way the trunk and branches are growing but I don’t know if it’s an oak because this is Hawaii. I’m watching people climb up and down the tree - it’s a treehouse but also an obstacle course with places where you can work out. It’s all somehow in this tree. I’m watching other people working out. Then I see a real tiger, orange and black, climb the tree and do the workout. I’m like, “Whoa, I didn’t know tigers could move like that.” I’m watching the tiger the whole time because I’m fascinated by what it’s doing and how it can do it, and also that it seems to be listening to the people. It’s as if it’s taking instructions from the humans - maybe not verbally, but from watching and then doing what they’re doing. Then the tiger climbs out of the tree and I think it’s going into the house through the backdoor. It’s at the backdoor and doing pullups on this pullup bar in the door. I see my brother (the one with the sustained traumatic brain injury in real life, but in the dream he’s normal and  (...)",

I don't want to answer because it's politically incorrect so tell her I was reading about a strange way of handling RMAs.  Jared and Daniel join me and are being loud not realizing it is a hospital. We speak for a bit but I forget the words. We leave together and find ourselves in a classroom with students and a few adults. People are already speaking. We walk up to the front and Jared and Daniel find a seat by themselves. There is no room for me, so I go sit in the row where Sam Riegal is sitting. Earlier I made a joke about all of us sitting up front in a corner where we would speak quietly among ourselves and send the occasional text to Sam. Everyone laughed.   There were two women to the left of Sam and I squeezed past them. The younger one made a disdainful gesture meaning \"of course you would sit here.\" She thought I was interested in her. I sat down and found that the person in front of me had a giant fluffy golden retriever which took up multiple rows. I rested my head against it and drifted off into a semi conscious state.

Before he leaves, I question him about his motives and ask what he will do if he quickly realizes that he can't find paradise. I tell him that if paradise could be found on the roads in a minivan surely someone else would already have found it. He doesn't have an answer but it is clear that he needs to do this.

We’re strategizing and learning how to get through. We’re on an elevated platform where we can see the tigers. As we go up, I see one of the tigers, a white one, lounging by the megalithic stones. These stones were carved by human hands a long time ago. The tigers were brought in as guardians. There are at least three. We are on the platform learning a dance sequence involving people going in small groups of six or eight at a time, then they pair off. It’s a simple sequence, just holding hands and lifting a leg up, then turning, then lifting the other leg and turning. But you have to do it with precision and the right amount of tension. This is the way to get past the tigers without being attacked. I don’t have anyone to pair off with, so I’m going through the motions by myself. I’m also wary of holding people’s hands. I wander out into a group getting ready to practice. There is a woman with no strength or tension in her arms and I don't want to work with her. There are two men who are interested in practicing the sequence with me. One is tall with pale skin and light red hair. I don’t recall what the other looked like. The red haired man begins to practice with me. Everyone thinks I’ll do this well and so do I. But I fail and I don’t get another chance to practice until everyone else has gone through again. I’m watching and practicing from the sides. The practice session is over. People come and lay out food and drink on high bar tables. I’m squished between people at the end, but not fully at the table, sort of behind their shoulders. A few of them are talking about their language lessons and their weekly or monthly dinner parties.

But it’s still a place where people tie up their boats and get out and into their cars. It kind of looks like a marina in Wilson, New York. My friend has her boat there and she’s sitting at a picnic table with a few other people. There is a riding lawn mower and I get on it because I’ve never sat on one before. She says, “Why don’t you start it up?” I say, “Is it okay?” She says, “Yeah, just start it up the way you would a car.” I see a key in the ignition and I start it. The engine turns over, it’s on, and we’re moving forward. At first i’m just driving it on the grass, just getting used to it. It looks like the grass has been freshly cut, so I’m not making any marks on the grass with it. Then, there’s something in the middle of the grass on a slope - a garden. I see that the grass is taller around the garden and now the lawn mower is leaving marks. So I think it would be irresponsible of me just to have driven this around haphazardly and to ruin the look of it. So I start going up and down the grassed area in an organized way. I’m trying to get close to the garden without cutting the flowers. My friend has now gotten out and gone back to her boat for something. We finished eating at the picnic tables and she’s tidying that stuff up. I realize I need to put the lawn mower back where I found it. There are a couple of spots that look really, really bad now because I didn’t quite finish going up and down properly. So I’m trying to cut across with those spots close to the garden and there’s another one a bit further away. I think I do this...I don’t remember turning the lawn mower off or parking it somewhere. The next thing I remember is I’m in a car. It’s pulling up outside an apartment building and I’ve been sleeping in it. I’m really, really, really tired. I’m in the backseat. Luke is driving. The car stops in front of the apartment building. A few mo (...)",

The chosen captain doesn’t survive the journey. I’m watching to see how this happens, wondering if the captain is murdered or dies of natural causes or has an accident of some kind. The crew is assembled. The boat is beautiful but totally empty. We all get on the boat. As the people move up and down the different levels of the boat, I'm peering through windows. There are people carrying small lanterns to light their way, others writing in journals, others sleeping, others watching the stars. I’m waiting to see where the captain is going and what will happen to the captain. Maybe by watching, it may shift the way things develop. Maybe the captain will survive. But there is no way to know. Then, a bathtub with a little girl in the tub, prepubescent, learning about puberty. Hanna is in one room. Rose is in another room. Another woman is also present. Hanna is very light in her questioning. Rose is very certain in her teaching, talking about the first blood and how to measure a ship to be as clear as possible from the beginning. Do we measure from end to end, or only the livable portion of a ship? She’s talking about how to maintain and care for the pubic hair without having razor bumps. Rose says, “Well, of course you massage first for a while.” She says this as if everyone should know. I feel ashamed that I do not know and remind myself to remember when I wake up.",

[There is a real route 184, but it is a short route in Auburn.] I'm wandering around a certain area in downtown Centerville, near Westlake Square. Before I get on the 184 I talk to the bus driver. Then I get on, and it goes up Olive way, not as in reality, but recognizable, and it gets on the freeway and immediately gets off at the very next exit, which is less than a quarter mile away. It's a big, long, bus, but it goes down lanes that aren't really streets, just one lane, 90 degree turns on the outside of buildings, climbing this steep hill. At one point I'm outside the bus. Before too much longer it goes back downtown, so I get off because it isn't going where I want it to. Then it occurs to me to look for a bus stop with that route number on it. I never do find it. There's a bus number that's close, but not exactly right. As I wander around, there are a number of incidents. I walk through a snowy plaza at least twice, but there isn't any snow anywhere else. The last time I walk through the snow is melting, and it's very sloppy. Paths have been cleared, but where they haven't been, it's slush city. I go into a rather posh hotel lobby, and sit down. In the lobby they're offering coffee, tea, juice, so I have some. I sit in a couple different places and feel awkward and conspicuous, not that anyone is paying any attention to me. When I leave I've got, I've been schlepping all kinds of different stuff around with me, but when I leave I'm carrying several dishes and saucers from the hotel. I just walk out with them. Somehow in my head I think, well, if they're giving away coffee and tea and juice, then they're giving away dishes, too. But later I think, wait, that doesn't really make sense. (!) At another point I pass small public freezers, just on the sidewalk. There's one I look at. I had something I wanted to put in (...)",

Once inside of the preserve, I found that it was a great open grassy area where the ground was especially springy as if I were walking on sponges. Everything was green and I had to climb up a springy mountainside. Looking to my left I could see that I was at the edge of a cliff and was extremely high. The whole preserve was floating a mile or so above the ground as if the entire city were floating in midair. My dad was nearby.",

They handed the baby to me and said, “Feed it.” I looked at them confused because it wasn’t my baby and I had no milk to feed it. Whoever handed it to me, the baby’s mother, did something to me so my breasts were lactating. I remember my breasts hurting. I could feel the feeling of let-down but also the soreness of when you’ve just started breastfeeding or your baby has nursed a little too hard and your nipples are sensitive. I could feel that and the pressure of being engorged. I couldn’t feed the baby fast enough. I kept trying. The baby had a plastic face shield that everyone is wearing these days and it couldn’t get to the milk. I tried to lift the face shield up so it could latch on, but the baby just couldn’t get latched on in the right way. I remember feeling frustrated but also scared for the baby because I couldn’t feed it and wasn’t able to give it what it needed.

I’m moving into it with two girlfriends that I currently work with at the yoga studio. It’s move-in day but we don’t have any furniture, so we’re doing a walk-through. We look through the main floor. It looks clean. The upstairs has three bedrooms, one for everyone. The bathroom looks like it’s in good shape. They stay up on the top floor. They’re looking around in the bedrooms for some specific measurements or something. I go down into the basement. Although the basement looks clean and dry, there’s something creepy in it; it’s an energy that I feel. I walk over to the sliding patio glass doors. I look behind the blinds. I see an old man there. He’s gardening. I ask him if he needs anything. He says, “No, I’m good thanks.” He’s in the backyard on the other side of the glass and I’m on the inside. I look down to see what he’s doing. He has a toolbox and he’s fixing something. I ask him if he’s going to need to come into the house. He replies in a voice like, “Oh no no, I would never go in there.” I think he knows something about this creepy energy in the basement. Then I go back upstairs to the main floor. The other two girls are starting to bring in boxes and furniture. I’m helping with that, bringing in my own stuff. We each set up our bedrooms then go downstairs. They’re having trouble arranging the furniture in the living room. A couple pieces are mine, a couple pieces belong to each one of them and we’re just trying to group them together. I look at what they have and say, “Hmm, it’s funny that this won’t fit because when I used to live here, I had the same pieces of furniture and they all fit just fine.” So we keep rearranging and put the couch on another wall and arranging the other stuff around it. We try this on three different walls when I say, “Wait a minute, I know why this isn’t fitting! That one wall that goes from the main ha (...)",

We were about to head out together. I was speaking with a person about the way training worked and how it took up to 5 hours every other weekend. Then I remembered that it was actually a full weekend and the other person thought that was too much.  I left in a church van with P. M. and the other quizzers making some joke where I addressed P. M. by his first name as an equal. I wasn't quite sure if I should have called him by his first name. Once in the van I realized that we were heading to P.M.'s church and that my parents had no idea where I was going. I I couldn't get a hold of them.

But there’s no staff. I have to do the cooking, serving and cleaning up all at once. The people who are eating know this is an experiment. There are three tables of people. They’re all putting in their orders and are very expectant. It’s just me. And there’s one other person who’s watching me and helping me a little, waiting for my direction, but more observing. I’m panicked because there’s too much to do. There’s no way to cook and serve and clear the tables and get everyone’s order and fill the water glasses all at the same time. It’s just too much. I’m trying as hard as I can. Everything is white in this restaurant - white table cloths, white walls, white floor - and part of it seems outdoors, there is no ceiling. After the meal is entirely served and I’m all done, the tables have nothing but complaints about the service, the food and how terrible everything was. I look at them and am like, “You all volunteered for this and you knew that it was just me and I said it was not going to do all the things. But you guys all wanted this and you did it anyway. And now you’re critiquing me for it when I told you it wasn’t possible for me to do everything and I would need help.” I was panicked and frustrated.",

Nothing was given as to what city. It was on a desolate street on the edge of an uninspired downtown, on the wrong side of everything. I'm staying in this room. It's a corner room. One of the windows has been painted over with the same paint that's on the walls. Some texturing, some bits in the paint. I wonder to myself why they had done that. But there were little gaps in the paint on that window, where the paint had shrunk away from the edges and you could just barely see the street. A small lobby. but never saw a desk. And a little restaurant or canteen that operated in one side of the lobby, which was very small. The restaurant was open only a few hours in the morning and again in the afternoon. At one point some other people in the room with me. I realize I'm hungry. I want to make something to eat. I had some food with me. Finally the other people leave. I look through the gap in the paint on the window. There's a young man coming down the street quite rapidly. He's on some high-tech roller skates. I leave the building then come back. I hadn't locked the door, but everything's ok. Feelings of desolation went with this. But I accepted everything. [see November 3, 2020]",

We had traveled over bridges and winding roads just barely above the surrounding ocean waters. I looked at the waves beginning to crash over the edges of the road and worried that we would have trouble returning. I also felt that whoever's had designed these roads had done a poor job.  That night I entered the auditorium and found that at the front of the building was a table above which was suspended the dead body of Aurora. I wondered if she was dead or play acting as that is something she would do. At first I was told that she had died of something trivial and entirely avoidable had help been around. Then I heard rumors that she had been partying and using drugs and had died of an overdose. I was shocked because she had always portrayed herself differently.  I lay down on the table and stared at her open and unbreathing mouth. I could see all of her teeth from an angle which was impossible. I hoped she would move or start breathing. My dad entered and approached and I felt a bit guilty for lying next to a dead body. He indicated I should come with him and I followed him back to the entrance of the auditorium. I then heard the creepy voice of Aurora call to me. She sang something to me in a high, clear, and cold voice. I knew that she was still dead.",

The proportions are about normal, but they are easily twice as big. Very new, spotless, grey, glossy. I finally do get on a bus.

They have to sort them quickly so they need to be as close as possible, but that means they are in danger of their heads being smashed and their bodies drowned.

Weird, old couples, rustics, weirdness. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to find the proprietor, who is across the way doing something in a recreation room of some kind. The people inside don't know what is going on. One couple leaves. They don't like the vibe. There was a much larger, more traditional hotel nearby. In the dream I wonder why I did not go there first. But I'm dubious that I'll find a room in that hotel either. It's in some small to medium sized city that is a tourist destination for some reason. It may have been that there was some kind of festival going on, not that there was any sign of it where I was. Finally I get out into the hall after I get Francine squared away. I don't have any food for her. May have been another dog in there too. I finally find a bowl that has some traces of dog food or some cooking in it.

It won’t be a real use of my skills, but it’s a great situation. She’ll pay me $4,518 a month to live in the house and to respond to calls and visitors. I will also have time to do some sessions. I’ll pay $505 a month for my room and board in the house. I’m sitting across the desk from her in her office. She has all the papers prepared with the tax calculations. I sign the papers and feel at ease. I can relax into this time with a steady monthly paycheck and a safe place to live that is run by people with integrity and enough money to be generous. In another scene, I’m standing in the rain outside Whole Foods. It’s dark. I’m with my mom and grandmother. It’s COVID times so we have to wait to get in. They let us in and we put our masks on. We can’t ask for help because people aren’t available in the aisle. We are looking for breadcrumbs. We separate and my grandmother finally finds the aisle with the breadcrumb choices. I was getting frustrated walking around and around the store. But my grandmother shows me options. There’s one with mushrooms, which I say no to because of my sister’s allergy. Another is made of potato chips and I think that could be interesting, so it’s a maybe. There’s another one with some other flavors in a big pink bag. None are exactly right, but I have to choose something and stand in line again to purchase it. In another scene, there is a group of men, mostly African American. They are setting up a nice area for themselves with a firepit, matching tables and chairs. They’ve created something beautiful. We are all sitting around outside in the dark around separate fire pits. Most of us are striving to get by and have mismatched sets of chairs and such.",

I hit my brother between the legs harder than I had intended to. He acted as if he wasn't hurt but from his voice he clearly was.   We were biking along the back roads by my apartment and get was ahead of me. He was pedaling furiously trying to stay ahead while I pedaled with ease but in an awkward position that made it difficult to go faster. I wanted to pass my brother and knew that I could. When we got to a steep hill, neither of us could keep biking and we had to walk. I think that I apologized for what I had done.",

I’m on the boat and know I need to run back to wherever I live and pack a bag. I need to pack a really big duffel bag because I’m taking as much as I can with me and I’m not coming back. I’ve been on the boat. It’s dark and dirty. Some of my friends are on the boat, too. They’ve packed really big bags. I start to run home through a neighborhood. It’s dark. I see my friend drive by me in a red convertible. She’s like, “Do you need a ride?” I say, “Yes and I’m going to need a ride back to the boat. I don’t want to miss it. Can you wait for me?” She’s like, “i can only wait a little bit because i’m grabbing something for someone.” I run into the house. I go to start packing my duffel bag. The only duffel bag I have is an old black and red one. It’s a bag I won in a golfing tournament that I worked when I was in high school. I still own this bag in real life. It’s big but not big enough because I’m not going to be able to fit all my clothes, winter clothes, makeup, toiletries and all of my witchy stuff like my tarot cards and whatnot. I’m going through all of my things and trying to be really discerning. I’m grabbing socks for different seasons and long johns for the cold. I’m trying to grab a puffy coat for winter but also balancing it out with summer clothes. I’m trying to be discerning as I pack because there won’t be enough room. I can feel that I’m getting frustrated. There’s a lot more to the dream. I don’t know if I even make it back onto the boat. I just know that it was important for me to get on the boat and there were a lot of others. Everyone is being sneaky because there’s something or someone trying to stop us. It feels like we’re escaping but I don’t know what.",

I’m watching leopards, I think, stalking each other and just generally exist in the undergrowth of the forest floor, like a rain forest. There are vines growing between trees and a lot of colors of underbrush. It’s quite lush. There are blooms, as well. The trees are tall and thin. I can see these large cats stalking each other in the shadows of the trees and pouncing playfully as cats do. Then I look from straight ahead to the left, so my head is turned about ninety degrees of what it just was. I see in the undergrowth a nest of kittens, really young, the kind that aren’t up and running yet, but folded in upon each other and sleeping as a unit. There are four of them. I’m aware that the mama is closeby but she’s stalking something. I just watch them sleeping. You can see the belly breaths, the way all babies do when they sleep breathe. I’ve missed a snippet. The next thing I notice is this long vine that’s being whipped back and forth so it’s really tight. It’s without discretion cutting everything it comes in contact with as it whips back and forth. It crosses over the nest of kittens and they are destroyed, splattered all over the area.",

It seems there are a lot of football players in their red jerseys. They have red towels pulled over their heads. The professor is getting ready to teach and trying to get the guys to take the red off their head. The door is open and we slip out of the classroom. We are walking in the dark. I have to pick up something for my mom. We’re wandering along a street. We end up at an old lover’s house where he is hosting a weekly meeting. The door is painted pink. I slip in first without knocking and go to the bathroom. The toilet is light pink and purple. When I flush, there’s slime in the toilet. I wash my hands and step out. Other people are arriving and are happy to be here. I’m a bit embarrassed. We leave. We’re in a big room in another house. Shoes are for sale here. Naseem needs new shoes. She wants a pair of tall red boots. There are also a lot of light purple boots. She thinks she can take them and walk out, but there are only single boots. She needs to find a full set but can’t. She would have to get help from a cashier but she doesn’t have the money to pay. She was hoping to just get what she wanted and walk out without paying. As she is trying a pair of purple boots, another box magically opens and there is a matched pair in the box. Naseem then pulls me into the bathroom to show me someone in there. A friend I used to dance with in college is on the floor of the bathroom, lying in a really odd pose, face down, back arched, one leg kicked out to the side. Naseem is concerned about her. I say she’s just choreographing a contemporary dance. I ask her if I can join even though it’s been so long since I’ve danced. She says yes. I suggest we rehearse in the dance room rather than the bathroom. I notice that her mind is a bit off.

They’re trying on clothes. It’s comical from my point of view. I’m lying in bed and watching these ladies try on their clothes and talk about their day. I don’t have any clothes on and am waiting for the room to empty so I can get up and get dressed. It never empties so I just get up and get dressed.

I'm in the living room and there’s stuff there, then I’m in the kitchen and there’s stuff there, then I’m up in the attic and there’s stuff there. There’s a whole other apartment’s worth of stuff in each room. Every room has everything in it that she’s ever had since she was a kid and it’s all just everywhere. It’s a mess and it’s not sorted. She hasn’t packed any of it into boxes and she’s asking me to help her, but she’s not ready. It’s a mess. It’s like trying to pack something that just keeps unpacking itself. At one point in the dream, I’m in the attic and my friend is there. It’s not like she’s helping, she’s just sitting there and she’s talking. Her mood is light and she’s making me laugh about a few things. At one point, there is a stack of toys that my daughter has had since she was a kid. They’re the toys she had between the ages of three and five. They’re in this big cube the height of my body and the same width. The cube is made of the toys. I’m reaching in and at first I’m pulling out things that are just garbage and I’m putting them in the garbage bag. Then I see a six-pack of bottles that I think are sparkling water.

I think you should have some of that. Let’s do it!” She pulls out two of the bottles and screws of the caps. We both take a swig and it doesn’t take like tequila, it just tastes like regular sparkling water. In the back of my mind I'm thinking that I don’t really want to do this because I won’t be present for what I’m packing.

We ran quickly and found one of them which we sent home. We tracked another to a fork in the road. One path turned right and looked easy, the other went steeply up hill. William and I inspected the ground by each trail to see if we could see tracks to indicate which direction the horse took.

We ran incredibly quickly and I noticed that I wasn't wearing a shirt and my pajama pants were so loose they were falling off.

We returned and ended up by the main road by the gorge. I saw the waterfall to the right of the dam and realized I had never seen it before. The road went over the water and up to the top of the dam. We were driving in my brother's car now and I was afraid that he was going to drive off the edge and drown us. I could tell that he was depressed. We for to the top and found that it was a rollercoaster that my brother had built. I wasn't sure it was safe, but we for into a car together, buckled in and shot down quickly gaining speed. We rounded corners jolting against the sides of the track. At the bottom we entered the water and began floating toward the stone wall near the waterfall. I was afraid we would sink and unbuckled, but William convinced me the car was buoyant so I rebuckled and we floated forward but we did eventually sink to the bottom. I was running out of air and was worried that even if I tried to swim up that I would drown.",

The train is going at a pretty good clip through some countryside and I take it all in with great interest. I'm surprised by how fast it goes around the curves. It comes to an area where the tracks are under construction or being repaired. Eventually there are no tracks, and the train is making its way over bare ground, gray or tawny rocks. Hilly at first, then level. When the train first enters the area of no tracks it sways alarmingly, then slows down and recovers. Eventually it starts to back up out of that area, and goes in reverse over the area it had gone over before. At one point I was surprised how wide it was. I was in a room quite a bit wider than any train would be.three times as wide at least. At another point I'm sitting and talking with a group of people. I'd been traveling with some friends but am not with them now, and had not been with them since the beginning of the dream. A middle-aged woman, gray hair, has her head in my lap. I'm trying to undo her braids so I can brush her hair, but I can't undo them. She says, it's okay, she doesn't need me to do that. She's quite pleasant as she says this.",

There was a bike in front of me and there were no wheels or anything around me. I was completely unprotected. It was in San Francisco and I was maneuvering my whole body using a towel or something, trying to stay on the road and eventually cut off on an exit. I passed several exits so I don’t know why we needed to get off. When I got off, I couldn’t find my phone and I was standing in this little median section. This group of young people came walking over from a party or something and pointed out that there was trash around me and that we had to stay far away from it. I started following them up the on-ramp towards a San Francisco neighborhood and listening to them having fun and taking pictures of each other and I was this totally different person. I went up into their apartment with them to use the bathroom but I knew one of them and there was music playing really loud and I was really happy that I didn’t have roommates in real life because this would be really annoying for me. There was a young girl home. She had stayed home while they were away and she was sick from chemotherapy. I heard her saying that to a friend and one of the friends who had been out walking back home from the party or something went to take care of her. There was some silver staining in the toilet that I went to use and so I had to have them pull it out. Then my dog Pinto was there slipping and sliding all over the floor and they said I could give him a treat and they were heart-shaped treats and butterfly-shaped treats and a bone-shaped treat. The girl said she was going to give him the butterfly one if we would just wait a few minutes. Then the parents of the sick girl came to take her away but all the sudden I was the girl and couldn’t tell you what day it was and I was really confused. It was a really disorienting dream, even the apartment loo (...)",

I go up the stairs with my son. It’s really crowded. There are chandeliers, elegant silver, waiters dressed in black and white, and customers in fine jewelry and clothes. I’m looking at the menu trying to decide whether we’ll stay or not and my son starts walking out the door. I think I’ll have enough time to finish looking at the menu before he gets too far, so I do. But I go out the door and he’s gone. He’s not on the stairs. I’m panicking because the stairs go down to the sidewalk and a busy street. I don’t know where he’s gone. In another scene, I’m on retreat in an urban spa. Two of my patients are there. We need to pick up some things so we can stay the night, or just go back to our homes and return in the morning. In another scene, I’m at the baths. I’m helping my son shower. A few ladies come out of the baths along with three cats - one black, one grey and one silvery white. I recognize the silver white one. I remember it belongs to Ursula. I also recognize the woman watching the cat, though not from waking life. The cat comes over to us and my son is petting her. I start petting her tummy. The woman comes over and introduces herself as Gipsha. She says the cat is 39 years old. She’s watching the cat while the cat’s owner, Ursula, is on retreat. I’m trying to pretend that I don’t know Ursula so that the woman doesn’t connect me with Ursula’s former apprentice.",

I order all kinds of food that I normally wouldn’t be able to eat, like pasta. At one point, I take my earrings off and they turn into fuzzy caterpillars. I also take my rings off and set them down on the table. The tablecloth is red and white checkered. I start to eat my pasta and it has marinara sauce on it. Then the server and cook come and sit down with me and have their pre-shift snack. So they’re eating with me. I think they’re eating the pasta, too. The noodles are the short curly noodles. We’re having a conversation and I’m realizing that they went out of their way to feed me even though they aren’t even open. Then I suddenly realize I’m eating pasta and maybe I shouldn’t be doing that. It doesn’t cross my mind until after I’ve eaten almost the whole bowl that this might have consequences. I finish. They clear the table and I grab all my rings and put them back on. I go to put my earrings back on but I can’t find them - the caterpillars.

Will and I were in a vacation room and packing to leave, there was drama about being there. It was dark. There were SO MANY clothes to pack for a weekend like a whole closet and he was yelling at me about it and how slow I was to pack and threatening to leave me because of it. I spoke up and said, “Go for it,” and that’s when he said he met someone else and just wanted to break up. He was drunk and slurring words. I looked out the window and saw a tiger walking down the street behind a woman and they went into an apartment building and I was frightened but like WTF. I saw closer that the tiger was a costume and all the sudden I was in an apartment across the street with children of Asian descent and they were all wearing tiger costumes and doing some form of trick or treating. It felt safer than where I was so I followed them. Then I packed my suitcase again and there was a stars jacket and I thought, “I have been meaning to donate this for my patients,” (I recently brought in a bag for our lending closet) but in real life I’ve never seen the jacket. It was navy blue with stars and moons. Will was taunting me the whole time and putting me down. I left and got on a plane to go get something from another island. We were in Hawaii, that's where he was stationed. I got off at the airport and realized I didn’t have my passport so I went to check. There was fresh French bread and cheese! Everyone walking out knew it was a thing and was ready to gobble it up as part of the experience. We were in France, not Hawaii. I found my passport and realized that my itinerary was outdated, it was from several years ago so I would need to purchase a new ticket and that’s when I woke up.",

There are street lamps that are gas powered - the old wrought iron kind about nine feet high. The streets are made of cobblestone and are a bit slick. I walk through the streets. There are some people around and they’re wearing overcoats and bonnets. The men are wearing hats with a brim in the front and back. The overcoats have a top layer that comes from the neck and goes over the shoulders to the waist. I walk for a while then I come to the place where I know I’m supposed to go. I open the front door and walk up the stairs to the second floor and knock on the door. My boyfriend from high school opens the door. Inside, he’s got art easels and papers and paints and everything strewn around. There are plates with unfinished food. His kids look like they’ve been there but they aren’t there right now.

I know this is typical of him, this is how he works. So I just sit and look out the window until he’s finished with what he’s doing. It feels like it takes ten minutes. Then, I don’t even know what he says to me. There’s just a break in the focus. I ask him how he’s been. I know I’m there because there’s something wrong with him but he doesn’t know this yet. Rather than say anything, he gestures with his arm that he’s been doing all this. He leaves the room and goes to a corner with a pile of stuff. He comes back with something and he shows me sketches. They’re quite good. It seems like he’s been working on this project. He starts to get his coat on. I know we’re leaving out the door to go somewhere else. We go back out onto the street.

I also wondered if it was really an earthquake but was surprised because we don't get such strong ones where we are.",

She setup a competition where we all played kazoos together as she player a piano piece. Each round was a different piece. The worst player each round was eliminated. On the third or fourth round,I was eliminated. I hadn't been on key and my timing was off, but I also had been attempting to harmonize and play using a more kazoo like style. I explained this to my mom but she didn't change her mind. I had made 3 points however and was told to pick 3 points worth of prizes from a nearby banker's box. We were all in the living room of our old house on UCF. I rummaged through the box but couldn't find anything good. All I could get for 3 points was sheet music to some songs I didn't like. One of them had the word \"Lird\" in it's title.   I was very annoyed at this point and complained to my mom. She ignored my complaints again and I left.   I was lying on my bed and could hear my mom playing a classical guitar piece from Estin. It was highly complicated and I didn't think that it would be easy to play on kazoo. I heard someone trying to play along on a guitar and thought it might be my mom. When I looked up, I saw that it was my dad sitting in a chair in the living room and playing a red acoustic guitar. He played well but had some work to do to get the song down. I went over and he began playing a beautiful piece that I didn't recognize. He then turned the guitar to an open D so that he could play the song more easily. He slid his hands up the guitar and played the new melody. It looked simple enough.",

I’m with Natalie, one of the owners of the Yoga Studio where I work and two little girls, maybe about ages four and six, somewhere in there. The kids are a lot younger so I’m assuming that they're two of her four kids, but maybe not. The bus stops and we all get out. There’s a baseball game going on in a field. The baseball diamond is at the back of a building. I’m not sure what’s going on in the building. It’s almost like a school meet and greet, it has that kind of feel to it. Natalie and the two girls go off and join up with the meet and greet. I’m more interested in the baseball. Because I’m not a regular player, they put me in the outfield, which is fine. I’m standing there, the way you would in the outfield, waiting for something to happen out there. I start to listen to the dialogue between the other outfielders. I notice that they’re mocking a woman. The mockery is to do with women is like, “Yeah right, they’re not good for baseball that’s for sure.” Then the men all laugh. I suddenly think, “Are they talking about me?” I notice that there are about ten outfielders and one or two other women while the others are men. At first I’m offended by this. I feel a little bit of umbrage start to rise up because I’m actually really good at baseball. They don't know this. I notice that although they’re mocking, they’re also smiling as though they also appreciate the fact that the women have some skills. It’s a strange mix of regard and disregard. As I’m noticing this, I'm also noticing their clothing. It looks like the kind of clothing that men in the fifties would wear. I suddenly notice they all have fifties style clothing with the vest overtop of the short sleeved shirt. I realize as I look at the women's clothing and the umpire wearing this heavy leather vest instead of the sleek light-weight material it’s made of now that it is the fifties.

I get up out of bed and go out into the living room, which is pitch black. My son and brother are on the couch but they’re both young, like six or seven. I’m like, “What are you guys doing here?” They’re like, “Dad just dropped us off.” I’m so confused because I just dropped them off at their dad’s house and I’m supposed to have all this time to myself and here they are and they’re sick. I’m trying to text my ex, “You’re supposed to have the kids right now. They’re sick. You left them here. I have plans for this weekend. It’s not my time with them.” My ex comes down from the stairs and starts telling me something. I’m like, “I don’t care what your story is and I don’t know why you’re in my house but you need to take the kids out.” I’m feeling super upset and start to feel that I have a sore throat in real life, as if whatever is happening in the dream is actually physically affecting me like I’m going to catch strep or something. This is something that did happen a lot when I was with my ex because he’s a strep carrier. In the dream, the kids are hot and sick and their voices are scratchy. I can tell they feel lonely because I’m trying to text their dad to come get the kids and then he shows up and argues with me about how I have to keep them. Then I start to get the sore throat in real life. Then the dream shifts. I’m with Josh at his house. He drinks coffee in the morning and I drink matcha. I’m trying to make my matcha and there are all these coffee mugs all over the counter and dirty dishes and water in the sink with soap and dishes in it and dishes in the strainer.

I hear the approaching sound of a helicopter and dream that one is going to land a stones throw away from me. It is getting louder and I plug my ears to protect my hearing. As the helicopter lands, the wind picks up and my kayak oar is starting to get sucked toward the helicopter. I'm worried it will end up hitting one of the passengers so I jump on top of the oar pinning it to the ground. My fingers are still in my ears.   A pickup truck with a trailer comes to take the helicopter away. I'm still lying in the grass close to where all of this is happening. The truck is too close for comfort and after the men load the helicopter onto the trailer the truck turns in my direction. I roll quickly to avoid being hit by truck and I go underneath missing the truck's wheels by inches. The wheels of the trailer though do run over me but didn't hurt as the helicopter was surprisingly light. I get up and check myself for any injury and walk over to the edge of the field where my dad sits at a picnic table under a pavillion. I join him and tell him what happened. He tells me I need to confront the men for their carelessness amd when they are walking in front of us he calls them over.  The men are all wearing helmets and the clothing you would expect from a cyclist. Their spokesperson had long curly dirty blond hair. I tell him that they ran me over and need to be careful.

They keep not getting the files together for the job they’ve contracted me to do. When I come into work to do my job, they’re scrambling around to find me something else to do.

This one particular day, it’s really vague what I’m supposed to be doing, but it’s something to do with documents. The documents are classified. They’re in sealed envelopes. I’ve been put on that job from my regular job because this time I have a shoulder injury. There’s a flashback in the dream to how I hurt my shoulder. The flashback is instigated by another peer, a colleague, asking me why I’m on that job today. There’s some inside jokes about the supervisor not having done her thing, like, “Oh, why are you doing this job this time?” They’re not making fun of me, they’re actually mocking her a little bit because she’s known to be disorganized. I tell them it’s because I was lifting weights in my room at home and I’ve been doing this for quite some time with success and building up the muscles in my arms.

So he leaves, and after he's gone I think, oh, God, he probably thinks I just wanted to have sex, but in fact that really was not my intention.  Weird. Why is he in my dream if he doesn't want to talk to me? Other examples of this.... what does it represent?",

I was carrying my dog Pinto in my arms the whole time. We kept getting off at the wrong spot and we tried to get through the gravelly areas, but there were people and dead bodies moving along with the gravel in the opposite direction. I heard someone in the FBI operations say while looking at a screen map of the facility that it is a super spreader concentrated wave of virus. Like they were tracking virus concentrations in the air at specific places and some were red. The crowds of people were white and wearing red shirts, some had funny looking jaws and no teeth, they were all packed in together. I tried walking down these steep slanted steps but I couldn’t see what step my foot would land on next and I didn’t want to fall, but people in suits rushed by me.",

I didn’t know where we were going, but it didn’t matter, it was a family road trip. I’m always only there just for the family time. I do get the sense there is wide open blue sky and red dirt. We come to a place where we stop. My brother lets me know that now we are going somewhere else, we’re not just driving around, we have a destination. We drive through a really dilapidated town. The sky has a certain color because it is reflecting a large body of water. It looks like water is not that far away. My brother drives the car through an area with houses. He says, “We bought a cottage.” I’m looking at a ten by ten shack. The bottom part doesn’t even have wood. I’m thinking, “Really, you bought that?” He says, “No. Turn around behind you.” I see a much larger building. It’s also not in very good condition, but it’s livable. There’s a great big backyard. We pull the car then my parents pull up - they’ve been driving towards the same destination - and then my other brother pulls up in his car. So we have three cars. My other brother has the trailer attached to his. We go in the house. We start opening windows, turning lights on, bringing some things from the cars - suitcases and stuff, but no furniture. The cottage is already furnished. There are three floors. The upstairs is a sleeping floor. The main floor is the kitchen and a living area. The bottom floor is one big long room with twenty tables with chairs around them. I realize as I’ve gone through all the floors that it has been set up as a retreat area. I ask my sister-in-law, “Are you guys going to start having retreats?” She says, “No, we’re going to set it up as a single family dwelling.” Then we start sweeping. We’re sweeping out the main floor first and getting the kitchen ready. My stepmom is doing some dishes because there’s dust on everything. We’re taking stock of (...)",

More people were showing up and the event became a funeral. Doug's family became the Davidson's family and it was their family that had suffered a death. There were a lot of children and they were in the living room making arts and crafts. I went in and played with the them the best I could. The children had made strange objects composed of many translucent and colored balls the size of oranges. One was given to me and I could see that it had as its center the face of a frog. I held it up to my own face and made ribbit noises.  Several of the children came over to me and rested against me or sat in my lap. I was a little worried abou this, but everything went well.  One of the children was a blonde haired girl who I though was one of the Davidson's girls. She was the one who had been born to a different father who she lived with. I think he was black. She was 17 years old and older than Sharon but she had initially looked much younger, only a small child. I felt guilty about asking her about her dad and she got up and left.  The funeral began and I went outside to meet others. I spoke with a few people and took my seat on the ground. It had been a hot day and I had been swimming with the children and didn't have a shirt on. I looked around and noticed that everyone else did. I felt very awkward as the funeral procession began and I wondered if I should go retrieve my shirt from my bag. Even then though I wouldn't be dressed appropriately.",

I’m with Josh and he’s being his charming self with two women and he’s convinced them both to let him eat them out at the same time. This makes me laugh and I’m also not wanting any part of it. I leave him to it and wander off out of this party. There’s somewhere I need to go, but I don’t know where and I don’t recognize where I am. I end up in the parking lot of an outdoor shopping area. Josh has this huge SUV, ridiculous in size, where it takes up the entire lane and two parking spots. He drives up and says, “Okay, I guess we’re leaving. Let’s go.” I hop in the car and he starts to drive. I’m not comfortable with the way he’s driving. He’s driving on the road then decides to go off-road and goes over curbs and at one point he drives through a park with green grass and tall trees. All I can see are the trunks of the trees - I can’t see their leaves or branches. He’s weaving through the trees. I’m like, “Why are we not on the road?” He’s like, “We’re just having fun.” I say, “Okay, but I’m not comfortable and I don’t like that we’re not on the road.” Eventually he gets back on the road. We pass my old grade school, which used to be an inn and they turned it into a school. It was a very beautiful property, but in the dream, it’s multicolored, painted different colors on different panels, it’s very clownish. We continue to drive. On the right hand side is another park. There’s a construction trailer on site and it’s painted in the same way as the building. In the dream I recognize it as my mom’s old work trailer where she used to do work out of, but in this reality she never had a trailer like this. We pass it.

Her name is Kali and the show is called “Kali’s Eyes.” I'm really interested in this. I tap on the arrow on the screen to get more information, but the app isn’t functioning well and I can’t find what I’m looking for. I am frustrated but I keep walking and hoping I’ll happen upon the event. I end up at a crowded venue. It looks like there will be a performance soon. I walk through the different rooms. Musicians are setting up. I see a guy with dreads who I think might be DJ Drez and some others. I could stay but I keep walking to check out the whole venue. Each room has a different feel, some with couches for lounging, some set up for lunch or dinner, some more open for music and dancing. I turn around to go back and now it’s really crowded. I’m trying to pass through the restaurant setting and there is a bachelorette party or sorority reunion. The women are crowded around tables that they’ve pushed together. I have to ask them to move their chairs so I can get through. I realize I can’t even walk through because the tables are pressed against the wall. I’m frustrated. It’s also still COVID, so it’s uncomfortable for me to be so close to so many people all crowded together. I do make it through by pushing the tables away from the wall just enough to squeeze by. I make it back to the more open room for music and dancing. People are more distanced here and tables are set up around the perimeter. I am uncomfortable because I have to sit at a table that’s already occupied by people who are in the stoned yoga art community. They kind of welcome me but I feel out of place.

There are various people out in the forest as opposed to being in the squat stone building that maybe people live in. it has the atmosphere of danger and some kind of threat. I feel like people have been fighting recently. There’s a woman and she has sleepy eyes and a drink in her hand. I think she’s drunk. She’s wearing a long cloak and has some small beads that she’s wearing on her forehead. She’s older. There are bodies lying around, too, I can see them. They’re knights and their armor has been smashed and dented. I’m also wearing a long gown covered with a cloak. I don’t feel cold, but I know I would be if I weren’t wearing so many clothes. I’m waiting for people and we’re supposed to be leaving to go somewhere. I see one of the people I’ve been waiting for, a younger woman and she’s garbed the same way we are. I can see through the evening a low stone building. It looks like there is a big stone wall around the building. It’s like a low big building with a defense wall around it. We’re waiting for one more person before we take off. We have to go across the creek and through the other side because it will be safer that way. The creek is frozen over. As I’m standing there, I’m watching an animal go across. I can’t quite see what kind of animal because it’s dark and I’m trying to figure out what they are. On the other side, I see a bigger roundish black animal and a very small one that’s maybe the size of a dog or a cat. As my eyes start to focus in on them and get used to the dark, I realize the small one is a baby bear. The woman beside me says out loud or telepathically that she has to go get that bear because it’s her spirit animal. So she starts to slide down the bank, taking small steps and sliding on her bum a bit. Everyone is quite respectful and nervous of the creek because we don’t know if we can break through or not.

The front of the building extends way out into the street and instead of just having a glass front, three of the sides are glass so it’s a lot more transparent and visible to people walking by. Before it always felt like a sanctuary with natural brick walls and the glass front and wood floors. In this dream it doesn’t feel that way. I’m standing at the front desk which is a lot bigger. One of the owners is there. The back hallway that normally leads into the studio is now a back entrance, so people are coming in the back entrance as well. There’s more than one studio now with two doors. I see my ex-husband and a bunch of his high school friends. They’re walking like a clump of high school age guys, pushing each other playfully and stuff like that. They walk in without checking in at the desk because they’re all self-absorbed. They just go down the hall into the studio. The owner is trying to piece together their names and check off their memberships for them. I’m thinking, “Oh great, they’re going to be in my class that I’m about to teach in a half hour.” I’m mentally rearranging my sequence so I can make it more physical because guys that age need that in order to focus and be present. So I’m just standing there in my head for a few minutes. Then a bunch of people come in through the back behind me. They’re also really loud. I don’t get to finish processing how I’m going to change my class in my head. They’re asking questions about the kids class. I’m like, “Kids class?

She’s trying to figure out who knows about the drugs. She’s closed out by everybody. Another scene: a forest, a large tree stump, wide and tall, about four and half feet tall and very wide. The stump is set up as an altar to Judas. I was going to do a ceremony for releasing the shame and betrayal of Judas. Ursula appears uninvited, adding things to the altar. Gemma appears with dried roses for the altar. Other women who were a part of the Priestess School who I don’t recognize arrive. I’m upset that they’re taking this ritual for themselves and somewhat including me but not acknowledging me.",

I’m with this man who is an actor in a show called “The Great” and he plays the Emperor Peter III of Russia and he’s nutty in the show. The character he plays is tyrannical and pretty uneven. I’m with him and other people. We’re floating and there’s a toy on top of the raft with us, too. It’s a little wooden truck with blocks in it and the blocks have numbers and the ABC’s on all their sides. I’m trying to keep the toy from falling inthe water and disappearing. I don’t know what we’re doing or saying, I just know we’re riding waves. It seems as if this guy, the actor, is a little bit crazy. I’m trying my best to placate him and do what’s needed to keep us from drowning and keep the toy from falling off. In my mind I know this toy is a rental, I’ve borrowed it and have to give it back. We head back to land, catching waves on this raft. The toy gets lost at some point, it falls off into the ocean. The guy says, “Oh no, you’ve lost your toy.” I say, “Yeah, but we have to turn it back in because it’s a rental.” He tries to help me find it. We find a bunch of toys but it’s not the one we had. Eventually we do find it and I turn it into this woman. The dream switches. I’m with all the ladies I have council with. We’re at a home, I don’t know who’s home it is. There are a bunch of cars on the lawn next to us and in the driveway of the home that we’re in. there seems to be cars everywhere, like maybe there’s a party next door. There are a bunch of cars that are our cars, too. If you go inside the house, it’s dark and dingy. A tv is playing and the furniture is gross. But we’re outside mostly on a picnic table. We’re planting plants into pots, at least I think that’s what we’re there to do. We’re there to make wreaths and plant plants. One of the sisters, Beth, comes and she’s like, “Okay, we’re going to do this but first we have to do our makeup.” It turns into a makeover situation and she has eyeliner and ey (...)",

I’m with my mom in the kitchen and my dad somewhere and my sister somewhere. My aunt is there, too. I guess the whole family that usually gathers for Thanksgiving is there. My mom is in the kitchen. I’m with her and we’re baking bread. The counters are already covered with loaves of bread. It smells so good! There are some artisan loaves that we’re just finishing up. We’ve just tried this new style of baking and we’re looking forward to trying it. I take those loaves out of the oven and place them on the counter. We slice some pieces of bread, sampling different loaves for the meal we’re preparing. I step out of the kitchen and walk down the hall. I go into my grandmother’s bedroom. This is when I notice the ceilings are really high and there’s a loft. Also, her bedroom is on the opposite side of the hall than it was in waking life. There’s a wall partition and around the corner is a big green bed, her bed. There’s a little area with toys - a little kids table and bright primary colors, a little hammer, balls and art supplies. She set it up for the grandchildren to play with. I see my aunt up the ladder on the loft preparing a couple beds for the family to sleep. There’s also a bed downstairs with a pink bedspread. We’re preparing the house so everyone can rest. I go out and see my sister and grandmother in the laundry room, which she also didn’t have in real life. They’re taking Christmas decorations out of boxes. They’re taking out candy canes that are individually wrapped in plastic, then wrapped again in bunches. My sister and grandmother are taking the candy canes out - they’re all different colors, rainbow, blue, purple, solid red. I don’t see the traditional red and white striped candy canes. It’s so good to see my grandmother even though I only see her from behind. It feels like Thanksgivings and Christmases in the past.",

The front of their house is decorated with so many succulents of all shapes, sizes and colors, some in boxes, others growing like vines. I comment that “Snow and Shelly” would like it. But I mean “Hanna” and I wonder why I keep calling her Snow? We continue to walk a little further. I hear them laughing about their friends “Slow” which is their nickname for Hanna and Shelly together. Then my husband and I get to the end of the alley. There’s a curio shop with all kinds of odds and ends. There’s a sign that looks like a fish and you can tell that it maybe once said Carmel, but part of it is missing so you only see the C at the fish’s face and the E-L at the tail. Then my husband reaches up and touches an interesting looking tapestry. He touches the border and tells me to touch it, too. It’s a really soft silky hair and leather texture, beautifully crafted. My husband takes it down and brings it inside. There’s an older woman dressed in a white lace bohemian dress behind the counter. There are two dogs running around. The dogs go from being really well behaved to one reaching for my fist with his mouth. While the woman is helping us check out, another dog starts running through the store and is being destructive. The man who is her husband and owns the shop with her comes out from behind the desk and goes after the dog to get him and rangle him back behind the desk along with the other one. I look at the tapestry and it’s no longer a rug, now it’s a dead dog that has been taxidermied. Now I understand why the leather was so smooth and shiny - it was once a shiny short haired soft dog. I don’t want it anymore. She says it’s really good for spellwork, protection and keeping the negative energies at bay.

I don’t have any need to let them all know that I already know how to do all of it. I’m just there with them, watching and observing. Each woman is taking turns and we’re creating a circle. The woman who is leading all this is standing in the center and each woman being initiated is walking in a circle around the other woman and the rest of us are watching. I’m part of the crowd watching the younger woman in the center. As each woman goes and does her initiation and shows what spells she knows, she’s walking around the other woman in a circle. The thing is, we’re all walking on water. The boat or whatever we were on is around somewhere, but we’re off of the boat and each of us is either standing on water or walking on water. You can see the shore from where we are and it’s a rocky shore. Then it’s my turn to go and walk on water in the circle. There’s a dress I put on. This dress is a purple taffeta, shiny and stiff.

I see one of the managers from the restaurant where I used to work, Blake. I don’t approach him yet. I go into one of the change rooms. Nobody is in it. I see one of those dropdown beds that you push into the wall. I drop it down and I lie down on it with my baby and I begin to nurse her. I finish that. She’s happy and fed.

The baby is liking this, too - I can see her smiling face inside her hat and she’s laughing. A good deal of time passes and I think that’s enough. We go back and I open the heavy arena door, it’s kind of hard with a baby in a sling in front of my body. I step down a step and go back to the change room.

I take a piece of my hair and I put it between the mouth of the curling iron and I pull the curling iron all the way to the end the way I’ve seen other people do, which actually straightens my hair, then I wrap the curling iron around my hair and I hold it and then I unwrap it. Instead of my hair being curly, it’s straight. I’m wondering why I’m doing this and don’t understand why I would do this. I have this dream consciousness that is confused and then there’s another consciousness that is also saying, “This doesn’t even work! It doesn’t even curl my hair the way it’s supposed to!” My son is only about eight years old in the dream and he’s occupying the other back bedroom. I know he’s there because I can hear him moving around. Since I hear him moving around, I’m trying to collect my thoughts on the two documents I’m writing on my laptop so I don’t lose my train of thought because I’m going to do a board game with him or something. I want to see what he wants to do now that he’s awake. It’s morning. I have been up for quite a while. He has just woken up and I can hear this because there’s movement. I look on the laptop and I’ve got one document open where I’m trying to collect my thoughts and focus for an upcoming court case with my son’s father. The other one is something that I’m writing as a creative project that I’m not sure is for school or just enjoyment. I click into the court case one because that one’s more important and has a date coming up soon. I’m trying to sort out the threads in my head of how the court date arose, what the reason is for it. It’s really hard to sort out because I don’t want to make it into an (...)",

He’s good friends with Gemma, maybe they’re lovers. I’m working on her but there are a lot of distractions and I don’t feel like I’m really offering a good session. I ask her to turn on her back. She keeps getting up and responding to his questions. He is asking her if she’s going to the dinner later. I’m included in the dinner invitation. I sort of finish and she says, “Thank you, that was really great.” I’m wanting feedback but there isn’t time. Some other things happen and it’s time to gather for the group dinner. I go by myself. A black man is checking names at the gate. The dinner is in a courtyard with a lot of tables set up. He allows me through. The guy behind me is also black and he can’t come in because he’s wearing velcro on his shoes. He walks away. People come. It’s kind of strange. There are some interesting relationships between all the people but I’m not quite sure what they are because they’ve all been living in community for so many years. I did something or said something earlier in the day that wasn’t entirely correct when we went swimming at the beach. I swam too closely to another person or said something i wasn’t supposed to say. There was something in my food or drink that knocked me out. I wake up in a big cage wrapped in this solid red Japanese raw silk kimono and bolster. I was passed out in this cage. People are walking beneath me and they’re much larger than me. I’m either really far away or I’ve been shrunk. A guy is pointing at me and talking about me being a rare form of butterfly. I stay still and pretend I’m asleep until they walk away. Then I get up and explore my cage. It’s quite big and extends back behind the metal display portion open to the public below. There are pipes that drip water into a bowl. There are dishes of food for me. The pipes are beautifu (...)",

Later when I went to the bathroom I saw him and his friends and younger girls joking around. Later I saw him sitting at the table alone. I went to the bathroom and all of these black beans started coming out of my mouth, not like vomit, but just like opening my mouth. There was this string attached around my epiglottis and wrapped around my teeth and I pulled and pulled and finally got it out and all of these beans kept coming, too. I went to go tell the boy he didn’t have to watch me anymore because I ripped it out and it was meant to be kind but he was so angry with me that I went to the bathroom and more beans came out. Then I went to go tell my husband and he was a hybrid of my ex Rory and someone I can’t place. I thought I could tell them what happened but when I started to he was putting arms around me to cuddle me from behind like I was a little spoon and instead trying to touch me sexually. I had to say I was sharing something vulnerable and he stopped but I could tell he was judging me for taking the cord out. I woke up feeling like there was a weight on my back and all hot and scared. And mad.",

I’m not sure what building I’m in, it’s got a sloped ceiling but the ceiling is also really high and there’s a little bit of slope to the floor. It’s almost like a lecture theatre, except there are no chairs. It’s supposed to have really good acoustics but it doesn’t because there’s so much background noise, but it’s not the students in the class that are talking, it’s students in the hallway and crowds of people outside. I can hear construction, jack hammers and buzz saws. It’s a cacophony of sound and so loud that I don’t know if I’m speaking or not. I can’t start my class. I go to the hallway, open the doorway and ask the people out there waiting to go into another class if they could please be quiet because they’re so loud. As I’m saying this, I realize there’s not supposed to be any talking in the building. So they say they will be quiet. I go back into my class. As soon as I start teaching, I can hear them again. They’re playing sports in the hallway, yelling and cheering. I can’t start. Then I’m sitting off to the side, I still have to sit there for the full hour, but I’m not teaching because I can’t. I see my brother. He’s not in the class, but he’s wandered up from the construction sight where people are building something. He’s taking a break. We talk for a few minutes. I feel really good to see him in my heart, I feel comforted by his presence. Then, it’s quieter. It stays quiet. I say I’m going to start trying to teach my class again.

I’m watching us drive through this cartoonish town and am still eating these berries out of a bag and off a twig. The twig looks like a curly willow twig. At some point there are worms and maggots in the blueberries and I’m totally grossed out and horrified. I take the berries and set them down in a little black cauldron like the ones we burn incense in and it’s glued to the dashboard of the van. I set this bunch of berries in it and all of these branches come out of the top so it looks like decor in this astro van on the dashboard.

I was going to move back there for the peace and quiet. The rest of the house was busy and full, but that room wasn't. Then it changes. It's now a room on the UW campus, down the hill towards the steam plant. It's all not quite as in reality, with some different buildings, but the lay of the land is close. The room is now a really nice bathroom with shower, like in an expensive hotel. There's a wall of glass, and it can be looked into from the outside. It's supposed to be vacant like my boyhood room was. I go down there with Adam, who's a kid of maybe seven, to look at it, and decide to stay down there. I send him back to wherever we had come from, the house, I guess. The room now has a bunch of college guys in there, in the bathtub, in the shower, standing nude, and a lot of high spirited carrying on. I'm a little put out because I had just wanted to take my bath and go to bed, but now I can't. I leave there and go back up the hill to where ever I had come from, and there's a fair number of people there too, but they're family and friends, not college students, and learn that Adam never showed back up. He's missing, and I'm very dismayed.",

They’re both retired, they don't have jobs, they don’t work. The reason I’m hiring this detective is because I don’t think they’re watching my son very well and I don’t think it’s entirely safe. They’re watching him for me because I’m working and I don’t have time to watch him and I need them to watch him for me while I work to make money. They’re in a pool on vacation or at the place they live. It’s odd that they’re together because they don’t really know each other in real life.

I’m sitting with a few people, some are part of the employees that worked there before the current owner bought it and some of them belong to the new owner. There’s a conversation going around the table about ideas on what to keep from the old owner’s arrangement of things, how to blend them in with the new owner’s ideas and flushing out the ideas of the new owner. We’re outside. I think I’m about to work there and have definitely not worked there in the past. I’m not really sure what my role is here other than I’m part of this conversation. A couple of the old things that occurred there are live music and wedding receptions. The staff are discussing those. The new staff think that the kind of music that accompanied the wedding receptions is dated. They give a few examples of songs that came from the 1920s that they are quite certain people don’t really enjoy now and so that needs to be updated. There’s also the issue of the furniture in the establishment. It’s old and dated, but there’s the idea that they want to keep some of the 1920s architecture and design of the building and maybe instead of having it be plain because it’s not that it’s worn, it’s that if it were actually the 1920s and you had more money, then the furniture would look more art deco and be more stylish. But because whoever owned the bar then was economically impoverished the furniture actually represents that. We’re talking about if it’s possible to upcycle the current furniture to make it reflect something a little more lush and festive but still of the 1920s era or should all the tables, chairs and counters and everything be taken away and start fresh? The other conversation at the table is the style of music. I’m actually contributing the idea of having an open mic night to see what kind of local talent exists in the area, then waiting until the open mic has run for maybe six months or a year before d (...)",

I’m wearing one pair of glasses and she has a different pair. There’s some kind of new protective coating on them that protects us from radiation. There’s some scepticism in the overall social culture about the effectiveness of these glasses. Hers are like the kind you can get at the drug store with different strengths of glasses, like 1x magnification or 1.5 or 2 and you can just walk in and buy them off the rack. Mine are prescription because I think the protective coating works so I got it on my glasses when I got a new pair this year. During the concert people are complaining that their eyes are hurting and they’re closing them and stuff, but we’re fine. Then a couple of people start to ask because we’re standing there and we’re not rubbing our eyes. Our body language is such that a couple of people notice we don’t seem to be experiencing any ill effects. So one or two people have asked my daughter: “What are those glasses you’re wearing? Are they protective somehow?” She says yes. She describes that hers are from the drug store and mine are prescription. They’re like, “Hmm, wow, maybe they do work,” kind of mutterings. Then my daughter and I just turn around and go out the door we came in. we go down the hall and then there’s an indoor pool. It’s the same thing where we’re not blinking our eyes rapidly because the chlorine is not bothering our eyes the way it does when you’re in an indoor pool area. I sit down to wait for her.

I don’t sit at one of the seats though, I’m standing at the back. I’m leaning against the back wall and just closing my eyes. I’m listening to the lyrics because I’m familiar with them. I’m really just wanting to enjoy how they’re paired with the melody. We’re about four songs in. He sings this one and it’s so emotional.

I’m buckling on a red one that goes from my ankle to my thigh and I’m admiring it with my leg out in front of me. I think the kids are there, or somebody, and they’re like, “Could you hurry up? You’re taking a long time and why do you need that?” I’m like, “Because I like it.” Then I get a black one. I go to put the black one on over and the balck one doesn’t have the same space intervals as the red (...)",

I order food and tell them that I will leave them a $100 tip. Tipping is an important part of this restaurant, but this amount was extravagant.  My food arrives and I hesitate to actually give a $100 tip. I think about $10 instead, but I stick to my word. They are very appreciative, a female cook especially.  Later, I meet up with the female cook and am given a reward. Every night a guest received a gift of some kind. She though it was fitting that I have been randomly selected after having tipped so much.  I had a job interview coming up with the cook's brother. She called him and began praising me highly. She heard that an amazing 19 year old had come to her and that he would be perfect for the job. She said things about me being kind, and also a Christian though not like many Christians she had met. I was surprised that she thought I was 19 when I was 26. Do I really look that young?   She hands me the phone telling me to say my birth date. I hesitate but say 1994 wondering if she will realize that I am not 19.",

You can feel it underneath the wheels of the car when the slush is so thick and heavy that it kind of pulls the car in the direction you’re not steering, so it’s a real struggle to let it go straight. I pull into a parallel parking space at the side of the street that looks very much like a street I recognize, which is supposedly the widest main street in Canada. I get out of the car and I’m standing on the sidewalk looking up. It’s an old railway town. The stores are made of the red clay brick and they go straight up because they’re tall and skinny and probably have three levels to the stores because they have to plus an attic full of old junk. I’m reading the names of the stores because I need some chalk paint. None look like they’re likely to have chalk paint, although one looks like a little bit of a possibility. I’m just about to walk over to it when I see someone I know from the old yoga studio I used to work at. She asks me what I’m doing standing there. I tell her I’m looking for chalk paint. I realize as I’m saying that she actually lives here. I add, “Do you know any place that would have some?” I briefly describe the project I’m doing and I tell her the look I want it to have because I don’t want just plain white chalk paint or anything like that. I want seafoam green and a chalky turquoise. She says, “Yes, I know the perfect place. It’s one block down that way and it’s called Moody’s.” I thank her and walk towards the direction she indicated. I’m standing in front of the store now and I have my son with me. He’s about ten in this dream. It doesn’t look like a place that would have chalk paint, although she said that it does and she goes there all the time and their selection is fantastic and she spent a few sentences endorsing it. So undaunted, I go in anyway. There are kids all in the front of the store and they’re unsupervised kids probably between the ages of six and eight, maybe (...)",

It’s very spacious and there is a lot of open space. The house is a house that someone is letting me and other people stay in. i’m the original person that the house owner let stay and I don’t know if I’m paying a really reduced rent or what. I’m the person whose name is on the lease or rental agreement. I have a bunch of other people living there with me because it’s a huge house. I’ve been on vacation somewhere and have just come back to the house. Josh is with me. He’s dragging his feet and is not excited about being back in this house. He keeps complaining about it not feeling like home and being too big. He’s also the only male in the house. The other people I’ve let the house out to are all women. When we walk in the door, there’s a bunch of women, all blonde and middle aged, very nice. They’re doing the dishes and cleaning up the kitchen area with the concrete countertops. It’s very open with windows that look out. I realize I have some things to clean up and am looking through drawers trying to find towels to mop up the mess. Then my friend, Nani from high school who I haven’t seen since she left high school her Junior year to move to California. She’s wandering around and is not talking a lot, she doesn’t have a whole lot to say. I go and follow her to the space she’s occupying. She’s taken up the den or the parlor. She’s put a bed in it and it’s super cute, I love the way she decorated it. It’s open to the rest of the house but you do have to go around a corner set of stairs to get to it.

Some of us just run and others are caught up by them or killed instantly. A couple of the women are carried off. We don’t know where to go to hide from them because there’s just more of this wide open plains area.

All day long we spend driving these stakes into the ground so they stick up about six inches from the ground and about six feet apart, but they won’t be able to see them because they came at dusk last time and we know they’re going to do that again, probably at dusk.

I don't remember whether I was guilty of any such crime.  They were going to arrest me so I put my hands behind my back so that they could tie me up. I was showing weakness by doing this as I wasn't sure that they were planning on tying me up at all.  They did tie me up and took me to an empty holding cell with a stone floor. I had some friends who were on my side and planning to help me escape. We must have been part of a resistance group. Two men entered my cell, one was my friend trying to rescue me, and the other was my husband. I was apparently gay in this dream. My friend had convinced my husband and to help him but has somehow gotten him to admit that we were married which was against what the religious authorities approved of. I was further worried that this friend had only been able to get this information from my husband by seducing him.  My husband came over to me and we had sex.",

We got to the party early and deposited our food, drinks and gifts. I looked around but didn't recognize many people apart from the hosts and the Davidson family. I was glad that I did not see L. D.. I mingled a bit among the crowds.  A video began playing in which Stephen announced their nee baby and requested any financial support that we could provide. He said that despite what we might think they were really poor and needed money for the child. I remembered having given them money the two previous years and decided that I would again give $100.  I noticed that I was barefoot and was a little worried this wasn't acceptable, but we were in a carpeted room and many others wearing sandals and flip flops. We sat down at a table with Stephen and Sarene. My mom was there and spoke to Sarene.  Sarene looked a lot like Pam Beasley from The Office. The dream transitioned and I watched as a murderer took her dead body and arranged the arms and legs, folding them elegantly around the protruding stomach. Somehow the baby inside was allowed to develop though the mother was dead. Toward the end of the pregnancy the killer disemboweled the body and out rushed a torrent of blood and guts. It was horrible and I willed myself to wake up. Once awake, I wished that I had remained asleep so that the dream could finish its narrative.",

I've passed through the campus and am walking on a walkway. A lot of students are walking the same way I am. I realize that the pathway leads to a large parking garage, and that the students are heading to the garage and will then drive home. I have no car. I get through the garage and follow the path that begins to ascend a a really steep and fairly rugged, big hillside. I get up to a little elevation, and see a really remarkable landscape of distant peaks and glaciers, through a window. Not as dramatic, perhaps, as the west coast, but big enough. It looks like a subarctic wilderness. I continue to follow the path in the hopes that I will eventually get to the top and that there will be an airport somewhere that I can get to. I come to a place where there's an enclosed area. The path that had been precarious and narrow widens, and there's a snug, little, rustic sitting room. A fireplace. May have seen the view from here.

I asked him what I should know and he said that I should find my purpose in being here but remain no longer. I walked for a ways making little progress. I asked another traveler what lay ahead.

An animated spirit. \"You know these waters won't heal you, don't you?\" He asked cheerfully. \"Yes,\" I answered,  \"I'm only resting for a moment. Why are you here if you know?\" \"I know but I still can't stop myself from hoping.\"  I left and saw candles lit along the path to guide travelers.

Asks me if I want to get lunch now. I say yes, I've been on for hours already. Not that I'd done much, and when I say I'd been on for hours I feel a bit stupid. But I could use a break. He says, you can find us in \"Children's World.\" I have no idea where that is, and I think to myself that before I get anything to eat I should find out where it is. After the superior teacher says that he and the kid dive into a channel of water, artificial, above ground, a kind of sluiceway, perhaps. The water is not moving very fast, but it is moving. Lined with pink concrete. Apparently he had a penchant for diving into water. I fly, rise up to about fifty feet. Somehow no one thought I could do that, but I do it anyway, and fly along, well controlled. maintain altitude fine, but don't see anything resembling what might be Children's World.

I was captivated. I marvel to myself, this is in Middletown? How did I not know? This is great! Mom and Manuel are sitting in the balcony in the theatre auditorium, and I'm with them, but for some reason I go somewhere else, and it turns into this whole, long thing. I'm carrying a pair or two pair of shoes, and some other stuff. I progressively lose most of it. I then have an odd shoe from each pair, and they're mismatched.

I was surprised to see anything like that in Middletown. Centerville? The performance is over. People are leaving, although there are still a fair number of people sitting in their seats, and I can't seem to find my way back to the area of the balcony where Mother and Manuel were sitting.

The tobacco's been shaken out and the end twisted up to make a poorly formed, stubby thing. I take it that there's marijuana in it.

I picked one up and it wasn't as heavy as they had made it out. I walked between the two of them across the room through a doorway and to some stairs. The staircase was impossible and made no geometric sense. I almost walked off the edge to where the staircase was half a story below. I managed to get down the stairs but then had to go up a few steps to make a 180 turn to go back down. In the room, I asked if they were practicing music. They said no, that they were going to have a private discussion and wanted to play music.  I finished setting up the speakers and with some difficulty got everything plugged in and working.",

There was a manmade hub island or dock out there and people navigating on jet skis in a hurry like we were preparing for something serious. Someone said “I’ll show you when you wake up where we are going,” but I couldn’t see them. I became a leader and we needed to pull this big ship to the shore. I took one of the ropes and was doing a knot over, under, over, under, or over and I asked the people if I was getting it right and I pulled a ship on the shore. Mine was the last of three ropes. Then for some reason I was crammed in with a bunch of people somewhere and we were part of a retreat I think. It was like I was in a dressing room with red velvet and gold curtains. There were three other people I don’t know. This young guy was really upset and talking about “I have a kid, I just graduated Pasadena, I work at a grocery store” and he was saying this wife and kids are who he lives with (and he looked really young) and he said his kids just graduated from high school but they were 29 and I was so confused. We were all trying to get to the beach and be nice as strangers finding commonalities and comforting each other. We were also close together without masks on now that I think about it…",

I make it through the forest without being attacked by snakes. I come out in someone’s backyard or a recreational area with an in-ground pool. I see some people I know - the Jones family. I know the mom and one of her sons. The mom sees me and waves me over. I go and sit with her as she indicates - in front of her. We’re sitting in outdoor lawn furniture and there’s an umbrella over our heads. She’s talking because this is her family reunion. She’s describing the relationships she has with everyone. She’s animated and enjoying this conversation. I certainly don’t mind listening to her describe her connections and her joy with her family. Then she asks me if I want to swim. I happen to be wearing a bathing suit underneath my dress and tell her, “Yeah, that would be great.” I get in the pool. I’m swimming around, just enjoying the water. There are a lot of other people in the pool. At one point I lean back against the edge of the pool and put my elbows on it and lean my head back a little, letting the rest of my body float up near the surface. I’m just lightly moving my feet to keep my lower body afloat. My mind kind of drifts away. I’m aware of other people there but I’m just enjoying the sun. There’s an intense blue sky above me. I’m in the water and it’s just nice. But then the laughing gets closer and becomes more sporadic so it disturbs my reverie. I open my eyes and let my feet float down towards the bottom of the pool.

All of a sudden it springs, it recoils, and it shoots itself maybe three or two feet away from me. It does this so quickly that I scream.

She's pleasant, but intense and focussed on her task. I ask if I can have a word with her.

She gets it, and says something like, there was some stuff that followed on after the class, that was real political organizing, but you need to do something to register for it, send a check that day. I wasn't going to do that. Then I feel a little better. There was a large, glass sphere, perhaps ten or twelve feet in diameter, that was floating in an artificially dug pond. It was lovely. the glass was blue and textured in places, and there were patterns of swirls and areas of darker and lighter blue, lovely shades of blue. The glass was quite thick, and not chipped or marred in any way. It was a bit dirty, though, as it had been rolled around on the adjacent lawns, so there was grass and mud and sand adhering. I roll it around in the water and it cleans up. I tell this instructor what I had done, and she's pleased. She had put some cleaning solution on it, and I say, oh, that's why it cleaned up so easily.

I go into a wooden building and run into, dunno if he's a prof or what, but he's native or part native, and he's going to conduct this seminar I'm going to be in, and was in the previous term. He wants to have a meeting about the upcoming seminar right then and there. I explain that I don't have the time at the moment, but have time tomorrow and could participate then if I know when and how long it will last. He's okay with that, but his manner is somewhat dark and overbearing. I say I can give it a few minutes now and sit in for a bit. It turns into this thing where he asks us to propose names for Native families in the modern, Euro-dominant sense, or clans in the traditional native sense. The ones I and this other guy had proposed were wildly inappropriate, wrong, culturally insensitive, maybe even racist. He's not very nice about it. I am dismayed, and I'm not at all used to being treated this way, with disdain bordering on contempt. I'm totally open to learning, but I don't like his manner or how this is playing out. Feel like I'd been set up, definitely blindsided. There should have been some instruction around the topic, and the meeting should have been scheduled. So I leave and go back to the car where Megan is waiting. I tell Megan I'm not going to do that seminar. I dread the thought of being in that seminar. I'd have to do vast amounts of research. Didn't like the confrontational, gotcha way he was operating, or his attitude. We drive north. Question, are we in Lynden yet? Is somebody following us?

There are a lot of windows but no design or creativity to the architecture, it’s just put together. The dream begins on the bottom floor. There is one couch and a whole bunch of boxes of clothes. I’ve brought one of them here with my daughter’s clothes from where she was four and five. I brought them because her godparents at the time, their daughter is three and most of the clothes have only been worn a couple of times so they look brand new, including this pair of white girls shoes that you put on for special occasions. She only had them on for one two-hour thing, it was a funeral, and I carried her for most of it. The godparents are looking through their daughter’s own clothes trying to find a pair of shoes. I tell them that there’s a pair that I brought in the box of clothes. The godmother says nothing and continues to look through the boxes of clothes as though I haven’t spoken. Her husband says, “Oh thanks, that would be great! Where is the box that you brought?” I tell him, “I put it over there.” He goes that way and starts looking for it. In the meantime, I’m sitting on the couch with their daughter. She normally doesn’t laugh and I know this. She doesn’t express her emotions very well. I’m very careful not to pick her up and toss her around the way some adults do with the kids or disrespect her space. I just sit on the couch and if she wants to come over, she will.

I’m really paying attention because I think she has some wisdom that has perhaps been overlooked due to the fact that she’s in a three year old body. She eventually toddles over and sits on my lap.

I end up with a fair pile of stuff. It's manageable, just. I haven't lost anything. Then an a conversation with Darlene. She wants to know how I'd arranged, or what was the deal, for the long break I'd been on, because I'd been away from teaching for some unspecified period of time. I said, I went for full retirement. I sucked every dime I could, and I'm still sucking. She chuckles. We talk a little about the principal, Lisa Day. I say, I haven't seen her since I came back. Forget what Octavia says. Then Lisa Day starts talking about her strong sexuality. The second she gets home she wants sex. I don't say anything. At one point I'm thinking to myself, no wonder I dream so much about being rehired at Palantino, because I actually was. [Dream logic! Obviously not lucid.] My dream must have been foretelling that. I accompany Octavia down a wide hallway. Then I plan to go back to a pile of stuff and take what I can out to the car. I float along, and bump into some other woman teacher.

I walk around it and get a really good look, because I'm very intrigued. Doesn't occur to me that I'm dreaming, though. It has steam up and the propellers start to turn, churning up gravel and earth. Makes no sound, which in the dream does not strike me as unusual. I did think that a ship on land was odd, though, and was very curious about it. The ship slowly begins to move, and is headed for the water. Scenes inside the ship, in a salon and some passageways. I had a sense I had been there before. I look at a display of photos from 1919 National Geographic or similar, all very period, and a young woman in period style, an article about the ship. I'm looking for a bathroom, find one and think I hear light snoring, so I don't want to go in that one. As I come back around there's a fair number of people, forty or fifty, in a room, even though in the dream it's very early in the morning. I walk a little farther on and find a second such room full of people sitting in chairs in rows facing forward, as if they are getting an orientation or instruction of some kind. Around some passageway there was panelling and wainscoting. In my earlier period of time there, when the ship was much less busy and frequented, I had spent quite a bit of time on it. There was some weird foam-taped areas of bulkhead that looked pretty jerry-rigged. I pick at it a little and it comes away easily, so I leave it, as I don't want to damage anything.",

It passes within inches of other traffic, city buses and parked cars, but never hits anything. It throws water and dirt up from the tracks. The tracks are set in the street, not raised above it.

I want him to stay longer. As we walk a little farther on, it’s really pretty. It’s a white sand beach and there’s a moon. You can tell the color of the sand because the moonlight is bright. We approach a path leading down to the beach from somewhere else, and I can see it in the darkness. We turn up it and start to move away from the beach. There’s a night market with crafts and people who have made crafts and set up a makeshift vendor tent out of a few simple poles and some canvas or fabric. There are a lot of these makeshift tables. There’s a camaraderie kind of atmosphere as we walk through. They’re background noise though because we’re in conversation with each other and we’re walking through the market, we’re not stopping at the vendors or looking at their crafts or what they have to offer. We come to another path. We turn up it, away from the vendor market. It’s like beach apartments, flat, one level and very simple, obviously places where people sleep because the sound from the market and ocean is reduced here. I suddenly realize that I don’t know where we’re sleeping - I don’t know where he’s sleeping or where I’m sleeping. I’m getting tired and want to lie down and rest. He says we can sleep here for the night and indicates a door on his right. He says it belongs to his brother. So we open the door and right inside the door is a bed. We lie down on the bed and I close my eyes for a few minutes. I wake up and feel like it’s not that much longer but he’s behind me and his arm is around me. It feels soot (...)",

We're on the upper deck, outside. He's been fairly standoffish, not to say hostile, but quite cool. Leave me alone, I'm not interested vibes. I'm very aware of him. At one point he either has or is a black cat, and is sitting on the rail. Then he backs up and goes over the rail, but is still hanging on by his front paws. I think he is going to fall overboard, but doesn't. He gets rescued, gets hauled back up, forget how. I'm in an apartment, possibly mine. Same guy, and another guy who is not so standoffish, and shows a normal willingness to enter into conversation. And a woman. She and the first guy, she's going to drive him somewhere, possibly to his home. And the second guy is not going with them. I could go if I want, but I decline. After they leave I talk to the second guy a little about the first guy. Inside the apartment I can't see whether it is day or night but have the feeling it is night also.",

    "text": "b. Palantino. Pretty close to as it was in reality. I'd spent the night there, together with the entire staff and students, the night before the first day of school. I had some materials for the first day, that I need to photocopy. Some news articles and some images, and the kids were going to answer some questions about them. Forget just what the sleeping arrangements were, but I'm just waking up. It's barely 5 am. School doesn't start until around 8. I gather up my stuff and want to get the materials copied. I walk over to the admin portable, and meet Ron Hitchens. I ask him where's the best place for me to make copies? It had been a long time since I was there. Takes him a while to answer. He suggests a classroom. There wasn't a copy machine in the room where I had spent the night. But then he starts hemming and hawing, and finally suggests I come into the admin portable. I meant to ask him where the mailboxes were but never got around to it. It occurred to me that I had not planned the lesson well at all. I had way too much stuff to cover in one class period. I wasn't too sure how it was all going to work out. Ron is smoking a cheroot, about 4\" long and half an inch thick, fairly dark brown. Don't recall that he gave me one, but now I have one. I meet the principal that succeeded Ron, Melissa (blanked on her name when recording the dream). Am I smoking the cheroot? I think so, or had smoked it earlier but it was now out. She sees it and I say, look at what Ron Hitchens is smoking now. Her eyebrows are raised. She wants to smell it, I assume to see if it's marijuana. I say, oh, it's tobacco, all right. I'm stupid, but not that stupid. Totally realistic. At one point a student asked me, what are you going to teach. I answer, oh, the usual English and social studies, but in fact this answer was not entirely accurate. I didn't have a grade book or roster. I just assumed they would be coming in due course.",

I just know I’m with other people and we’re all looking at houses together. There’s one property with three houses on it. All the houses are painted white and the insides are painted white. They kind of look like plantation homes that you’d see on Hawaii where the sugar and pineapple plantations are. They’re really open floor plans, a single wood wall, big windows, wood floors and interesting layouts. The grounds in between each house are pretty well manicured with short palms and hapu’u ferns so I must be in Hawaii. I’m looking and we decide not to buy it because it’s too much. Then I come back to this house later in the dream and later in my life. I think I'm with someone but I’m not sure. The house has been bought by friends. I come and look at the different houses. They’ve remodeled a bit and the houses aren’t white anymore. They’ve got red accents on the insides. Whoever I’m with, I’m not comfortable with them. I’m also here to see the daughter of the family that owns these homes now. I’m not sure who it is; it’s a female person and we’re not really friends. It’s kind of like I’m trying this out to see if this is a friendship I want to have but it’s not. I feel awkward being around her the whole time. We’re in one of the side houses, not the main house. It feels so awkward. I’m not comfortable. Her parents are there and I just want to leave. She actually leaves before I do. She clearly doesn’t feel a connection either, so she’s just gone. As I leave, I’m getting into my car and driving away from the house and I get the sense that I’m driving away from a house and a town and a community completely. There wasn’t really resonance there anyway. I don’t know where I’m going, I just know I need to get away from that place because it’s just not for me.",

It’s the kind of stairs that you pull up and hook so it forms a floor. When you want to go into the crawlspace, you unhook them, lower the stairs and then you can climb down. The washing machine and dryer are down there. I need to change my clothes because they’re wet. I’ve got a spare pair of jeans that are Omar’s. I’m holding them over my arm as I climb down these stairs. You have to hunch over to make yourself shorter in order to go through the crawlspace, but once you get over to the washing machine and dryer, you can stand up. I’ve done this and I’m there. I’ve taken off my own wet clothes and put them in the dryer. I’ve forgotten to be careful as I’m putting on the dry jeans. I hear a sound and stand up really quickly and turn around. There’s a light bulb screwed into the ceiling and my face meets it as I’m turning around. Because I’ve started and done it with such force, the light bulb breaks and it cuts my face and now it’s bleeding. I turn around and Omar is standing there. He says, “You’re bleeding. What happened?” He comes over and finds the cut which is on my nose. He tells me to sit down so he can pinch the two sides of skin together to stop the bleeding. He’s talking to me as he’s holding it. I still feel traumatized. I’m just listening to him. The sound of his voice is calming me down. I go to stand up because I want to clean my face and arms. He says, “Wait, it’s not ready.” I try to stand up anyway and of course it wasn’t ready and the skin breaks apart and the bleeding starts. This time when he puts my head back in his arms and squeezes the skin together, I decide I’ll just listen to him. Eventually he says, “There, I think that will hold now. It’s okay, you can get up.” I get up, climb back up the stairs and go to the sink in the kitchen and start to wash the blood off my arms. Blood is all over my wrists, my forearms, my (...)",

The tide coming in as high as it was, was an unusual event that we recognized as significant.  We saw the water lapping against the roots of the trees. I worried the forest would be destroyed. We decided to climb the cliff to get to higher ground. It was difficult and I worried that I would be swept away but I made it.   At the top there was a stone tomb.

I’m with my dad and we’re planning to go to Niagara Falls and spend the day at the amusement park. There are some other kids going, too, and I think they’re just friends of mine. I’m teenage me. I’m talking with my dad about what rides we’re going to go on. We discuss the fact that it’s cold and we’re going to need to wear extra clothes. So there are some conversations about what we’re going to bring because we don’t want to carry too much but we want the right things for the weather. I’m excited about going. My ex-best friend who I was still friends with when I was a teenager, calls on the phone and I tell her that we’re going. She says she’s going to meet us there because she’ll be in the area. She asks me what time we’ll arrive. I tell her we haven’t finished figuring that out yet and I’ll call her back when my dad lets me know. I hang up the phone and it suddenly dawns on me that the reason the amusement park is still open right now and not crowded is one of the reasons we decided to go. It’s not normally open this time of the year when it’s cold and near Christmas. We also wouldn’t go to an amusement park because it’s so crowded and the lineups are too long. I realize that these criteria are in existence because of COVID. It sinks in that we also should not be going. We can't bring all these people together, we can’t circulate through the park. I feel this moment of rebelliousness where I want to go anyway at the same time I know we can’t and we won’t. I voice this to my dad. He doesn’t say anything. He silently realizes the truth of this, too. I pick up the phone and call my friend back and tell her we won’t be going after all. She asks me what I’m going to do. I tell her I’m going to be home but we realized that the reason the amusement park is open later in the year and there’s hardly anyone there is because of COVID so we can’t go.",

There are wooden bowls full of things, one has acorns in it and another has bits of yarn, some have other things. It’s an odd assortment of stuff that could possibly just be junk. It looks like things people would put in a daycare on a kids craft shelf so they can glue them on paper, like bits of macaroni, buttons and things like that. I’m sorting them out. I see my cousin and her husband come in. I see my other cousin and her husband, too, and another cousin, only she looks different and I can’t tell if it’s her or someone else. Maybe it’s her with someone else’s face but she’s not alive anymore. Here she is and she’s acting like Nancy but she doesn’t look like her. We’re deciding to go on a hike.

See if they fit.” I pick the crate up and bring it into the room where she’s sitting. I start to unwrap the shoes - they’re in tissue paper. The first ones, I show her the soles. The heels are really high, the sole on the ball of the foot is quite tiny, like a triangle, and the spike at the end of the heel is made of something that curls rather than just a flat piece.

I walked into a room with a patient on the table and they said “how long was he gone? It seemed like he developed another consciousness in a short time when he woke up with somebody else,” like a patient died but they woke up and they were somebody else. I walked by shrugging my shoulders like “yup, that happens!” It was very nonchalant. Pinto (my dog) and I are in a different apartment and I don’t think I am me now. It was vintage modern design and had a lot of dog toys including a play castle that took up a lot of space. He wasn’t able to play on it much but it was his favorite (no idea in real life). There were workers not wearing masks in the hallway and I yelled at them. They were putting a clear outer door over all the unit doors. It was a hallway that looked familiar but not mine (like the apartment). Pinto and I went to go see dog friends, Chuck and Trevor, and somehow Chuck was a small dog maybe a wiener mix. I knew that I used to have them together or that they belonged together. Then he morphed into a golden red Chuck similar to now but younger. Trevor was there and the same as he is in real life. We were on wooden outdoor stairs over water, maybe at a wharf, and the leashes kept getting tangled but I couldn’t see the other owner. I assumed it was my ex Rory, but it was like we didn’t know him.",

I’m showing them how to get over a barrier that looks a lot like the plastic plexiglass barriers that we have up now because of coronavirus, between cashiers and people. The barriers are really tall and kind of remind me of a hockey rink. The panels are skinny and narrow though, attached to a solid unbroken bottom foundation. The plexiglass panels bend a lot because I can pull them down almost in half and climb up over them. We climb over them. I don’t know where we’re going, I’m just showing them how to do this. We come to this lake and I’m having a psychic energy session with a psychic, but I don’t know who she is. It’s actually not just her, it’s a whole council of beings so I’m wondering if this is my own council. I know they do some energetic work, but I have one last question for them. I’m like, “Hey I haven’t bled in a while. What’s going on with that?” I’m thinking it’s menopause or something. The guide, a woman with short blond hair, says, “Oh let me look.” She looks and says, “That’s because you’re pregnant, kitten.” She calls me kitten! I’m like, “Oh god, nope. This isn’t good.” I’m not excited about this. I don’t see the other guides in front of me, they’re kind of like a voice in my head because I’m now back at this lake. It’s dark around me and the water is dark. I’m standing on an island. The people I’m with are constantly shifting and changing. I don’t see who they are and don’t recognize any of them. There’s a guy who looks a little like a Star Wars character, the guy who plays Hans Solo and Leia’s son. He is throwing things into the water. I see him pick up a baby by a foot and just wing it into the lake. I’m like, “Is that your child?” He’s like, “Yeah, but I don’t want it and I don’t need it.” I’m like, “If you do that, it’s going to die.” He’s like, “Yup.” I’m shocked and I watch the baby land in the water and never come back up again.

One room is a barber shop, another is a restaurant, and there are other rooms and businesses, but these are the main ones I’m aware of. Our plan is to keep the restaurant going and revive it, then maybe turn the other rooms into living quarters for all of us. I don’t know who this collective is, though. Just after we close the deal a broker comes in and he’s upset because we signed the papers so quickly and overlooked some important limitations around the building and modifications. He points at the barber shop and says, “See these chairs? They are historically protected chairs so you won’t be able to change them.” We’re a little downhearted and then think maybe there’s a way to work with the chairs and fit them into the redesign, so we’re not too upset. Then the dream continues but shifts. I see a map and then am driving on one of the roads on the map near the building. I’m helping a woman buy a trailer to escape her crazy ex-husband. We find a place in a little neighborhood in the woods. It seems protected, isolated and hidden enough that he won’t find her. There are a series of winding roads, checkpoints and trees. The trees look like guardians. I can see in the bark of one tree, the design of a woman. We start to move her in. Across the dirt road is a sculpture - a bust of a white woman with big red lips and yellow blond hair. She looks out of place. They’re moving rocks around to build another one so the two sculptures are at the head of a driveway. They’re putting gravel down for the driveway. I’m curious about these neighbors and want to meet them. Anita is with us here. She’s talking to me about our friendship based on our time together at Burning Man, but how she also has professional boundaries and there are things she might do that don’t feel friendly. I don’t understand until I’m working with another tech person. S (...)",

    "text": "“The Coffee Pot” I’m standing on the sidewalk of an avenue that has wrought iron gas powered lamps. It’s snowing out. There’s already about a foot of snow on the ground and it’s still snowing. There’s a little shelf of snow overtop the tree branches and street lamp and on the railing of the porch where I live. The porch is a nice porch; you can walk up the stairs and there’s lots of space and you could comfortably sit there at a table and chairs if you wanted, but I don’t. The house is brick. It’s beautifully architected, two or maybe three stories with an attic at the top. The roof comes to a peak, it’s taller than it is wide. It’s old. I can tell it’s old because the glass isn’t flattened by a machine, it’s hand-hammered. I can feel all the care that went into the materials that created this house. I’m looking underneath the bench for my coffee pot. It’s a coffee pot that sits outside my front door. The bench is built right into the deck like a wood shelf, just a simple bench you might sit on to take your boots off or something. It likes to roll underneath there. I say ‘it likes” because it seems to have a mind of its own and I find it in various places around the house, sometimes it disappears but it always comes back. It’s about eighteen inches high, comes up to about my knee and it’s mostly black. It looks like it’s made of cast iron but it’s not because it’s light when you pick it up. I think it’s this material that allows it to flit in and out of this world. It’s long and skinny with a pointy lid. There’s a shinier tarnished silver around the rim of the lid, the point of the lid and a couple bands around the long slender spout that curls up and around at the top. It’s definitely a mischievous coffee pot. I give it space. When it disappears I’ll sometimes look for it. I’ll brush the snow off it then set it back down on the porch as though I like to tell it where its place is in a playful way because I know it’s going to disappear and come back again.

We all seem to know each other. I’m wondering where my son is. He comes in and passes through. Then I don’t see him for a while. I assume he’s with somebody who’s watching him. The guy from behind the bar comes over to my cup because I’ve asked him for a tea strainer. Instead of giving me a tea strainer, he pours warm milk into my cup. Then he pours a huge amount of loose tea, so much so that it is overflowing from the cup. I’m surprised and ask him what he’s doing. He says, “Oh it’s really, really good tea. Just wait and see.” I think he’s ruined my cup of tea so I sit back and let it steep, whatever he’s done. I start to get worried because I haven’t seen my son in a while.

I explained that it was because it existed and was part of my self. I couldn't deny its existence but had to face it in all its emptiness. My parents didn't understand and tried to get me to change my mind. I realized that we had such different experiences in life that we simply wouldn't be able to agree.  Dinner was being prepared and when we sat down to eat, our mom spoke about how she was watching a new show where they talk about interesting and generally unknown or surprising facts. The most reason was about how Jung and Freud were actually related sharing an aunt. I told her that I had never heard of this and that she shouldn't trust everything on the show.   I later looked it up and found that they were not closely related, sharing only 1.2% DNA. I saw the DNA comparisons in the google search results. I told my mom what I had found.",

We won the first two rounds easily but making clean shots and defending our base using the provided cover from small stone outcroppings.  The fights took place on a large open grassy field. At each end was a base which was a structure off to the side providing cover and more mounted guns.  The last fight was more difficult because they were using cover better. I was behind one of the gatling guns using mouth noises to indicate that I was firing at the giu camped directly outside of our base. At one point I ran out and found a green cone like Object and gave it to the other team. It was an item to make their gatling gun more powerful. He thanked me but barely gave me time to get back.  Their leader took a grapefruit sized bomb made of rock and threw it over to our side of the field near our base. We ran away, but I picked up our bomb made of green and activated it. I chased down their leader and waited till the bomb was almost ready to explode before tossing it at his feet. He tried to run away but I knocked him back and he fell on top of the bomb. It blew up and we won.  They offered to play a 4th game but I declined though my brother wanted to.",

We don’t make wine. There is some picking of fruits and a kitchen garden closer to the house, but it’s sustenance farming. We don’t have any animals. The house is vast. We aren’t the first tenants in it. My dad is there, my brother, my sister, and I think my step-mom and other members of the family that are always there. The dream fogs the others out, but I can feel them as bodies and presences. The main characters are my brother and my dad and I until my daughter and her ex-boyfriend arrive. As the dream starts, I’m in the kitchen. Everything is old. I feel like the floor is hard packed earth. The rooms maybe started as one room, which was the kitchen and everybody slept there. Some family added another room and then another room on top of that. So it’s not one big cohesive unit, it’s a whole bunch of different ones. It must be 700 years old. We keep discovering these things we didn’t know were there. I’m using a pup to pump water into the sink to wash dishes. The water is cold, it’s not heated.

There are bugs and things that only move in the dark and webs. No one ever uses it. We have a few things stored down there. There’s no electricity in the whole place. The torch in the torch holder is lit and we each have torches that we hold beside the one in the holder so we each have a light of our own. The only thing we can see is what the torch lights up, so as soon as you move from that spot you can feel the heavy damp of the darkness behind you. I’m sticking pretty close to my brother.

Toward the end of the dream I realize that what I should have done immediately is called the cops as soon as I saw my car was gone. Find a phone to use, like the conference center's phone, and my insurance company. But this girl. There's some interaction between us. I was uncomfortable from the get-go, and there was an interaction between us in the night that makes me even more uncomfortable. The next day she says, I liked it when you attacked me. I'm like, maybe we won't use that word, attacked. I don't remember what it was. It was very mild and innocent, but I'm afraid of how things look.",

I was nervous about it and I wasn’t wearing a mask, but I was covering my face with a white tissue. We were all driving somewhere and then we pulled over to this big dusty parking lot. We were going to get in the shuttles and I got really nervous about going in the shuttle. This big group of kids on tricycles and other things came charging through the parking lot. They were all black kids on tricycles and some other things. It looked like they knew where they were going. The next thing that happened was everybody came down a tube-like thing, like a slide, and one at a time. My nieces came down. Then my sister had a guy there and I didn’t like him. I knew that it wasn’t my ex brother-in-law but he had a similar energy and he was trying to impress the family. I did not like him at all and my sister was nervous about him meeting the family. She took forever to come down on her slide turn. Then we were in this car and I was trying to put these credit card numbers in and take turns with other people I don’t know. We’re in really close quarters trying to get these credit cards to work before we got to the game. Then I was carrying the speaker box and the front of it had lights in a Christmas tree design. Everybody was commenting on how fast it was for the game but I was really nervous about going somewhere in public.",

We were going to a place where I had gotten a wedding dress before and this was in the dream not in real life. We arrived and this lady was like, “I don’t have time, just try these on and you can buy them.” She started pulling dresses off the shelves and Dr. Donovan was like, “well what size do you think she is?” and she pulled down my top to show her how much bigger I was there when I got married. The lady said, “you don’t have room to put a ball between you and another person so probably a large or an extra large, just go grab them.” So Dr. Donovan and I went to go find large and extra-large off the racks. We got the sequined short dresses - I would not wear them right now in my current body...and we are in this big huge boutique and running around to find everything. They were in all these different colors like pink and they had sparkles on them. When I looked up beyond the store there were other aisles for big box store type stuff, but it looked like we were still inside of this boutique.",

His dad is wanting to make it into an entertainment room. He buys a big futon and sets it up. He’s very childlike in his excitement about this futon. He’s showing it to me and wants to make sure it’s the right size and fits and is not too heavy or too stiff, and it’s comfortable and in the right place in the cul-de-sac. It’s so strange because it goes between being outside and being an actual room. As the dream progresses more and more furniture shows up and the room starts to be enclosed with walls on two sides and then sliding glass doors on the other side. Curtains show up. There’s a couch now and a piano and side tables etched in gold. It’s quite fancy, actually. Josh’s dad is asking me, “Is this how you want this room set up? What do you think about the placement of all the furniture? What about the tv? Is there a better place for everything?” I’m looking at it. They have the tv set up against the sliding glass doors and the curtains are drawn. I’m like, “No, I think there’s a better way than to block these doors with furniture.” I can feel myself standing there contemplating a better arrangement. But they’re so happy with how it is. They’re trying to convince me of why it’s good. I’m like, “Yeah, just leave it, let it be.” Then the dream ends and I’m in a car. We’re driving around this same cul-de-sac and trying to figure out how to get back to that room. His dad is like, “I think if we take this way, we’ll end up where we want to be.” I can see that there’s this gate in between that cul-de-sac and where we want to be. If we go right, it takes us up a hill and I keep going like, “I don’t think this will get us where we want to go.” It’s very interesting, I just know that even though we can see that cul-de-sac and I can actually see the futon he bought, we can’t get to it in the car we’re in. we do have to drive up and aroun (...)",

I’ve just set my teacup down on my bedside table and I’m debating whether or not to take him out one more time before I go to sleep. He’s not housebroken yet. I know I’ve just taken him out so I think I have a couple of hours to sleep and I’m really tired. I close my eyes and go to sleep. I wake up abruptly, something startled me, a noise. In that startle, my arm shoots out and knocks the teacup off the bedside table. It falls to the floor and smashes. I pick the pulley up from the towel and wiggle my feet into my shoes. I walk out of the bedroom, up about five stairs and outside. It’s still the middle of the night, though. I set the puppy down in the grass. He snuffles around a little bit and I hear him peeing. We walk a little farther so he can poop. I think that he does so we go back in the house after spending a little time outside. I put him back on the towel, take my shoes off and get into bed. Then I look down and there’s poop on the towel. I think, “Oh no, I didn’t stay out long enough, I thought he pooped.’ I get another small piece of towel and pick the poops up. I walk across the hall and flush them down the toilet. I pick up the two towels and am looking around for something to put them in. I notice I have a dog crate in the corner but it doesn’t have a tray in the bottom. I wonder if you can buy those separately. I’m trying to find another towel, a clean towel for the puppy to lie on. Then some people that I know from yoga start to file into the room. The room turns into a gym. I still have the puppy. People are wanting a yoga class now. They see the puppy and start talking about him instead. They ask me what kind he is and such questions. There’s a commotion at the side of the room and I see two firefighters. They’re both dressed in the fireproof coveralls and one of them has an axe. I wonder if there’s a fire going on and if we should be vacating the room. I pick up the puppy (...)",

I’m like, “Whatever, I don’t know what y’all want but you need to move along.” Most of them leave, but this one girl won’t. She’s young, maybe 17 or 20. She is coming on so hard to Josh and I’m like, “What are you doing?” I’m not jealous because we have an open relationship, but I’m like, “Girlfriend, what are you doing? You need to know what you’re looking for and asking for.” She says to Josh, “Can you fuck me?” He’s like, “No.” But she won’t stop. He’s like, “Okay, if that’s what you want.” At this point, she’s taken all her clothes off and doing the most to seduce him. They get down right here in the living room. I’m kind of watching but also on my way into the bathroom, so i’m seeing this out of the corner of my eye.

I was thinking about passing through objects, but tried by patting something, and it was entirely solid and no interpenetration. An old style picket fence that need paint five or ten years ago. A few old fruit trees. I'm flying around the fruit trees, just taking it in, enjoying being alive. The guy comes along on a riding mower and looks directly at me, but I'm not sure whether he saw me or not. He didn't react, kept on mowing.

I’ve told him several times that if he just goes off the main road there’s a whole grid of side roads that will take us the same direction, but the chances of getting caught on a side road are greatly reduced. First we’re on a highway. It looks like the old Number 7. Again, I’m saying, “Why are we on this highway? It’s the only main route that goes here and there are police on it all the time.” He finally agrees to go off on a side road, but it’s not the one I suggested, it’s the one that takes us in the opposite direction. I think at least that will shake the police for a little while because they’re going to be looking for us traveling the opposite way. We do this for an agonizingly long twenty minutes. It feels like hours where I notice every single little thing as I’m looking at the windows. I’m hypervigilant and looking out the back window to see if I can see a  (...)",

There’s this big white fur rug in the middle of the floor. I think maybe this is home. The rug needs to be vacuumed, so I’m trying to vacuum it and make sure I don’t pull any fur out, but the vacuum isn’t working. I think maybe I’ll try to comb the whole thing out, but it’s tedious and taking a very long time. I try to come up with another way to clean this large white fur rug. He and I are talking about and while we’re talking, a mutual friend (again not anybody I recognize from real life) comes in. She is straight and has long dark hair. She’s practicing to be a wedding planner. This other woman is here in this room to see her. Me and the gay man are fussing with the rug. The two women are sitting at a table. The one who is learning to be a wedding planner or something is organizing something for the other woman. She has baked twelve different kinds of cake with different flavors and either buttercream frosting or fondant frosting. The cakes are all different colors. Some of them have gold foils, berries and flowers. They’re really gorgeous. Maybe there are twenty of them. There are so many that they don’t even fit on the table. It’s crazy because the woman who is going to be the planner is actually putting the fondant on the cake as she is having the other woman taste it. I want to have some cake and keep going, “Hey is that cake gluten-free or grain-free by any chance? Can I eat it? What’s in the fondant?” I love fondant icing and really want to try some of the cakes. I get a little leftover piece from one of the ones they’ve already tasted. They can’t decide and so far no decision has been made. I get a taste of one and don’t think I want to eat this because I’m pretty sure it’s not gluten-free. I do have a nibble of the fondant and it’s okay but kind of plain. I do end up having a crumb of the cake and it’s burnt. I’m like, “Oh god, (...)",

We took everything out of the house when we bought it, including the drywall, the plumbing, and the electricity. We created three apartments from it. I lived in one on the main floor for a little while until the basement was fixed up into an apartment, and then I moved out. I kind of supervised the building, collected the rents and did day-to-day jobs that a landlady would do. In this dream, I’ve returned after being absent for a long period of time. It’s because I want to sell the house and I want to move myself. It’s like I’m living far away from there like I do in waking life. In waking life I want to move and I’m trying to get the money I need to do this. I’ve got a couple houses picked out that I want to move to. They’re across the street from the Fairground. I just don’t know how much they are. I’ve contacted one of my friends who is a real estate agent to help me with this. She meets me at the house on A. Street. We enter. We start looking around. She’s doing it with her real estate agent’s eye. I’ve got a clipboard with paper and am going to write down the things she says to do to stage the house and what she arrives at as an estimated value. As we’re doing this, the tenant comes down from the upper floor apartment. She talks to us for a little while about mundane things. Then she says that she would like to move into the main floor apartment when the house sells. I tell her, “Well that’s a good idea except that you are on student welfare and they pay rent directly to us. This apartment is much more expensive than the smaller apartment that you have on the upper floor. How can you afford to pay for this? Are you working now?” She says she’s not working but she thinks she can budget so that her student welfare still covers the more expensive rent. I tell her that I don’t think this is realistic and I do some math with her. I  (...)",

She tells me to go get some coconut milk. I leave the kitchen and go into the pantry. It’s quite a vast pantry with lots of shelves and very well organized. I’m reading the labels and nothing is quite right. All the cans that I think are coconut milk aren’t. I’m in there a long time trying to find coconut milk and I think I’ve been gone too long. I come back out and tell her I couldn’t find any. She remains silent, she doesn’t reply. Then I leave the kitchen and go into another room.

I lift my torso away from the ground, roll over to my other side, and then onto my stomach. From my stomach, I roll onto my right side and immediately into child’s pose, then lift my torso and roll to the left and onto my back. I’m making the movements really smooth.

If they had weapons it was only a staff or a shield. They didn't believe it was dangerous inside the church and were terribly unprepared. I was supposed to be one of them, but I wasn't going on their suicide mission. I went to where there were more of the warrior priests and donned my uniform. I would blend in but would not go inside. But once I entered the line of people going into the church, everyone shoved me to the front. I tried to get away but there was no escape. The doors opened and a monster came out before I could shut them. It was a mace lying on the ground threateningly. It had a wooden shaft and a large bulbous three pronged head of metal or stone. I pulled out my weapon, some sort of bolas and began hitting it repeatedly as it lay on the ground. Then I was in a minivan crashing through the doors.

I open it but the whole time I’m like, “Why are you all drinking?” We’re at a gathering, maybe it’s Christmas or New Year’s, I don’t know, but there’s a celebration happening.

I sort of get tired of all this. I go out of the house. All I can see are impressions of mountains and the very classic Swiss Alps landscape. I’m looking down from a high vantage point, a bird’s eye view. I can see houses down below and the mountains and a river. This is where everything gets really fuzzy.

I could make out \"coffee\" on the menu but didn't want to order coffee in a bar. I instead ordered a large water along with some food and planned to find a menu to read.   A drunk man approached and sat down. He was massive and was thankful he seemed to be in a decent mood and was paying no attention to me. He had been playing poker and I thought about asking him how the game was going but decided against it.   One of the prostitutes, a girl of maybe 15, approached me and sat down offering to read the menu for me. I was uncomfortable but wanted to treat her well so accepted her help. Another girl walked over, a black girl of similar age and I quickly said, \"I'm not interested.\" Everyone else in the bar reacted to this, laughing because of how I had dissed her. They had misunderstood my intentions.   Things must have gone poorly for T. R. because he told us that we all needed to leave.

    "text": "I was being chased by somebody or something and running from building to building and then I kind of melted into the second dream where I had my dog Pinto in his stroller and we were meeting my family for a Christmas show. We took an elevator to the top floor of what looks like the space needle in Seattle and we sat down at the end of this crescent shaped couch. I kind of had a bad view of the play or festivities, but then an unattractive guy sat down next to me. He was black and tall and wearing a gray sweater and jeans and boots. He was sitting with people that he knew. We all said hello and then we went around and said our names twice. The play started and I couldn’t see my family but I was okay and somehow the guy next to me put his arm around me and started kissing me. He was a really good kisser and in my dream I remember thinking it’s been so long and I was embarrassed because I felt like there was so much spit in my mouth! I eventually excused myself to use the restroom but before I did I looked down and my nipple was showing! I left Pinto there in the stroller while I went to the bathroom and I was gone for a while, maybe seven or eight minutes, and I was blowing my nose trying to get the last of everything out because my nose was running. When I went back I was worried about having left him alone for so long and then the person next to me wasn’t there anymore but it was okay. The show was almost over and then I woke up",

I wondered if they had translated ths film but changed it slightly for its English audience. There was a girl with dark blonde hair and open hills and meadows. The movie wove in and out of the dream reality. Sometimes we were watching, other times we were in the film.",

    "text": "I’m with a ton of people I don’t know and we’re on a tour. The astrologer who I know from my studies is there and we’re in this huge area that reminds me of the Hawaiian Hilton where they have these big fake rocks by a pool and you can climb over and around them and there’s a slide you can go down. So we’re in this building with lots of rocks and water, but it’s also an old sewing shop. There are all these sewing patterns everywhere, still in their envelopes. The woman who owns the shop is showing us around. But it’s not a shop, it’s way bigger, and an open space. The tour is over. To get out of the building, you have to climb in a very specific pattern over these rocks. I watch somebody ahead of me. We get to this one section and it’s kind of like bouldering. Instead of taking hand and footholds, they decide to slide down the rock face, thinking it’s not so far. I watch them slide and am like, “Oh, that’s far.” They land in the pool beneath them, but the pool is not particularly deep.” I’m like, “Oh no, okay, I’m not going to do that.” Then the astrologer goes and she’s a much bigger woman. She shows me how to use the handholds and footholds. She misses and falls down the rock face. I’m like, “Oh no, this is not good.” I see some younger girls, like nine or ten years old and I watch where they put their hands. They manage to get down off this part where the others were sliding and slipping. I follow them and end up in this place where there are even more patterns lined up on a bench. I recognize some of them from my mom’s sewing patterns from when I was a kid. There are other ones that are new in their envelopes. I’m looking at them but not spending a lot of time because I know it’s time to go. I just kind of try to keep going. Then the dream switches. I’m in a house that I’m sharing with a bunch of people. We’re in the kitchen area. I think it’s mostly women and possibly my friends Shawna and Janet from high school, but I’m not sure. There are others I don’t recog (...)",

    "text": "My dad and I were walking their dog Luna down an empty highway. It was a cloudy day. There weren't any cars out and we had the road to ourselves. As we walked, it grew cloudier and darker and when I looked up, I began to worry that it would rain. We decided that we would turn back before we got wet. I took Luna and began running.  Then I launched myself into the air and flew, spinning and becoming like a tornado. I wondered how Luna was going to keep up, but for some reason I was not worried.",
