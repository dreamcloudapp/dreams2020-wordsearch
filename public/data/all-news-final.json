The Falcon engines deliberately shut down, and the booster tumbled out of control and crashed into the Atlantic. The capsule, meanwhile, parachuted into the ocean. The flight lasted about nine minutes.",

When Trump spoke to the American Farm Bureau Federation's convention last year, he urged farmers to have his back. They'd been suffering financially in the fallout from his China trade war. Trump's follow-up speech Sunday in Austin, Texas, gave him a chance to make the case that he kept two of his trade promises. Trump signed a preliminary trade deal with China last week. He's expected to sign the North American trade agreement soon. Trump told the convention: “We did it.”",

Federal prosecutors announced the charges at a Thursday afternoon news conference in El Paso.

Turkish officials said gunfire from the Greek side Wednesday killed one migrant and wounded five others — which Athens flatly rejected as “fake news.” The two countries are historic regional rivals and their relations were already tense before the border crisis over offshore exploration rights. Greek forces used tear gas, stun grenades and water cannons Wednesday in clashes near the Greek village of Kastanies. That's beside a border fence that covers a small section of the 212-kilometer (132-mile) frontier not demarcated by the Evros river. ",

The second-generation iPhone SE announced Wednesday will sell for as little as $399. That's a 40% markdown from the most affordable iPhone 11 unveiled last year. Even before the pandemic, consumers had begun to balk at paying large sums for smartphones. And now high-priced gadgets are expected to become an even tougher sell as the economy plunges into it worst downturn in more than a decade. ",

A reformer and teacher who trained a generation of family practitioners in Lombardy, Stella now occupies a place of tragic distinction in the pandemic in Italy. The 67-year-old is the first name on the list of more than 150 medical doctors who died in the coronavirus crisis. His longtime friend and colleague Alessandro Colombo said “it was like the captain of doctors was hit.”",

Staff might take turns working alternate days to reduce crowding. One-way paths will be laid out for better flow. Elevators could be limited to a few people at a time. Floor markings or sensors will remind people how far apart to stand. And there will be a lot more cleaning. ",

But on Saturday, go-go music — a distinctive D.C. offshoot of funk — blared from a truck that looked more like a parade float. Impromptu dance parties popped up. A black man shared a fist bump with a black police officer. People used chalk to write messages of support on the street. The displays of levity, unfolding against the backdrop of damaged buildings marked with graffiti, amounted to a moment of catharsis for a city and nation in crisis.",

The mayor said the island’s migrant holding center was built for a maximum capacity of 95 people and was already holding 950 when the latest passengers arrived. The 250 who arrived between Friday night and Saturday are being kept on the dock until a solution is found.  ",

Intelligence officials confirmed in recent days that foreign actors are actively seeking to compromise the private communications of “U.S. political campaigns, candidates and other political targets” while working to compromise the nation’s election infrastructure. There is no evidence they've succeeded in penetrating campaigns or state election systems, but Democrat Joe Biden’s presidential campaign confirmed this week that it has faced multiple related threats. Still, foreign interference largely remains an afterthought in the 2020 contest, even as Republicans and Democrats alike concede it poses a serious threat. ",

Over 8 million students in Spain are beginning the academic year this week or next. More than half a million people have contracted the virus in Spain and at least 29,500 have died with it. The country currently has the highest rate of contagion in western Europe.",

But asking a stranger to put one on could result in a volatile situation, so experts say it might be best to steer clear of people without masks in public if you can.

Earlier this month, a study testing a similar drug from Eli Lilly in hospitalized patients was paused and later stopped because the drug didn't seem to help. Experts say previous testing suggests these antibody drugs may help most when given early in infection.",

They include allegations that Trump election observers didn’t have the access they sought or that mail-in ballots were fraudulently cast. ",

The agency said Thursday that the deal with ClearSpace SA will lead to the “first active debris removal mission” in 2025, in which a custom-made spacecraft will capture and bring down part of a rocket once used to deliver a satellite into orbit. Experts have long warned that hundreds of thousands of pieces of space debris circling the planet — including an astronaut’s lost mirror — pose a threat to functioning satellites and even the International Space Station. The object being removed from orbit is a so-called Vespa payload adapter that was used to hold and then release a satellite in 2013.",

Many Jewish Americans are already accustomed to more intimate celebrations of a holiday focused more on the home than on the synagogue. That includes Haredim or ultra-Orthodox communities, some of whom mounted a recent successful Supreme Court challenge to New York restrictions on in-person worship. Still, the legal victory won’t mean much as far as their plans. ",

Fauci endorsed the decision of U.S. officials to require negative COVID-19 tests before letting people from Britain enter the U.S. and declined to weigh in on whether that step should have been taken sooner. ",

In so many ways, 2020's pandemic-induced isolation just threw our dependence on technology into overdrive. But for all the winners — like Zoom, e-commerce and video games — there were plenty of losers, too. Virtual reality sounded like a good escape, but it never took off. Quibi fizzled and Uber and Lyft saw their ridership plummet. As for Big Tech? Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google did well financially. But regulators are breathing down their neck. ",

Forced to hunker down at home, more people are setting up coops and raising their own chickens, which provide an earthy hobby, animal companionship and a steady supply of fresh eggs. Amateur chicken-keeping has been growing in popularity in recent years as people become more focused on environmental sustainability and the food they eat. The pandemic has accelerated those trends, prompting more people to take the leap into poultry parenthood. Businesses that sell chicks, coops and other supplies say they’ve seen a surge in demand since the pandemic took hold.",

    "text": "The Christmas Day bombing in downtown Nashville led to communications outages over hundreds of miles in the southern U.S., raising concerns about the vulnerability of U.S. networks. Widespread service outages followed the explosion, which damaged a major AT&T network hub, extended hundreds of miles to at least four neighboring states, disrupting 911 call centers, hospitals and flights out of the Nashville airport. While “nearly all services' were restored by Monday evening, three days after the blast, some outages remained through Wednesday -- as do questions about what the U.S. can do to prevent future disruptions from attack or natural disasters.",

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Thursday he had accepted Rod Phillips’s resignation as minister hours after Phillips returned home from a more than two-week stay on the island of St. Barts. He'd gone on vacation despite government guidelines urging people to avoid nonessential travel. The trip has created a political problem for the premier himself.",

The company said the hackers were able to view some of the code underlying Microsoft software, but weren’t able to make any changes to it. Microsoft said its defense plans assumed that hackers could see its code and that it found no evidence of hacker access to customer data or any indications that its systems were used to attack others.",
